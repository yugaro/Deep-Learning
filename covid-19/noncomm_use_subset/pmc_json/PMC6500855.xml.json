Diseases caused by aetiologic agents of respiratory distress, stunted growth, and drop in egg production cause great economic losses to poultry producers worldwide. Individually, they can cause diseases that are exercerbated when co-infections with other viral and bacterial agents are involved. Notable infectious agents that have been implicated in respiratory infections of poultry, include avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Mycoplasma spp., avian metapneumovirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Villegas, 1998).",

The virus is classified in the genus gammacoronavirus, sub-family, Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/). The virus may give rise to different serotypes through recombination among different strains of the virus or by spontaneous mutations in the genes. Several circulating serotypes of the virus which may not confer cross protection on each other have been identified in poultry worldwide. It is, therefore, imperative to identify serotypes circulating in different localities for the choice of effective vaccine (Bijlenga et al., 2004; Thor et al., 2011). The most prevalent serotype worldwide being the Massachusetts-type (Mass) commonly used as a vaccine candidate (Gaba et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010). In spite of the widely used vaccine(s), IB remains the most commonly reported respiratory disease of poultry globally (Thor et al., 2011). ",

In Nigeria, however, the first documented evidence of suspected IB disease was by Adene and Ojo (1976). Since the first report in Nigeria, there seems to have been a progressive increase in the prevalence of IB in the country without much attention compared with other prevailing poultry diseases like Newcastle, Gumboro, and avian influenza. Komolafe et al. (1990) reported a seroprevalence of 3.3% from the south-eastern part of Nigeria. Thereafter, other reports have established high (15.3%\u201389%) seroprevalence of IB (Emikpe et al., 2010; Mungadi et al., 2015; Oyejide et al., 1988; Owoade et al., 2006) but none of these studies have identified the different serotypes in circulation nor attempt to establish a causal relationship with marked drop in egg production. In another report, Ducatez et al. (2009) identified a novel genotype of IBV from birds with inapparent signs of infection in South West Nigeria.",

At post-mortem, lesions observed include cloudy air sacs, frothy and congested lungs, whitish, cheesy materials on the serosal surface of the intestine, white nodules on the surface of the ventricles, proventriculus and intestines, and presence of ascitic fluid in the abdomen. These signs and lesions are consistent with findings from previous reports (Awad et al., 2014b; Ballal et al., 2005). Due to the similarities in clinical and pathological lesions presented by infections involving respiratory viruses, clinician that based their diagnosis on these non-pathognomonic signs may miss the aetiological agents.

Upon inoculation of ECEs with the tissue homogenate, no noticeable changes were observed in the embryos in the first few passages. However, at passage four, embryo death with characteristic IB lesions, including curling, dwarfing, and hemorrhages on the embryos (13 d of age) were conspicuously discernible (Fig. 2). Allantoic fluids harvested from the eggs of both dead and live embryos did not cause agglutination of chicken red blood cells in spot hemagglutination test (data not shown) and this confirms the absence of hemagglutinating agent. In this study, we have shown that IBV which is less described and often given less attention and not NDV or AIV was the causative agent of infection in the 54-wk-old laying birds showing respiratory signs and severe drop in egg production. Although ND was first suspected by the consulting clinician due to its enzootic status in Nigeria. In a limited study, the prevalence of IB was found to equal that of ND confirming the increasing important enzootic status of IB in Nigeria poultry (Shittu unpublished data). In this study, successful isolation of IBV in embryonating eggs was accomplished after four blind passages with the embryos developing lesions characteristic of IB such as stunting and dwarfing (Fig. 2). For IBV isolation, ECE and tracheal organ cultures (TOC) are substrates of choice although TOC has an edge over ECE in that stasis of the tracheal cilia could be observed in the former upon primary inoculation (OIE, 2008). In this study, ECE isolation technique was found to be equally useful.",

However, this seemed not to have protected the birds against morbidity, mortality, and decreased egg production. It has been reported that chickens with low antibody level to IBV serotype could experience severe drop in egg production, whereas those with high antibody level are less affected in terms of egg quality and production possibly as a result of immune protection (Ballal et al., 2005). Available literature show that the use of inactivated IB vaccines alone does not confer adequate protection on the birds except where they are first primed with live attenuated IB vaccines during the early stages of production (Cook et al., 2012). In addition, IBV serotypes do not cross-protect (Jackwood et al., 2010), thus the vaccine must be designed based on circulating serotypes in the locality. In Plateau State, there are no available data on the circulating IBV strains. Although most vaccines being used on the field in Nigeria are predominatly Mass serotype, detection of other serotypes in this investigation is a further indication and support speculation that the vaccine strains being used differ from some of the serotypes in circulation. Furthermore, Ducatez et al. (2009) identified a novel IBV serotype \u201cIBADAN\u201d from southwestern Nigeria and no information exists on the ability of the vaccine strains in use to protect birds against this novel strain (de Wit et al., 2010). It is, however, not known if this serotype circulates in the northern part of the country.",

This clearly shows that the three IBV serotypes are present in the farm and may be in circulation in Plateau State with the possibility of other hitherto unreported serotypes. As reported by Jackwood (2012), several serotypes and variants of IBV circulate around the world with some having specificity for a particular location, making them indigenous to those places. Such may include the newly described serotype by Ducatez et al. (2009) which we could not test for in our samples due to unavailability of strain specific diagnostic reagent. The Mass strain of IBV has been reported to be widespread across the globe possibly due to its use as a vaccine (de Wit et al., 2010). In Nigeria, breeder stocks are often vaccinated with live IBV vaccine using Mass-like strains at much younger ages (Ducatez et al., 2009). However, in this case, a trivalent killed-adjuvanted vaccine containing IBV was said to have been administered without prior priming with live IBV vaccine. As previously reported (Bijlenga et al., 2004; de Wit et al., 2010), antibody response to killed-adjuvanted IBV vaccine without priming the birds with live attenuated IB vaccine are usually poor. It can, therefore, be deduced that the high titre of antibodies to the three IBV serotypes detected in this study (Table 3) may not have emanated from vaccination, but could be a result of recent or continuous infection with circulating strains of the virus as also shown by molecular detection and virus isolation. To the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, co-circulation of multiple serotypes of IBV as described here is the first documented report from Nigeria.",

In the present case prior to further laboratory, most clinical diagnoses are based on signs and pathological lesions. Future observation and investigation should be designed to investigate the different IBV serotypes and genotypes in circulation across the country with the aim of producing vaccine (s), based on the identified serotypes, for combating the menace of IB in the Nigerian poultry population.",
