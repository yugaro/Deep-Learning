The main risk factor for AECOPD development is considered an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus (up to 60%) or by bacteria (responsible approximately for 40% of those events) [7,8]. The significance of viral infections has been recognized during the last decade by the development and clinical application of newer molecular techniques able to detect viral species that are not easily detected by serology or viral cultures such as human Metapneumovirus [9]. Recently, we evaluated the epidemiology of viral infections in a cohort of patients with AECOPD where we showed that viral infections were strongly associated with AECOPD development independent of the stage of COPD and an infection with both a viral and a bacterial pathogen was common in these patients [10]. In this cohort, we had a high percentage of elderly patients with AECOPD due to viral infections. For this reason, we conducted the present study aiming to investigate possible differences among elderly and non-elderly patients with AECOPD of viral origin.",

Briefly, in this cohort study, all patients (aged 40-90 years) who have visited the Emergency Department of a tertiary care hospital and were admitted into an inpatient facility because of a COPD exacerbation (according to GOLD criteria), without hospitalization during the last three months or use of antibiotics during the last 30 days and without a diagnosis of bronchial asthma were included [8]. The patients reported no history of infection during the last month and were not receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy. The study period lasted from January 2008 to June 2010. The study has taken approval by the ethical committee of the hospital and all the patients recruited in the study signed written informed consent. In the absence of a clear definition for \u201celderly\u201d patient in the medical literature, the age cut off chosen for this study was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) definition for elderly. According to this statement most developed world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of \"elderly\" or older person. While this definition is considered somewhat arbitrary, however it is usually associated with the age at which a person can begin to receive pension benefits. Currently, there is no United Nations standard numerical criterion, but the UN agreed to a cutoff of 60+ years in order to refer to the older population [11-14].",

This method is able to detect and characterize the 17 most frequent types of human viruses responsible for respiratory infections, by identifying very small quantities of viral genomic material. It uses a sequence which corresponds to a highly preserved region within the viral genome and binding probes specific to each respiratory virus type. Viruses analyzed include, human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) type A and B, human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) type A and B Influenza virus (all types A, B, C), Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza virus (hPIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4 (subtypes A and B), Enterovirus (Echovirus), Adenovirus, Coronavirus and Bocavirus. The samples were collected in Thin Prep CytoLyt\u00ae solution and centrifuged at 2000g. The molecular procedure was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, viral DNA/RNA was extracted by using 200\u03bcl of clinical sample mixed with lysis buffer and then allowed to stand in room temperature for 15 minutes. Isopropanol was added and centrifugation was performed at 13000 rpm for 20 min followed by removal of the supernatant. Then the precipitate was resuspended with 1000\u03bcl 70% ethanol followed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed again and the sample was left to dry for 15 min (until there were no ethanol residues left). At the end the pellet was resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of dilution solution. The viral DNA/RNA extracts were stored at - 20\u00b0C until amplification. Virus amplification was performed via two RT (reverse transcriptase) Multiplex PCR reactions of a specific 120-330 bp fragment of the viral genome. The PCR employed the following thermal cycler settings: 1 cycle of 45 min at 45\u00b0C and 15 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 30 sec at 95\u00b0C, 1,5 min at 50\u00b0C and 1 min at 68\u00b0C and 1 final cycle of 10 min at 68\u00b0C. Visualization of the amplified product was performed on a platform based on low-density micro-arrays, which is called Array Tube (AT). This detection system is based on the precipitation of an insoluble product at those sites of the AT where the hybridization of the products amplified by specific molecular probes is produced. The amplified products are labeled with biotin during the PCR. After the amplification, they hybridize with their respective specific probes that are immobilized in specific and known sites of the AT, after which they are incubated with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. The conjugate binds via streptavidin with the biotin present in the amplified products (which are also bound to their specific probes), while in the presence of o-dianisidine, the peroxidase activity of the conjugate induces the appearance of an insoluble product which precipitates at the hybridization sites of the AT\u201d [10].",

In this study when comparing the frequency of viral infections among elderly and non-elderly patients no differences were detected. A possible explanation for this could be the fact that COPD is a chronic systemic inflammatory syndrome affecting the immune response independently of the age and making these patients more prone to such infections [15,16]. The elderly is a large and even growing population, proportional to the age of the general hospitalized population. This group of patients is characterized by a decline of the immunological response to infection, principally due to functional insufficiency of monocytes and macrophages that results to inadequate phagocytosis, by the lack of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (so are naive T-cells due to thymus gland involution), by the loss of memory capacity of mature T-cells exhibiting a poor and/or altered cytokine production and by the decrease of the number of circulating B-cells resulting in a weaker response to antigenic challenges through immunoglobulin production [17,18]. Elderly usually have higher rates of vaccination against influenza from their primary care physicians than non-elderly (although both are at risk) [15,16]. However, no difference was detected either in influenza virus or other viruses\u2019 detection rates. This could be explained by the fact that immune responses to vaccination decline substantially with age thus the elderly have impaired humoral and cell mediated immune responses to influenza vaccines compared with younger adults [13,14,19-21]. It also points to the need for better prevention measures against respiratory viruses for this population.",

Human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs) are considered to be one of the most common causes of lower respiratory tract infections in children [32-34] but it is difficult to understand their biologic significance in this cohort. One possible explanation could have been the occurrence of a clonal hPIV outbreak during the study period. When analyzing the seasonal pattern of viral infections no statistically differences were noted although is well known, that COPD patients present more commonly exacerbations during the cold seasons (winter-autumn) and viral infections have a higher prevalence during this period associated with a longer recovery period, longer in house stay and increased likelihood of hospital admission [12,35]. Also, despite the important role of viral infections, in this study it was difficult to examine their true pathogenic role since for some of these viruses there is an increasing evidence that they could colonize the respiratory tract; such colonizers may act as modulators of the local immune response in a subsequent bacterial upper tract infection in an already susceptible patient but the exact interaction of bacterial with viral colonizers is an issue for further debate [36, 37].",
