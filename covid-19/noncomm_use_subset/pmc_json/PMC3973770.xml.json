FeLV was discovered among cats that lived in a cluster-household where several animals had developed lymphosarcoma [19]. The virus is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus. Cats are usually infected by direct contact with infected cats [12,31,33], mostly via oronasal exposure to saliva and nasal secretions containing high levels of the virus especially through mutual grooming and sharing food dishes or water bowls [11,12,17]. Vertical transmission occasionally occurs [35] but is of secondary importance. FeLV-associated diseases include a variety of neoplastic disorders, anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, neurological disorders, reproductive failure in female cats, and numerous secondary infections caused by FeLV-induced immunosuppression [12,34]. Although the period of disease progression is highly variable, 83% of FeLV-infected cats die within 3 years [29].",

            "text": "Given these findings, the accurate diagnosis of FeLV infection is very important to break the cycle of horizontal and vertical transmission in feline populations. Several diagnostic tools have been introduced in veterinary clinics: the passive hemagglutination test [37], complement fixation test [36], immunofluorescent assay [13], enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [25,26,27,28], saliva test [10], and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) [7]. The RDT, also known as the lateral flow rapid test, has several advantages such as quick turnaround, cost-effectiveness, and usability in locations far removed from laboratories. Consequently, the RDT has been widely used in clinics and elsewhere [30,39]. In this report, we describe the preparation of monoclonal antibodies specific for the p27 of FeLV. We also provide details about the development of an RDT system using these antibodies and clinical characteristics of the assay.",

Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the core p27 protein were generated as follows. Spleen cells from BALB/c mice (7-week-old females; DBL, Korea) immunized with purified rec. p27 were fused to sp2/0 myeloma cells. Rec. p27 was mixed with an equivalent volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) for the first immunization and with same volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) for the second and third rounds of immunization. Immunizations were carried out at 2-week intervals by injecting the mice with 0.5 mL (50 \u00b5g) of rec. p27. The anti-p27 antibody titer was measured by an ELISA using plates coated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of purified FeLV. When the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) was greater than 0.2, the next boosting step was conducted. The boosting immunization was performed by injecting the mice with 0.2 mL (50 \u00b5g) of rec. p27 via the tail vein. After 3 days, cell fusion with sp2/0 myeloma cells was performed according to the method of K\u00f6hler and Milstein. Based on the screening steps using plates coated with rec. p27 and the purified FeLV virus, hybridomas producing the antibodies of interest were selected and subcloned from a single cell using the limited dilution method. The hybridomas were used to produce ascitic fluid in the BALB/c mice, and the immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified with a protein G-coupled Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, USA). Isotyping of the cloned mAbs was carried out using goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Among the antibodies produced by the hybridoma, 8F8B5 was selected as the capture antibody and 8G7D1 was selected for conjugation. These antibodies were specific for FeLV p27 and had the highest affinity constants (Table 1).",

Therefore, the RDT using 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 which had a detection limit of 2 ng/mL for rec. p27 and 12.5 \u00d7 104 IU/mL for the virus would be very useful for practical diagnosis. According to other previous reports [14,15], the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of current commercialized diagnostic kits including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) range from 92.0~94.7% and 97.5~99.8%, respectively. The RDT system is typically believed to be less sensitive than an EIA because RDT does not include a washing step and various blocking reagents are used to prevent non-specific reactions. The RDT kit developed in the present study was found to possess excellent diagnostic properties (a sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 98.5%). Compared to the BioNote Rapid FeLV/FIV Combo Kit (cat. no: RC12-04, lot no: 1204172; Alere BioNote, Korea), the RDT we developed showed a lower level of analytical sensitivity (data not shown). Using 12 FeLV-positive specimens, both RDTs identified all samples as positive but the band signal of the RDT we produced was stronger than that of the commercial RDT (data not shown).

A POCT for FeLV infection is important because it would facilitate field-testing of cats, especially stray animals, by veterinarians. In our study, none of the 155 household cats were FeLV-positive while 21 out of 127 stray cats produced positive results. To prevent the spread of FeLV infection among cat populations, stray animals should be rapidly diagnosed and treated. The RDT developed in our study could be used as a promising POCT tool for diagnosing FeLV infection in conjunction with other conventional antigen tests such as ELISAs [25,26,27,28] and nucleic acid testing [1,2,3].",
