Numerous clinical trials\u2014such as APOLLO 2, C-Cure 3, CADUCEUS 4, and SCIPIO 5\u2014have demonstrated the cardiac regenerative potential of various stem cells. Subsequent studies demonstrated the lack of long term stem cell engraftment and differentiation 6-8. The majority of the beneficial effects of stem cells come from the secretome 9, which includes extracellular microvesicles (EMVs). There are three known types of EMVs: apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes. All are composed of a lipid bilayer, yet exosomes are differentiated by being formed within endosomes 10. Acting as mediators of paracrine signals, exosomes protect and carry proteins and miRNA between cells 11-16.",

Despite the efficacy of exosomes, the methods for delivery to the heart are less than ideal. Previous studies have used both intracoronary and intramyocardial injections, with intramyocardial delivery being the more effective of the two 20. While intramyocardial injections are acceptable in animal studies, in a clinical setting it is a much more serious procedure requiring a physician to perform the catheterization procedure 21. Ideally, exosomes would be delivered intravenously, but it has been shown that the majority of intravenous injected exosomes are absorbed within the liver 22-24. To offset the non-specific delivery, in our previous study 25 we utilized a dosage that was approximately ten times greater than what was used for intramyocardial studies 18 as shown in Table 1. In this study, we create infarct-targeting exosomes, through the use of a cardiac homing peptide (CHP) 26,27, to increase the efficacy and decrease the effective dose of intravenously delivered exosomes.",

The media was conditioned on the cells for an extended period of time: 14 days for cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) 18,20, 5 days for HT1080 29 (MilliporeSigma; St. Louis, MO). The HT1080-XOs were only used for the ex vivo targeting experiment; all other experiments used CDC-XOs. The conditioned media was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm sterilization filter to remove any cell particulates or apoptotic bodies, then concentrated and buffer exchanged to PBS using a 100 kDa ultrafiltration column (EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA). Sizes and concentrations of the isolated exosomes were ascertained using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA; NanoSight, Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom). For electron microscopy, exosomes were stained using uranyl oxalate following a previously described protocol 30. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed using 5 \u03bcg of protein on 4-15% gradient gels (Bio-rad; Hercules, CA) and transferred using a wet transfer method.",

Exosome size was confirmed to be 95 nm via NTA and TEM imaging confirmed the round morphology of exosomes (Figure 1C-D). It was not possible to directly determine the exosome labelling; NTA was not able to differentiate between labelled and unlabeled exosomes (Figure 1C). Instead we used indirect methods to test whether the addition of a targeting peptide would increase retention of exosomes. To do so, exosomes were incubated on slide sections of rat kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and infarcted heart. Exosomes were tracked and quantified by DiI labelling. It has been shown that exosomes demonstrate innate homing abilities 35. Based upon the fluorescence integrated density taken from a series of images, CHP-tagged exosomes exhibited improved targeting to the infarcted heart (Figure 1E-F). In the other organs, the liver showed a decreased signal of CHP-XOs when compared to Scr-XOs. These data indicate that CHP conjugation is able to increase on-target and decreases off-target delivery of systemically administered exosomes.",

Exosomes secreted by cardiosphere-derived stem cells have been shown to promote cardiac regeneration 18,20,41. It has been indicated that the beneficial effects of exosomes are due to its ability to shuttle miRNA between cells 11-16. CDC-XOs contain numerous miRNAs, in particular miR21 and miR146a 18, both of which have been shown to have beneficial effects on the injured myocardium 42-46. miR21 reduces myocardial apoptosis by modulating expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), FasL, and AKT pathways 47-49. miR146a represses interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), reducing activation of nuclear factor \u03ba\u0392 (NF-\u03ba\u0392) 18,44. The effects of the miRNAs do not appear to be the result of any single miRNA, but rather the effects are dependent upon multiple miRNAs working in tandem 18,49. When combined, miR21 and miR146a result in significant reduction of p38 mitogen-associated kinase phosphorylation (p-p38 MAPK) 49. As miRNAs do not require an exact match to the target mRNA, miRNAs can repress many different proteins 50-56. When co-expressed or inhibited, this leads to multiple interactions and alterations as overlapping portions of pathways are modulated 50,57-59. Of the many possible outcomes of the miRNA modulation, we demonstrate that CHP-XOs promote cardiac repair through reduced scar size (Figure 3D-E), increased cardiac proliferation (Figure 4A-B), and increased angiogenesis (Figure 4C-D).",

            "text": "The nano-scale size of exosomes has a dichotomous effect on the therapeutic potential of exosomes. Their small size allows exosomes to traverse capillary beds in the lungs and other tissues, which can trap cells or larger particles, but simultaneously reduces the rate of extravasation of the exosomes to the hypothesized target tissue 60. When delivered intravenously, large amounts of exosomes have been shown to accumulate in off target organs such as the liver 22-24. Thus far, no studies have definitively shown any side effects of excess exosome injection, though one study did report death of one animal when receiving large doses of intravenous exosomes, possibly due to pulmonary embolism 60. Drug targeting has primarily been studied as a means to reduce the negative off-target effects of chemotherapeutic drugs 61-63, although there has been an increased interest in drug targeting for cardiac regeneration 64-73. Following myocardial infarction, the myocardium undergoes several changes that can be exploited for targeting. One such change is an increase in vascular permeability, analogous to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in cancer, allowing for increased extravasation of liposomes 74. Changes in protein expression as well as exposure of normally intracellular proteins such as myosin have been utilized for targeting. Due to their high specificity, antibodies and antibody fragments have been the targeting molecule of choice 75. Recent studies also showed that platelet membranes could be utilized to target cells to the infarct heart 76. Recent developments in phage display have yielded many new targeting molecules such as the CHP 26,27. Though the exact mechanism by which CHP interacts with the myocardium is unknown, by conjugating it to exosomes it amplifies the regenerative effects of the exosomes. A limitation of our study is that the mechanisms underlying the regenerative properties of exosomes were not fully elucidated. Nevertheless, recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated pro-angiogenic, pro-myogeneic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory roles of stem cell secretome 77, 78.",
