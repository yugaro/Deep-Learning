The study began in December 2016 and occurred over 2 winter respiratory seasons and 1 intervening nonrespiratory season. Patients were eligible if they were age 1 or older and being evaluated for influenza-like illness (ILI; fever or cough and sore throat) or upper respiratory infection (URI; nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms without fever). Patients were excluded if they were already on antibiotics at the time of ED presentation, not English- or Spanish-speaking, cognitively impaired with no legally authorized representative, or expected to leave before multiplex test results were available. If a patient was deemed eligible for the study, the treating provider was approached by a research team member to confirm that URI or ILI was suspected, and the patient was expected to be present for at least the next 90 minutes. Patients were recruited Monday through Friday between 8 am and 10 pm from rapid care and main adult and pediatric ED areas. Screening was performed under a waiver of informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the UC Davis Institutional Review Board.",

However, these large, multipathogen tests are more expensive than targeted point-of-care tests, and the clinical utility has not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the ED. As a result, some payers are currently moving to limit utilization and reimbursement of large multipathogen panels in favor of targeted influenza and/or RSV testing [9]. This evidence gap in utility and reimbursement uncertainty create challenges for clinicians, laboratories, and hospitals in justifying the cost of instruments and tests, and there is a lack of guidance regarding optimal use. We hypothesized that rapid multirespiratory pathogen testing with results reported during the ED visit could alter treatment in the early phases of patient care and potentially impact patient and health care outcomes.",

            "text": "Thus, we conducted a randomized clinical trial of the FilmArray RP vs usual care in ED patients with signs or symptoms of upper respiratory infection or influenza-like illness. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription. The trial was stopped after 17 months before reaching the prespecified sample size due to dwindling funds and slow enrollment. However, there was a trend toward decreased antibiotic use with RP testing (\u201312% difference; P = .06/0.08, chi-square/Fisher exact test) that was larger in pediatric patients (\u201319% difference; P = .047/0.07) in an age-stratified post hoc analysis, suggesting a potential benefit of increased rapid RP testing in some ED patients. Antiviral prescription (ie, oseltamivir) was not significantly affected despite a 3-fold increase in viral (66% vs 20%) and influenza detections (26% vs 8%), perhaps due to the lack of guidance regarding antiviral use in our study. Other secondary outcomes, such as ED disposition, 30-day return visits, and 30-day deaths, did not differ between groups. Thus, the main effects of rapid RP testing in this study were to increase the proportion of patients with a lab-confirmed viral detection for clinical decision-making by 3-fold and reduce antibiotic prescription by about one-third. It is unknown if similar benefits could be achieved with targeted testing for influenza and/or RSV or antimicrobial stewardship alone. However, it has been suggested that influenza testing alone may be sufficient and cost-effective when applied to outpatients, given that other viruses do not have any specific treatment at this time [9]. Other potential benefits of rapid RP testing, such as infection prevention and patient satisfaction, were not investigated.",

A recent trial in an Argentinian ED found reduced antibiotic and antiviral initiation in patients receiving the FilmArray assay vs standard testing; this study was better powered (432 patients) than our study but may not be generalizable to the United States as empiric treatment without testing is more common in this country [10, 11]. In a retrospective analysis by Rogers et al., the BioFire FilmArray was associated with decreased duration of antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and length of isolation in children admitted to the hospital with ARTI [12]. Future investigations with more targeted use of rapid multiplex testing in the ED could yield more promising results, but additional research is needed to determine which patients would benefit most from testing. For example, Xu et al. showed that the FilmArray could be cost-effective when replacing off-site direct fluorescence antibody testing in pediatric ED patients [13]. A recent randomized controlled trial from the United Kingdom found an increase in patients with short courses of antibiotics and a 1-day reduction in length of stay in patients with rapid RP testing but did not see a difference in the overall proportion of antibiotic treatment compared with the control arm [14]. However, this study was done outside the United States and included patients outside the ED, so the results may not be directly comparable to our study.",

However, the high rate of chest x-ray testing in our study (~70%, both study arms) suggests that providers were at least considering a respiratory illness in most patients but may not have been in the habit of relying on viral testing for their clinical decision-making.",

It is likely that a thoughtful and comprehensive stewardship program around rapid diagnostics could be required to lead to meaningful changes in outcomes. It is also possible that deploying rapid diagnostic tools would lead to more significant changes if applied to an area that has higher baseline antibiotic prescription rates such as an urgent care setting.",

Although the current test was much faster than the off-site respiratory viral panel used at our facility, it is still not fast enough to match the fast-paced workflow of many EDs. Andrews et al. also encountered problems with TAT in their point-of-care (POC) implementation of the FilmArray [6]. However, these problems were mainly attributed to staff availability to run the test after consenting subjects. The FilmArray itself was reported by them to run in 65 minutes in the POC setting. If the FilmArray could be implemented into the ED as a POC test in a way that would fit seamlessly into ED workflow, the TAT may have been minimized for this assay, and we may have seen more promising results. This was demonstrated in the post hoc analysis by Brendish et al. on their randomized controlled trial in the UK. Significant improvements to outcomes, including antibiotic treatment and duration of antibiotics, were seen in patients with virus-positive RP testing that achieved a TAT of \u22641.6 hours vs those of >1.6 hours [15]. In this regard, it is encouraging to see newer POC nucleic acid amplification tests for influenza and RSV coming to market with shorter TATs, on the order of 10\u201320 minutes [16].",

The recently FDA-cleared BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel will identify a wider range of respiratory bacteria and viruses. Depending on TAT and ability to fit into ED workflow, a test such as this could help reduce diagnostic uncertainty when lower respiratory tract infections are also part of the differential diagnosis. However, detecting more pathogens may not be the answer. As a result of the recent Palmetto GBA decision, Medicare will no longer provide coverage for large (\u22656-target) multiplexed diagnostic viral panels such as the BioFire FilmArray for outpatients unless policy changes in the future [17]. This decision to cover only 3\u20135 respiratory pathogen targets and limit their use to infectious disease clinicians except in the case of urgent care, ED, and inpatient settings highlights the importance of implementation and evaluation of diagnostic tests in the context of a value-based health care system. Simply providing test results without consideration of the behavioral aspects of antimicrobial prescribing may result in lack of clinical utility, when these tests could be beneficial if paired with behavioral economics strategies or as part of a comprehensive stewardship program to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.",

The subjects themselves were selected based on symptoms, rather than a clinical decision to order multiplex testing. This in turn led to a heterogeneous subject population, many of whom might not be expected to benefit from viral testing. Locating a specific target population for rapid multiplex testing in the ED may be necessary for significant differences in outcomes. Finally, during the 2017\u20132018 influenza season, activities were undertaken to reduce inappropriate prescribing for viral respiratory infections in otherwise healthy patients using patient and provider education, provider public commitment to reducing inappropriate antibiotic use, and peer comparison data. Thus, our already low prescribing rate may have been reduced, and this may have compounded our loss of power from underenrollment by decreasing the difference between the RP and usual care groups that we anticipated when we powered the study. We also did not analyze cost-effectiveness, and more research is needed to determine if multiplex testing can be economically feasible in the ED. Finally, it is likely that use of comprehensive stewardship strategies and guidelines could have improved effectiveness beyond simple introduction of rapid diagnostic tests.",

Further evaluation of rapid multiplex testing in the ED could see changes in outcomes if the limitations of this study were addressed.
