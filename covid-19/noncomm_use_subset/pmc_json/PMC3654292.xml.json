Additionally, deposition of complement and immunoglobulin in the perifascicular endothelium can lead to ischemia and muscle atrophy, underlining the importance of humoral immunity (25).

The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia rises from 10% among individuals of all ages to as high as 40% among those aged 50 years and older (40). A large prospective study identified four independent predictors of postherpetic neuralgia: older age, severe, acute pain, severe rash and a shorter duration of rash before consultation (41).
