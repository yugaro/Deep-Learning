One exception is the outbreak of COVID-19 that developed aboard the Diamond Princess Ship which was detected in early February when one of its passengers, a traveler from Hong Kong, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The number of cases in the Diamond Princess Ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by February 18, 2020. In contrast, the total number of cases in Singapore, one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases after China, was only 77 at the time (WHO, 2019).",

However, following the implementation of the quarantine period, the overall Rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage, but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold, which likely prolonged the outbreak.",

The rapid increase in the overall Rt from day 12 (January 31, 2020) to day 19 (February 7, 2020) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission, and this time period covers the time lag between February 1, 2020 when the index COVID-19 case was reported and February 5, 2020 when the Japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of COVID-19 positive cases (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020; Kumamotonichinichishinb, 2020). Upon the implementation of the quarantine orders, the overall Rt and Rt for passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Ship declined thereafter, while Rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak (February 13, 2020). This is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates. Indeed, the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7% (1/15) on February 6, 43% (3/7) on February 10, 2020 to 100% (1/1) on February 14, 2020 (National Instatitute of Infectious Disease, 2020). Thus, a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases. Indeed, despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection, crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers. The distribution of the median Re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent (Fig. 3). Because one quarantine officer, one nurse, and one administrative officer contracted COVID-19 aboard the Diamond Princess Ship, the infection risk continued to be significant inside the Diamond Princess Ship.",

Although the high proportion of unavailable data (34% (103/300)) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential, our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of COVID-19 inside confined settings. Second, it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number. In fact, the US government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the American passengers on board the Diamond Princess Ship, and after the disembarkation process, a total of 14 American passengers tested positive for the disease (The New York TImes, 2020) on February 16, 2020.
