It is a strength that bacteria and viruses were identified both in wheezy episodes and in cases of clinical pneumonia. The doctors at the clinic distinguished clinical pneumonia from wheezy episodes on the basis of the presence of tachypnoea, fever, and crepitation on auscultation without wheeze in accordance with standard operating procedures. This is traditional clinical semantics building on scarce evidence, but we know of no better distinction.
