            "text": "In contrast to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was introduced into the human population through a single or a limited number of spill-over event(s) [4], [5], current epidemiological studies suggest that there have been multiple introductions of different MERS-CoV strains into human population from animal reservoir(s) [6]. For SARS-CoV, there is now increasing evidence indicating that it is a bat-borne virus transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts such as palm civets and raccoon dogs [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. For MERS-CoV, the natural reservoir host(s) has not yet been determined, nor how different strains of the virus have been transmitted to human populations on multiple occasions since its first discovery in 2012 [6]. Although there are reports of MERS-like CoVs in different bats around the world, discovery of closely related viruses and virus-neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels has led to the hypothesis that they are likely to be the major reservoir of MERS-CoV and camel-to-human transmission is the main route of spill-over events [6]. However, it is presently not clear whether MERS-CoV was introduced into the camel populations recently or whether it has adapted to camels as a natural reservoir from ancient times. A retrospective search for MERS-CoV antibodies indicated that the virus was circulating among the camel populations in the Middle East and Africa as early as 1992 and 1983, respectively [12], [13], [14], [15]. In a recent study, the detection of a MERS-CoV conspecific virus from an African bat suggests that the MERS-CoV may have originated from an African bat, followed by bat-to-camel transmission in Africa, then the introduction of MERS-CoV to the Middle East through camel exportation/importation [6], [16].",

Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) were introduced into Australia from the mid-19th century to assist with exploration and development of the arid centre of the continent [17]. Between 1840 and 1907 many thousands of camels were imported into Australia, into an area ranging from Central Australia to the De Grey River in Western Australia. As rail services extended north to Alice Springs in Central Australia in 1929, and with the subsequent growth of motor transport, many working camels were turned loose and their feral progeny were able to survive and breed in the desert.",

In 1966, the population was estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000, and by the mid-1980s the estimate increased to a minimum population of 43,000 [18]. By 2008, the minimum population was re-estimated to be about 1 million animals [19], and there was increasing concern of the economic, social and environmental damage the uncontrolled population was causing [20]. In response, plans have been adopted for population control, including a large culling operation between 2010 and 2014, when over 150,000 camels were killed [21]. Currently Australia has the largest herd of camels anywhere in the world, and the only population of wild camels. Long-term sustainable control measures to permanently maintain a lower population density are focused on developing a viable commercialisation, particularly based on mustering to process meat for human consumption for the export market.",

Recombinant CoV N proteins were produced in E. coli and purified directly from SDS-PAGE gels as previously described [23]. For coating onto Luminex beads, a total of 100 \u03bcg each of the two N proteins were coupled onto 100 \u03bcl of bead set 28 (SARS-CoV) and bead set 34 (MERS-CoV), respectively. Briefly, coupled microsphere sets were vortexed and sonicated prior to dilution in PBS-T containing 2% skim milk and transferred to 96-well plate. The diluent was removed using an automated magnetic vacuum manifold followed by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of camel sera diluted 1:100 in PBS-T and incubated, shaking for 30 min at room temperature. Positive control camel sera used in this assay were derived from the natural infection of dromedary camels in Egypt during 2013 as part of a seroepidemiology study [24]. The serum was removed and the plate was washed twice with PBS-T followed by addition of Biotinylated Protein A (Pierce, Rockford, USA) and Protein G (Pierce, Rockford, USA) conjugates and incubated as described above. The conjugate was removed and the beads washed twice with PBS-T followed by addition of Streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin (Qiagen Pty Ltd, Australia) and a final incubation as described above. Assays were performed on a Bio-Plex Protein Array System integrated with Bio-Plex Manager Software (v 6.0) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA).

Furthermore, genetic studies have shown little genetic diversity in the Australian camel population, indicative of a strong \u201cfounder effect\u201d [31], which suggests that the introductions were sourced from a restricted area.

Even if they did, it is possible that it was extinguished during the sea voyage. Alternatively, if the virus did manage to infect the Australian camel population, it is also plausible that it failed to establish long term sustained transmission due to the low population density of the camels when they were released into central Australia in the 1920s. Nevertheless, we propose that a careful collation of all the virological and ecological evidence will enable a reasoned assessment of the most probable status of the ancestors of the feral camels at the time of importation. Specifically, we suggest that investigations in Pakistan (as well as neighbouring Afghanistan and Iran) will provide an important piece of evidence, as to date there have not been any published reports of the MERS-CoV sero-status of these camel populations. Following on from this, if sampling in these countries show that MERS-CoV is not present in the current population, then the most probable explanation is that the virus was unlikely to have ever been introduced into Australia. By contrast, if the virus is found to be present, genetic studies of the virus may be able to partially resolve when it entered into the population, and thus if the camels exported to Australia might have been infected.",

To date the geographical origin of MERS-CoV is controversial, as although the disease is largely confined to the Arabian Peninsula, examination of stored serum collected in Sudan and Somalia from 1983 to 1984 has showed very high seropositivity for MERS-CoV [32]. As MERS-CoV has now been shown to be widespread throughout camel populations in northern, western and eastern Africa [33], there exists a plausible bat reservoir for a MERS-CoV ancestor [16], and there is a large export of camels from eastern Africa into the Arabian Peninsula [34], then a current working hypothesis is that Africa is the original source of the virus within camel populations. However, as other regional sources of the virus have not been investigated, the true geographical spread of the virus is not determined with certainty. Thus, a finding of an absence of MERS-CoV in the populations of camels in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Australia would support the hypothesis that camels are not the original reservoir host of the MERS-CoV virus, and that a spillover event from a bat species into the camel population happened in relatively recent time.",

As it is related to the species (Taphozous perforatus) from which a sequence almost identical to that of the index case of MERS-CoV was isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [36], T. hilli would seem to be the priority for virological sampling. However, the sequence obtained from T. perfortatus was a single, short sequence (203 nucleotides), has not been independently confirmed and no actual isolate has subsequently been obtained [6]. By contrast, a virus from a species which occurs throughout east and southern Africa (Neoromicia capensis) has yielded a full genome sequence, which despite having less identity with MERS-CoV and not occurring in the Arabian Peninsula, is considered a more plausible natural reservoir [6]. As this species occurs within the family Vestpertilionidae, from which the majority of the lineage C \u03b2-CoV isolates have been obtained (Table 3), it is recommended that virological sampling of the Australian Vestpertilionidae species which occur to the north of the current camel distribution (Fig. 2) also be undertaken. With the recent advance of multiple serological profiling tools using a synthetic virome epitope library [37], it is theoretically feasible to examine total infection profiles of both bats and camels in the overlapped geographical locations. Such inter-species serological comparison will undoubtedly shed new light on the real risk and occurrence of spill-over events happening between these two groups of wildlife animals.",

While such active surveillance has a role in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), it has obvious limitations in that it can only occur after the disease has emerged. Furthermore, there are challenges with diagnostics and the difficulty and expense of surveying for diseases of low prevalence, which is the situation for many EIDs in their initial stages. An approach which is gaining increasing recognition in the EID sciences is the use of \u201cproactive surveillance\u201d whereby potential \u201chotspots\u201d for emergence and/or \u201creservoirs\u201d are selected for surveys. We have provided an example of this \u201cnew\u201d type of surveillance whereby we were able to recommend specific bat species to proactively target for sampling, and propose that this is particularly appropriate within the \u201cOne Health\u201d approach to emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "At a first glance, it might seem that assessing the sero-status of feral camels, and the presence of CoVs in bats with potential contact with these camels has little relevance to understanding the epidemiology and evolution of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula. However, such are the complexities of the virus and the disease that many key discoveries have been made by examining animals at the margin of the problem areas. The initial discovery that camels might be the principal reservoir of MERS-CoV arose following exploratory testing of camel serum collected from the Canary Islands, which then led onto a more systematic survey of camels from the Arabian Peninsula [38]. Similarly, the discovery of a plausible ancestor virus to MERS-CoV arose from the sampling of a bat species in South Africa, even though the species does not occur within the Arabian Peninsula [16], [39]. The important lesson from these examples is that when dealing with an emerging infectious disease with a complex epidemiology, conventional outbreak investigations may not resolve key questions, and thus there is a need for studies which might appear tangential. Some of these, as in the examples cited, might result in important discoveries, but it needs to be accepted that most will not. However, we argue that within the context of \u201cproactive surveillance\u201d, then negative survey results can be immensely important in directing attention to where effort is needed, which in our example, is our recommendation for a follow-on sero-survey of camels in western Asia.",
