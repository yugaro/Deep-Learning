Potentially, we can no longer rely on waterfowl to be the only source of new flu variants, as bats have now been found to harbor influenza viruses whose internal genes share common ancestry with all known influenza A viruses.1 Other genome portions share even older ancestry,2 while the main surface protein lies within the known diversity of \u2018usual' influenza A viruses. The appearance of such a vast mixture of genes suggests that more undiscovered flu strains are lurking in bats.",

            "text": "For any virus, the identification of a mammalian reservoir is highly relevant because the \u2018fitness valley' that viruses need to cross for the conquest of new hosts is shallow if the hosts are genetically related.3 Our knowledge of mammalian viruses is fairly opportunistic, focusing on agents of obvious disease in livestock and pets. The range of viruses carried unnoticed by our phylogenetic next of kin may be huge. For instance, wild small mammals including bats and rodents have now been shown to harbor a tremendous spectrum of relatives of human paramyxoviruses\u2014a family that contains the mumps virus, several different respiratory agents and the measles virus.4 Not all of these have yet been proven to have their cognates in bats, but the sample studied so far is just a tiny fraction of the tremendous bat diversity. Some of these agents have already been suggested to cross-infect humans.5 That is a worrying perspective because the concept of liberating humankind from some of its most notorious viruses by mass vaccination is essentially dependent on the absence of animal sources from which eradicated viruses could be replenished.6 The implications of recent findings might even reach into the future agenda of virus eradication: the hepatitis C virus, one of the most important human viruses and a prime candidate for eradication pending vaccine availability, has relatives in companion animals including dogs and horses.7,8",

On the contrary, candidates for the next pandemic would be agents that are transmitted efficiently and cause acute disease\u2014such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and flu.

Their association with pathogenic viruses has been proposed to be due to specific immune functions,12 but these remain to be proven. Large social group sizes and a migratory lifestyle may suffice to make certain bat species become breeders of viruses. The reliance of bat-borne viruses on transmissibility rather than persistence could explain their high onward transmissibility after host-switching.13 There are prominent examples of bat-borne viruses that can be passed between humans, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome agent. For comparison, we have few examples of rodent-derived viruses that are routinely passed from human to human. Lassa virus may be the only relevant exception, and even there, transmission seems to be possible only under conditions of very close contact.",

The idea that reservoir-borne viruses should exist peacefully with their hosts is most likely not widely valid.13 As we dig deeper into viral reservoir ecology, including its man-made modifications, we may find that changes in host populations affect the transmission and maintenance of viruses with possible consequences for their potential to infect humans (Figure 1). For example, analogously to the dilution effect theory, one could expect that either the reduction or expansion of the host group density would allow more virulent virus variants. Obviously, the investigations necessary to probe such effects need to be led by ecologists rather than virus hunters.",

The maintenance of non-persisting viruses requires a sufficient rate of transmission (x-axis) within the host population or group. A longer duration of excretion or infectivity (y-axis) allows for a lower virus transmission rate while still successfully maintaining the virus. Increased transmission correlates with increased replication and virulence. As virulence kills or incapacitates hosts, it limits the duration of infectivity, leaving a limited space in which maintenance can be optimized (triangle). The optimum is virus-specific (gray curve). Changes in host ecology can move the maintenance optimum within the limits of the optimization space (dashed curve). Those viruses whose maintenance optimum is moved into the red area of the optimization space may pose increased pandemic risks.",
