However, it is not only different cities that can have completely diverse standards of infrastructure and social security. The same city can provide very varying conditions for their residents. Living in the slums compared to more wealthy neighbourhoods, will expose the inhabitants to different risks. Traditionally cities can offer many advantages compared to rural settings, but under certain circumstances they can rather be a health hazard. The rapid migrations of people to cities can lead to overcrowding, which can generate slums or shanty towns. These slums are characterized by poor housing, lack of fresh water, and bad sanitation facilities (2). All of these shortages can be a threat to the residents\u2019 health and be a possible breeding ground for infectious diseases. The location of slums are often outside of the city centres, in more hazardous locations and the population feels a lack of social and economic opportunities compared with other residents. In sub-Saharan Africa, 62% of the urban population in 2012 lived in shanty towns (2). For example, in 2009, 96% of the urban population in Central African Republic lived in these slums (6). In Kenya's capital Nairobi, 60% of the population lives in slums, and child mortality there is 2.5 times greater than other parts of the city (9). The community and health care services have great challenges to provide the entire population with equal and adequate service. The collected parties need to be aware of the differences in threats with respect to infectious diseases, both at the local and governmental levels.",

Infections have been linked to slums in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with high population density and low income (10). In several other countries, cholera incidence is the highest in urban regions with high population density (11, 12). Differences in prevalence of asymptomatic carriers of antimicrobial drug-resistant diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli have also been found in Brazil between slum settlements and more wealthy parts of the community 13). The poor infrastructure in the slum can be a barrier for improvement, but at the same time targeted interventions for safer water and better sanitation facilities could potentially have a profound effect of the overall health.",

            "text": "Overcrowded housing in high-density populations in the slums can be a breeding ground for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The rate of tuberculosis has traditionally been higher in urban centres compared to rural (14, 15). Studies in slum settlements in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, indicate a high prevalence of tuberculosis, which was almost twice as high compared to the overall national average and four times higher than the overall urban levels (16. However, different patterns can be seen in different countries; for example, in Poland the rates of tuberculosis have shown only slightly lower incidence in rural population compared to urban, 21.9 per 100,000 versus 22.4 per 100,000 respectively (17). Tuberculosis in the United States has declined in the twentieth century, and several factors such as improved nutrition status, socioeconomic status, overall public health, and new drug regimens have been thought to play a major role. However, in the mid-1980s a resurgence occurred which reached its peak in 1992, especially in urban areas among the homeless and incarcerated population (18). The knowledge regarding symptoms, transmission, and prevention has been shown to be greater among the urban population in Pakistan's Punjab province compared to the rural population. Health-seeking behaviour was also better among the urban population, in the aspect of when to seek medical advice for early diagnosis and potential treatment (19). Information about infectious diseases and how they spread in the community can help the individuals to protect themselves, but knowledge about the slums and the infectious diseases panorama is also crucial for local physicians. They need to know how to look for the correct diagnosis, even if their diagnostic tools might be limited. The right hypothesis from the start in these cases is even more important.",

In this group, 90% live in rural areas, but the actual amount of residents from urban settings is gradually increasing. Between 1990 and 2012, the group in urban settings which lacked sanitation actually significantly increased from 215 million to 756 million, which could be explained by population growth (20).

These infections are among the most important causes of physical and intellectual growth retardation in the world and have a major impact on public health (22). Good hygiene practices and good sanitary conditions have lowered the prevalent levels of contamination. In the Brazilian city of Salvador, with a population of 2.5 million, an improvement of sewerage coverage from 26 to 80% of the households led to an estimated overall reduction of diarrhoeal diseases of 22% (23). Neglected tropical diseases can cause substantial health problems in developing countries, and some of these diseases have a faecal-oral transmission pathway. Examples of such diseases could be schistosomiasis, trachoma, and soil-transmitted helminthiases. Improved sanitation could contribute to a significant improvement for the public health. In many countries, however, the focus is on treatment by medication and not improved sanitation. The reason could be that it would be much more expensive to carry out the necessary infrastructural improvements (24). Safe drinking water and proper sanitary facilities must be taken into account in city planning. Factors like this can potentially have a profound positive effect in lowering infectious diseases with a faecal\u2013oral route.

Chagas disease affects an estimated 8 million people every year, and is an important health challenge in Latin America. In recent decades, progress has been made to reduce the burden of disease, by vector control, screening blood donors, improved housing, and epidemiological surveillance. Chagas disease is a growing health problem in non-endemic areas because of population movements (26). It is estimated that 300,000 individuals in the United States are infected (27) and the most affected country in Europe, Spain, is thought to have 45,000\u201367,000 cases (28). The example of Chagas disease shows that physicians who practice in countries where the disease is not present must be aware of the travel history of the patient to connect the potential symptoms to the correct diagnosis.",

New York City has one of the largest populations of rats in the United States. It has been shown that encounters between rats and humans have been linked to proximity to open public spaces and subway lines, the presence of vacant housing units, and low education of the population (30). Information like this can be useful for health officials when they launch specific control initiatives. The changes in human population with increased urbanization and urban poverty has also altered our perception of some zoonoses linked to the rat population. Leptospirosis has traditionally been perceived as a primarily rural disease, but the incidence in urban centres is increasing (31, 32). In Chinese cities, the incidence of Seoul hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome has been linked to urban growth, growing rat population, and increase rat\u2013human contact (33).

LF still has its major impact in rural settings, but the increasing urbanization in the developing world has made LF an infectious disease that also has to be considered elsewhere. One of the parasite species Wuchereria bancrofti has been located in many urban areas and has the potential for transmission in this environment. Moreover, one of the vectors for the parasite is the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, which thrives in these surroundings, especially in overcrowded areas with poor sanitary and draining facilities. However, within one city the transmission can vary substantially depending on the standard of the sanitary conditions. The mosquito vector Culex spp. can be found in large parts of Central and South America, East Africa, and Asia (36).",

Dengue is on WHO's list of neglected tropical diseases, and is on the rise worldwide. The number of infections has drastically increased in the tropical regions of the world in the last 40 years. Recent studies have estimated 390 million cases each year, and the burden is the highest in India with one-third of all the new infections (37). Several factors have played a big role in the escalation, such as urbanization, globalization, and lack of mosquito control. Aedes aegypti lay their eggs in artificial water containers made by humans, which is a key component in the urban transmission cycle. The adaption of dengue through its vector has made dengue an infectious disease on the clear rise (38). Thailand is a country with all four serotypes of dengue virus, and the epidemics of dengue haemorrhagic fever have shown a possible correlation to originate from the urban capital of Bangkok and then spread geographically in an outward manner to more rural settlements and provinces. A model to understand this mechanism could lead to more effective use of the health systems in the affected areas (39). Dengue has become a global problem and is no longer restricted to the developing world. Despite better knowledge, it seems tough to control the vector, which has adapted to the urban environment and living close to people. An efficient vaccine is not yet commercially available, but could be a powerful factor in the fight against the global dengue epidemic.",

However, for a successful transmission cycle WNV also need the American robin (Turdus migratorius), which has several broods per season and hatchlings are more susceptible to WNV infection than adult birds (40). The county of Dallas, Texas, experienced an epidemic of WNV infections in 2012. Surveillance reports revealed 25% of the cases in the United States were found in Dallas County (41).

The disease was first recognized in wildlife markets in Guandong, China. Investigations have found this SCoV from the Himalayan palm civets in live-animal markets in the region. The first cases of SARS reportedly occurred in individuals who handled these animals to prepare exotic food, and the virus is thought to have crossed over to their human host (47). SARS could then spread throughout the world by, for example, international travel. It spread in urban dwellings in large cities and in well-equipped city hospitals. Public fear of travelling led to considerable economic losses that affected entire countries (48). The example of SARS shows that food markets in southern China can be the origin of a worldwide health crisis. Travel routes around the world have connected the urban world and large megacities like never before. Accordingly it is important to take necessary preventive measures before the epidemic gets out of control, and here big organizations like WHO, but also governments, play an important role.

The hub of the epidemic has been the three countries in Western Africa: Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. It all began in December 2013 in Guinea, in the providence of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, in the eastern rainforest region. The disease transmission in the capital of Conakry is thought to be the first major urban setting for EVD (57). WHO was first notified of the EVD outbreak in March 2014, and on August 8, the WHO declared the current situation as \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019 (58). Before, EVD outbreaks in central Africa had been limited in size and geographical spread to a few hundred persons, mostly in remote areas and not large urban settings (59). The centre of the epidemic (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) has, as many of their neighbouring countries, a large population living in rural settings; only 36, 49, and 40% of their population live in urban centres (60\u201362). The population is, however, highly interconnected in these countries with travel and cross-border traffic, with good road access between rural and urban settings. These communications have made the magnitude of the EVD epidemic possible. Despite cases of EVD in Nigeria and Lagos, a megacity with 20 million inhabitants, the transmission has been limited, which proves that implementation of control measures can limit the transmission (63). The mortality rate has been high in previous outbreaks, up to 90% (64). The fatality rate in the West Africa epidemic has been estimated to around 70% for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone when data for patients with recorded definitive clinical outcomes (63). This unprecedented epidemic points out the importance of better surveillance, understanding, and preventions measures for this potentially deadly virus. Ebola virus (EBOV) is thought to be a zoonotic disease, and fruit bats are under investigation to be the natural reservoir. EBOV sequences have been found in these animals near the human outbreaks which implies where the virus might originate from (65, 66). Closer contact with humans and fruit bats are thus risks for a new global health crisis and the severity of an Ebola epidemic has already been witnessed. The high costs, both from an economic and overall health perspective, have affected entire countries and have even cost lives on the other side of the earth.",

WHO estimates 198 million cases (124\u2013283 million) of malaria and 584,000 deaths (367,000\u2013755,000) in 2013. The highest mortality rates have been shown to be closely linked to poor countries with a low gross national income (GNI) per capita (67). Estimations have been made that nearly 25% of the total African population, 200 million, currently live in urban settings where malaria transmission is a reality. The annual incidence is estimated at 24.8\u2013103.2 million cases of clinical malaria among the urban population in Africa (68). The relationship between the malaria mosquito vector and the human host determines the burden of morbidity and mortality. This interface is dependent on many different factors and the degree of urbanization is an important one. A significant reduction in malaria transmission has been observed over the last century. Increased urbanization and decreased transmission have correlated in several different studies (69). However, whether it was the increased urbanization that led to a reduction in transmission or the malaria reduction that led to development that promoted urbanization of societies is a challenge to determine (70). A clear connection has been shown between reduced transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and urbanization; however, for Plasmodium vivax it is less obvious. For P. vivax, a connection has been found globally and in Asia and Africa; inconsistent results, however, were found in the Americas. Several possibilities could explain these incoherent results, such as more widespread transmission of P. vivax, lower transmission intensity, the wide distribution in Asia, and high prevalence of Duffy negativity in Africa, which protects against P. vivax\n(71). The overall decrease of the burden of malaria has been a positive effect of urbanization, but the exact mechanisms are not yet known. However, it seems that urbanization can have a favourable influence.",

Coverage of measles vaccination in Indonesia have shown to be 68.5% in rural areas, compared with 80.1% in urban regions (72). Studies in Nigeria have shown that sometimes the coverage can actually be better in more rural areas, and it might be explained by better mobilization and participation in the delivery of immunization services (73). In a study in Uganda, 58% of the urban group compared to 53% in the rural areas were fully immunized, but polio vaccine was given to 51% in the urban group and 52% in the rural group (74). Immunization coverage can also vary considerably among different settings, not only between rural and urban surroundings, but also between urban, rural, and slum settlements. In Changdigarh, a union territory of India, full immunization of children at the age of 2 was 30% in slums, 74% in urban, and 62.5% in rural settings (75). It shows that there can be a wide variety of reasons for immunization status among the population in different regions and countries of the world. Effective immunization can be a cost-effective measure in poorer countries. High coverage can prevent epidemics in large cities and save many lives; however, immunization needs to be available both for the rural and urban population to achieve the greatest benefit.",

Laboratories in rural areas are often poorly equipped and cannot always diagnose certain zoonotic diseases, which could limit the doctors\u2019 capability for correct diagnosis and treatment (76). Public knowledge about certain infectious diseases can also vary depending on many different factors. The knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) among Bangladeshi adolescents was higher among people in urban areas compared to rural, both in general and HIV and AIDS (77). The same results about HIV and AIDS have been found among a Canadian population (78). Studies in Chengdu and Shanghai, China, have shown risk perception about STIs and HIV and AIDS is profoundly changed in rural-to-urban migrants (79, 80). The same result has been shown in a study among rural-to-urban migrants in Ethiopia 81). The rapid influx of migrants moving to cities makes it hard to get adequate information to all the different groups in the society. To educate the public is one of the many challenges for local governments and health officials.",

The capacity for surveillance, control programs, prevention, and public knowledge programs is far better in cities. It is here where the resources and political and financial power are gathered.
