It contains 397 amino acids, and has a theoretical molecular mass of 45 kDa. VP6, which is the most conserved, immunogenic, and abundant rotavirus protein, is extremely stable, and spontaneously forms trimers that, depending on pH and ionic strength, can self-assemble to form nanostructures, such as spheres or NTs.5 Many rotavirus strains are characterized by conserved VP6 epitopes, and thus this antigen is considered the major diagnostic marker for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.6",

Briefly, this method involved centrifugation of samples at 4,000 g for 30 minutes before mixing supernatant with the lysis buffer. The extracted RNA was denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5 minutes. A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit as previously described by Ushijima et al.24 A 1,194-base pair fragment of the VP6 gene was amplified with the forward primer VP6-for (5\u2032-ATG GAG GTT CTG TAT TCA TTG TCA-3\u2032; nucleotides 1\u201324) and the reverse primer VP6-rev (5\u2032-TCA CTT AAT CAA CAT GCT TCT GAT-3\u2032; nucleotides 1,170\u20131,194). The reaction was carried out with an initial RT step at 45\u00b0C for 30 minutes, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 35 cycles of amplification (60 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 60 seconds at 54\u00b0C, and 1 minute, 30 seconds at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension of 7 minutes at 72\u00b0C in a GeneAmp\u00ae PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

In Figure 5B, a zoom of a single particle is shown to appreciate the morphology and the geometry of this VLP. In Figure 5C, the results obtained at pH 6 are shown. In this case, elongated structures that are a few micron in length and with a lateral dimension in the order of 40\u2013100 nm may be indicative of the formation of NTs, as reported by Lepault et al at this pH value.5 Finally, in Figure 5D, the TEM image of the sample at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 200 mM CaCl2 shows a condition disfavoring the formation of ordered structures, both VLPs and NTs.

A prerequisite for the success of this method is the possibility of obtaining the viral protein in large amounts and with a high degree of purity. The main result of the present work was the definition, step by step, of a fast and highly reproducible protocol to obtain a large quantity of VP6. This protein is able to self-assemble at two different pH values, 6 and 4.5, forming NTs or VLPs, as previously demonstrated.5 Comparing the particle shape obtained by means of TEM and AFM measurements, we also provide promising evidence of the flexibility and the consequent shape remodeling of VP6.",

An evident difference in the macroscopic properties, which are varied according to the 3-D organization, is reported in this work. Indeed, the potential of protein NTs to induce strong immune responses and an adjuvant effect has been demonstrated by others.8,34,35 Immunogenicity of tubular structures is strongly linked to the exclusive framework organization. Epitopes displayed may be differentially more spaced out than in spherical particles36 with a higher expression ratio, thus affecting IgG and IgA response.37 Furthermore, tubular structures administered to mice may have longer circulation times than spherical particles. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of their physicochemical properties may be helpful to obtain the best compromise between stability and immunogenicity. We point out that a better understanding of VLP mechanics may be relevant to understanding virus biology. Indeed, mechanical features of virus capsids have evolved by natural selection for as long as relevant adaptive features involving interaction forces between cells and biomolecules have developed.38",
