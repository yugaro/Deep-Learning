            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by severe pulmonary vascular\ndysfunction characterized by acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia associated with\nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and systemic inflammation. Although the exact\npathophysiologic mechanism causing pulmonary vascular dysfunction has not been determined\nyet, it is a circulatory dysfunction often associated with moderate thrombocytopenia1\u20133 and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).4\u20136 Because its pathogenetic mechanism is not clearly recognized, no effective\ntherapeutic agent targeting the underlying pathologic disease has been procured to date.\nVentilator support, fluid and electrolyte balances, and cardiopulmonary monitoring with the\nbest supportive care have marginally improved the outcome of ARDS in several decades.\nMortality rate is still very high. It increases with disease severity. In a multicenter,\ninternational, prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, unadjusted hospital\nmortality was reported to be 35% among those with mild ARDS, 40% for those with moderate\ndisease, and 46% for patients with severe ARDS.7\n",

In endotheliopathy,\nthe pathologic nature of inflammation promoting inflammatory response12 is recognized and the character of \u201cmicrothrombi\u201d leading to multiple hematologic\nphenotypes is identified.9 In addition, the true mechanism of in vivo hemostasis in vascular injury and three\ndifferent thrombogenetic mechanisms within hemostasis are uncovered.8,10 Through the recognition of endothelial molecular pathogenesis, enough evidences have\nbeen accumulated that ARDS is one of the phenotypes of MODS occurring as a result of\ndisseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology\ncontributing to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD).1,9\u201311\n",

The platelet consumption occurs when ULVWF released from\nendotheliopathy recruit platelets to form platelet-ULVWF complexes,1,9,12 which become microthrombi strings and platelets are consumed. This concept of\nTCIP is direct and unequivocal evidence that endotheliopathy promotes in vivo\nhemostasis. Thrombocytopenia in critically ill patient usually presents with mild to\nmoderately decreased platelet count, and bleeding has not been a significant issue in\nthe care of critically ill patients. According to hemostatic principles (Table 3), blood vessel damage\nlimited to ECs in endotheliopathy activates ULVWF path, but TF path is not activated if\nsubendothelial tissue (SET)/extravascular tissue (EVT) illustrated in Figure 2 is not compromised.8,10,12 As the hemostatic nature of microthrombosis associated with critical illnesses\nhas not been recognized to date, TCIP has been benignly neglected although Bone et al22 in late 70s had observed thrombocytopenia was a significant component when he\ndescribed thrombocytopenia in ARDS. Now, TCIP is found to be consumptive\nthrombocytopenia caused by microthrombogenesis that leads to EA-VMTD/DIT.9\n",

In the study, multiple pulmonary artery filling defects were detected, which\nfindings were interpreted to be consistent with vascular microthrombosis. However, the\nconcept of microthrombosis was not defined yet in coagulation community. Nonetheless,\nthe thesis of microvascular thrombosis or vascular microthrombosis can explain the\ncompromised vascular circulatory function of the lungs and occlusive lesions in\npulmonary angiography better than any of other propositions. Proposed theories for the\npathogenesis of ARDS have included pulmonary vascular endothelial injury leading to\nendothelial dysfunction due to inflammatory cytokines or activated immune cells,63 upregulation of adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1\nand E-selectin, underexpression of vascular endothelial cadherins,64,65 interactions between neutrophils and cytokines promoting transendothelial\nmigration of cytokine-primed neutrophils,66 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provoking coagulation and\nmicrocirculatory failure.67\u201369 However, these theories could not define how and what molecular changes occur to\nlead to ARDS and produce increased capillary permeability that was considered to be the\nhallmark of ARDS.70 More importantly, these theories cannot answer why inflammation in ARDS is\nfrequently associated with simultaneous hematologic syndromes and MODS.5,71,72\n",

In\naddition to common association of ARDS and MODS, the similar, if not the same, pulmonary\npathologic changes from different pathogens and noninfectious critical illnesses support\nthe mechanism that each of clinical phenotypes of MODS occurs as a result of the same\nsystemic disease of VMTD,12 as displayed in Figure 3.\nFor example, similar to the organ phenotype of hemolytic uremic syndrme (HUS) in the\nkidneys, the organ phenotype of ARDS in the lungs is caused by microvascular thrombosis,\nwhich is also characteristic of TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \u201cDIC,\u201d and thrombotic\nmicroangiopathy. In this context, it can be concluded that ARDS, HUS, and every organ\nsyndrome in MODS are also the manifestations of EA-VMTD/DIT, as illustrated in Figure 1 and further elaborated in\nFigure 3.

Hemostasis stops bleeding in external bodily injury but\nproduce thrombosis in intravascular injury. In the different level (depth) of\nintravascular injury as presented in Tables 3 and 4, different paths of thrombogenesis take place\ndepending upon what component(s) of vascular wall is damaged (Figure 2). If the intravascular damage is confined\nto the ECs (level 1), lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis (ie,\nVMTD such as TIA, TTP-like syndrome, ARDS, and MODS) because TF path is not activated.\nOn the other hand, if the intravascular damage extends from the ECs to SET (level 2),\nboth ULVWF path and TF path become activated and cause macrothrombosis (eg, DVT; acute\nischemic stroke) as illustrated in hemostatic theory (Figure 4A and B).10,12 In addition, if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including\nSET and EVT (level 3), both ULVWF path and TF path become activated and form\nmacrothrombosis with additional EVT bleeding (eg, thrombohemorrhagic stroke), which is\nsummarized in Tables 3 and\n4. For example, for\nstroke, this concept is very important in the understanding of thrombogenesis, not only\nin making the diagnosis but also in planning for the treatment. Also, in another\nsituation, if the ECs, SET- and EVT are damaged by obtuse external trauma, bleeding\noccur into EVT in smaller vessels, but without bleeding into the damaged vascular lumen.\nTissue factor is released and mixed with blood in EVT to activate FVII to trigger the\nactivation of TF/VII path. It causes only \u201chematoma\u201d without significantly breached ECs\nbecause ULVWF path is not activated. This logic is based on \u201ctwo-path unifying theory.\u201d\nPlease see Figure 4B, showing\nthree different thrombogenetic processes: microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, and\nmacrothrombogenesis, which are annotated in bold/shaded face. Each thrombogenesis occurs\nwhen ULVWF path, TF path, or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels\n(depth) of damage in intravascular injury. The characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots,\nand macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinctly\ndifferent clinical thrombotic disorders.10 Among these characters, ARDS is a hemostatic disease made of \u201cmicrothrombi\nstrings.\u201d",

The underlying pathologic nature of ARDS is a\nhemostatic disease due to endotheliopathy that promotes activation of two molecular\npathways. One is inflammatory pathway, which releases cytokines and provokes\ninflammation, including fever, malaise, and myalgia. The other is microthrombotic\npathway, which causes exocytosis of ULVWF and platelet activation and triggers much\nmore deadly DIT via microthrombogenesis, leading to EAVMTD/DIT. Disseminated\nintravascular thrombosis orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and\nTTP-like syndrome.

Its histologic components can be\ndivided into the endothelium, tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa, and\neach component has different function contributing to molecular hemostasis.

If the level of intravascular injury is\nconfined to the endothelium, lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes\nmicrothrombosis (ie, EA-VMTD) because TF path is not activated. On the other hand,\nif the level of intravascular injury extends from the endothelium to SET/EVT, TF\npath becomes also activated and causes macrothrombosis (eg, DVT). In another\ntheoretical situation, if only SET/EVT is injured, available TF is supposed to\nactivate lone TF path.

However, this concept cannot explain microthrombi and thrombus\nformation. Therefore, novel \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis was derived\nfrom the vascular physiologic logic of hemostasis based on 5 hemostatic principles\nand 5 essential components participating in hemostasis8 and known works of many dedicated coagulation scientists. Please note that\nthere are 3 different thrombogenetic paths in \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d\n(macrothrombogenesis, microthrombogenesis, and fibrinogenesis) as annotated in bold\nface. Each thrombogenetic path occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, and/or combined\npaths are utilized depending upon the vascular levels of damage in intravascular\ninjury, which include the endothelium, SET, and EVT. The characters of the\nthrombus/blood clot from different paths are unique and produce distinctly different\nclinical thrombotic disorders. The pathogenesis ARDS is via microthrombogenesis due\nto lone activation of ULVWF path, which promotes microthrombi strings made of\nplatelet-ULVWF complexes in pulmonary vasculatures. APL indicates acute\npromyelocytic leukemia; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; DVT, deep vein\nthrombosis; EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease;\nEVT, extravascular tissue; SET, subendothelial tissue; TF, tissue factor; ULVWF,\nunusually large von Willebrand factor multimers.",
