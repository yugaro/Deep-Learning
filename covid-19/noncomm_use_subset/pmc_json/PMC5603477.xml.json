There are 300 million people worldwide affected by asthma.1 The public health burden of asthma has increased over the past 2 decades, and acute exacerbation of asthma is a particularly important and costly problem, because morbidity and mortality due to asthma are closely related to the frequency and severity of the exacerbations.2 Identification of causal factors is vital for prevention and management of exacerbations. In Western countries, viral infections are responsible for up to 80%-85% of exacerbations in childhood asthma.3456 In contrast, viral infections are involved in <50% of asthma exacerbations among adult asthmatics.789101112",

Asthma was previously diagnosed based on the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (GINA report: global strategy for asthma management and prevention 2011 May 4. Available at: http://www.ginasthma.org/uploads/users/files/GINA_Report2011_May4.pdf). All subjects had a clinical diagnosis of asthma supported by at least one of the following criteria: 1) an increase in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of >12% or 200 mL after inhalation of 400 \u00b5g albuterol, 2) a reduction in the FEV1 of 20% in response to a provocative concentration of <10 mg/mL inhaled methacholine (PC20), and 3) an increase in the FEV1 >20% over 14 days after inhaled or systemic corticosteroid use. The subjects underwent a standardized assessment, which included analyses of induced sputum specimens, complete blood cell count with differential counts, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) measurement, chest radiography, body mass index (BMI) measurement, and allergy skin-prick tests at the initial visit. Twenty-four common inhalant allergens, including dust mites (Dermatophagoides farina and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), cat fur, dog fur, cockroaches, grass pollens, tree pollens, ragweed pollens, and Aspergillus species (Bencard Co., Brentford, UK) were used in the skin-prick tests. This study was prospectively performed by including the patients of the Soonchunhyang asthma cohort (n=1,843), and their characteristics were summarized in our previous publication.17 Among them, we recruited those who complained the aggravation of the lower respiratory symptoms and were able to expectorate good quality sputum samples. Exclusion criteria were the presence of parenchymal lung diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, idiopathic interstitial lung diseases, and abnormal lung infiltrations on chest radiography.",

RV URTI and LRTI were frequently associated with asthma exacerbations in child and adult Caucasian asthmatics.14 Nicholson et al.8 reported that 33% of 229 acute exacerbation cases were RV-positive by RT-PCR. A longitudinal study of adult patients reported an RV detection rate of 20% in 30 asthmatics.7 In a study of 42 adult asthmatics hospitalized due to respiratory viral infection, RV was detected in 30% of the subjects by RT-PCR.10 Thus, RV constitutes ~30% of the respiratory viruses related to asthma exacerbations in both Korean and Caucasian adult asthmatics. The prevalence of respiratory viruses differs markedly according to age and geography.13 The frequency of RV detection is significantly lower in adult asthmatics than in child asthmatics.

Thus, because RV was detected in almost half of the stable LRTI cases, the relationship between RV infection and asthma exacerbations seems to be inconsistent: detection of RV in sputum does not always induce an asthma exacerbation. Other studies of adult asthmatics have reported similar results. In an 11 month longitudinal study of 31 atopic asthmatics aged 15\u201356 years, 30 viruses were detected, 18 (60%) of which were associated with asthma exacerbations.7 In these populations, RV was detected in 14/30 (46.6%) asthmatics and 3/9 (33.3%) non-asthmatics. A longitudinal study of adult asthmatics reported that one-third of symptomatic respiratory tract viral infections were not associated with worsening of asthma symptoms.10 In a recent longitudinal cohort study of couples (1 with asthma and 1 without) that evaluated the presence of RV in nasal secretions at 2-week intervals over a 3-month period, the incidence of RV infection was similar in those with asthma and those without (10.1% vs 8.5%).9 In a study of children, the rate of RV isolation was almost identical in those with wheezy bronchitis (28.6%) and those with upper respiratory illness (29.5%).20 These studies and our data suggest that RV is related to both acute exacerbations of asthma and stable LRTI without asthma exacerbations.",

This detection rate is lower than that initially expected. In a 1979 study of children, the detection rate was 26.4%.20 In that study, virus isolation was performed by cell culture.20 In contrast, respiratory viruses can now be identified by virus culture, serology, immunofluorescence antigen detection, and PCR-based tests.13 Since the development of PCR assays in the 1990s, their sensitivity has improved markedly. Thus, our detection rate is relatively low, likely due to inadequate sputum samples. Virus detection is usually performed in the upper airway because collection of sputum from young children and some adult asthmatics is not feasible. In our study, viruses were detected in sputum samples, not in nasopharyngeal washings or swabs. Use of this method may have resulted in the low frequency of RV detection in our study, because RV usually infects the upper respiratory tract.9 However, in our comparison study of sputum and nasal swabs in asthmatics with LRTIs,23 the concordance rate of virus detection was 95.2%, and the detection rate was higher in sputum than in nasal swabs. Thus, use of sputum did not seem to be a cause of the low frequency of RV detection in our study. The second reason is the delayed sampling of sputum in our study. An exacerbation was defined as aggravation of pre-existing symptoms of dyspnea and wheezing within 14 days before the study and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 <80% of the predicted value or the personal best.18 RV has an incubation period of 2 days and is shed for 7 days after development of symptoms.2425 FEV1 decreases significantly after infection, reaching a minimum at 2 days after experimental RV inoculation.26 Because our study was a cross-sectional design, we did not analyze the lag time between the appearance of LRTI symptoms and sputum virus analysis. Therefore, a lag time of >7 days in some patients may have resulted in the low detection rate.",

These data indicate that a subset of patients is susceptible to asthma exacerbation in the presence of viral LRTI. In addition to viruses, asthma exacerbation can be caused by other agents, including allergens (dust mites, pollen, and animal dander),27 occupational exposure (grains, flours, cleaning agents, metals, irritants, and woods), hormones (menstrual asthma), drugs (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and beta-blockers), exercise, stress, smoking exposure,28 and air pollutants.2930 The factors that trigger exacerbations differ among individuals. Thus, exacerbation of asthma may be a result of the complex interplay among respiratory viruses, host airway susceptibility factors, and environmental modifiers. A case-control study of 60 adult patients compared those hospitalized with acute asthma with 2 control groups: patients with stable asthma and patients hospitalized for non-asthma conditions.2 Compared with the controls, a significantly higher proportion of acute asthmatics were both sensitized and exposed to allergens, including dust mites, cat, and dog allergens. Intriguingly, the combination of high exposure to 1 or more allergens and virus detection significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for asthma compared with controls with stable asthma.27 These results indicate synergism among allergen sensitization, exposure to a high level of a sensitizing allergen, and viral infection in inducing asthma deterioration.3132 In our study, the frequency of virus detection was not different between atopics and non-atopics (data not shown). Although all of these factors are expected to predispose asthmatics to viral infections,33 determining whether the exacerbation is due to viral infection or other causes is not feasible at present.",

However, the virus detection rate was ~45% in February and March and <20% in May, July, and August. These data indicate that symptoms of LRTI with asthma exacerbation in early spring may be due mainly to viral infections, and that those in late spring to summer may be due mainly to other environmental factors. In addition, virus prevalence varied markedly: RV was predominant during fall and early winter, while IFV A was predominant during winter. IFV A is the predominant respiratory virus in winter in Korea.35 RSV was predominant during fall, winter and early spring, and PIV was predominant during late spring and early fall. The seasonal variation reported in the present study is in agreement with that previously reported.34",

Virus was detected in approximately one-fifth of the subjects with exacerbated and stable disease. In both states, RV was the most frequently detected virus, followed by IFV A, which is comparable with those of Caucasian studies. Forty-nine patients underwent an examination for viruses during 2 episodes of exacerbation and at the time of each exacerbated and stable episode. The virus detection rate at the second examination was significantly higher in cases with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with sequential exacerbation and stable episodes, suggesting a presence of susceptible asthmatics to exacerbation in case of LTRI. Seasonal variations in detection rates and types of virus show the similar patterns to those of Caucasian asthmatics.",
