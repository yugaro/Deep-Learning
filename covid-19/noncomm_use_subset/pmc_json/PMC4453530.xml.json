CoVs are vertebrate pathogens responsible mainly for respiratory and enteric infections in a wide range of animals and human (2). Among the high diversity of CoVs infecting animal species, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is of special relevance in pigs, causing a life-threatening disease with important economic losses (3). In humans, CoV infections have been historically associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases (4). However, the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (5) and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (6), both causing acute pneumonia and even death, redefined historic perceptions and potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of CoV replication and pathogenesis will allow the development of effective strategies to prevent and control CoV infections.",

Both ORFs are directly translated from the viral genome, resulting in two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), which are autoproteolitically cleaved to release the replication-transcription complex components (8). The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome includes the genes encoding the structural spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as the genus-specific proteins characteristic of each CoV, which are expressed from a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) (2, 7, 8).",

To date, several cellular proteins implicated in CoV replication have been identified on the basis of their interaction with replicase proteins (10, 11) or with cis-acting elements required for viral genome replication (12, 13). Recently, we identified 10 cellular proteins interacting with the TGEV genome ends by RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis (13). These proteins included the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which preferentially interacted with the 5\u2032 end of the genome, and a set of 9 proteins, including several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (A1, A2B1, A0, Q, and U), the translation factors glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS), and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and the p100 transcriptional coactivator, which bound preferentially to the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Silencing studies demonstrated a negative role in viral RNA synthesis for PTB (9) and a positive role for the 3\u2032-end-interacting proteins hnRNP Q, EPRS, RRS, and PABP (13) (S. Marquez-Jurado, L.

This recognition triggers a signaling cascade that culminates with the synthesis of interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines to limit viral replication and spread (16). For RNA viruses, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which are present in the viral genome as stem-loop structures or are generated during viral replication, are the most important pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognized by cellular PRRs (15, 17). In the case of CoVs, MDA5 has been described as the main cytoplasmic PRR sensing the viral RNAs (18).",

In this sense, CoVs encode several proteins that interfere with type-I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine production at different levels (15). Similar to that of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, CoV replication takes place in the cytoplasm, leading to the generation of dsRNA molecules that trigger the host antiviral innate immune response. To overcome this response, CoVs have developed several strategies, including the induction of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (14), proposed to hide viral dsRNAs from innate sensors during genome replication. In addition to these dsRNA molecules, most likely, the viral genome and the sgmRNAs of CoVs could contain highly structured RNA domains that could be recognized by the cell guard sensors (19), as described for other viruses, like hepatitis C virus (20), reovirus (21), coxsackievirus (22), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus (23). However, the nature of these highly structured RNA domains and the molecular mechanisms used by CoVs to avoid their recognition by the cellular sensors are still unknown. In addition, other viruses, such as adenoviruses, transcribe two adenovirus-associated RNA I (VAI) which fold into stem-loop structures that are involved in the blocking of some components of the innate immune pathway, such as the protein kinase R (PKR) (24). Whether RNA viruses, such as CoVs, contain similar RNAs interfering with the innate immune response remains to be determined.",

This RNA motif presented high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) element that is located at the 3\u2032 end of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins. This element is involved in the translation silencing of these mRNAs to favor the resolution of inflammation. The functional role of the viral GAIT-like RNA motif during TGEV infection was further analyzed by mutational analysis using a TGEV infectious clone, demonstrating that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif influenced the innate immune response by affecting the MDA5 pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a CoV RNA domain has been directly involved in the modulation of the innate immune response.",

The specific RNA domain interacting with these cellular proteins was further analyzed. In a first approach, the role of the poly(A) tail in the binding of these proteins with the 3\u2032 end of the genome was studied. To this end, three RNA constructs, one containing the first 504 nucleotides (nt) of the 5\u2032 end of the genome and the others containing the last 493 nt of the 3\u2032 end with or without the poly(A) tail, were generated by in vitro transcription, labeled with biotin, and used as baits for RNA affinity protein isolation (Fig. 1). The RNA baits were incubated with cytoplasmic cell extracts from infected human liver-derived Huh-7 cells, and the pulled-down proteins were detected by Western blotting by using specific antibodies. Huh-7 cells were used instead of swine testis (ST) cells, because Huh-7 cells are susceptible to TGEV and because of the availability of validated antibodies against human proteins (13). As expected, the PABP specifically bound to the 3\u2032 end containing the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). In contrast, all the remaining proteins interacted with the 3\u2032 end both with and without the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1), indicating that EPRS, RRS, p100, and the hnRNPs Q, A1, U, and A0 did not require the poly(A) tail to interact with the genome 3\u2032 end.",

These RNA fragments were designed taking into consideration the predicted secondary structure of the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome and the information available about the 3\u2032-end cis-acting elements involved in CoV replication. Fragments F1 and F2, covering nt 28087 to 28207 and 28147 to 28277, respectively, contained four predicted stem-loops for which no function has been associated. Fragments F3, F4, and F5, spanning nt 28269 to 28388, 28358 to 28481, and 28289 to 28426, respectively, covered a region containing RNA structures similar to the bulged stem-loop (BSL) and the pseudoknot (PK), which have been described to be important for genome replication in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine CoV (BCoV) (25\u201327). Finally, fragment F6, covering nt 28469 to 28580, contained the hypervariable region (HVR) and the highly conserved octanucleotide (OCT) (5\u2032 GGA AGA GC 3\u2032), originally described for MHV (27). The biotin-labeled RNA fragments, generated by in vitro transcription, were used as baits in pulldown assays, together with the full-length 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome as specificity controls. In addition to the expected preferential binding of all proteins to the 3\u2032 end of the genome, a specific binding to F2 was observed for EPRS and RRS, and a preferential binding to F4 was found for hnRNP A1 (Fig. 2B). In the case of hnRNPs Q and A0, these proteins were preferentially pulled down with F2 and F6 and with F2 and F4, respectively (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no preferential binding for any fragment was detected in the case of hnRNP U and p100. Due to the specific interaction of EPRS and RRS with F2, and the positive role of these proteins in CoV RNA synthesis (13) (Marquez-Jurado et al., unpublished), this RNA fragment was selected to further delimitate the RNA domains interacting with both aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.",

F2.2L and F2.2R were comprised of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves of the fragment F2.2 sequence, respectively, while F2.2U contained the upper stem of the structure and F2.2D the two internal bulges. In addition to the expected binding to F2.2, both aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases preferentially bound to fragment F2.2L, which constitutes a 32-nt RNA domain located 410 nt upstream of the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome, within the coding sequence of gene 7 (Fig. 3C). The sequence of this RNA domain showed high identity with the GAIT element, present in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of several mRNAs coding for proinflammatory proteins, such as the ceruloplasmin (Cp) (Fig. 3C) (28, 29). It has been described that IFN-\u03b3 induces the assembly of the GAIT complex, constituted by EPRS, hnRNP Q, the ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). This protein complex interacts with the GAIT element present in different mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins, inhibiting their translation and therefore the harmful accumulation of inflammatory products (29, 30). Interestingly, the secondary structure of the GAIT element, consisting of a stem-loop with an internal asymmetric bulge, was also predicted for the viral RNA domain, including the A and U residues located in the asymmetric internal bulge, which have been reported to be critical for the function of the cellular GAIT element (Fig. 3C) (28, 29). Overall, these data suggest that the viral RNA domain, expanding fragment F2.2L, could constitute a GAIT-like RNA motif.",

To this end, three chimeric mRNAs expressing the luciferase protein, containing either the Cp GAIT element, the TGEV GAIT-like RNA motif, or no GAIT element in the 3\u2032 UTR, were in vitro transcribed, and their translation efficiency was analyzed in the presence or in the absence of the GAIT complex by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Fig. 6). It has been described that the GAIT complex is assembled in monocytic cells after treatment with IFN-\u03b3 (30). Therefore, cytosolic extracts of human U937 monocytic cells untreated or treated with IFN-\u03b3 were used in the in vitro translation reactions as a source of the GAIT complex. As expected, translation of the luciferase gene was detected in all cases in the absence of the GAIT complex (Fig. 6). In contrast, a significant inhibition of luciferase translation was observed from the mRNA constructs containing either the cellular (75%) or the viral (50%) GAIT element in the presence of the GAIT complex (Fig. 6). Interestingly, when increasing amounts of either the cellular or the viral GAIT elements were added to the translation reaction mixtures as competitors, a reversion of the luciferase translation inhibition was observed (data not shown), indicating that the translation inhibition is due to the presence of the GAIT element. These data indicated that, similar to the cellular GAIT element, the viral GAIT-like RNA motif had an inhibitory effect on in vitro translation, probably by interaction with the GAIT complex.",

Based on previously reported functional data of the Cp GAIT element (28, 29), a TGEV recombinant virus harboring mutations in the GAIT-like RNA motif (rTGEV-mutG) was engineered by reverse genetics using a TGEV infectious clone (Fig. 7A) (32). The rTGEV-mutG virus contained the nucleotide substitutions A to G (genomic position 28178), U to C (genomic position 28181), and C to U (genomic position 28190), which were predicted to partially disrupt the stem structure and the internal asymmetric bulge. As the GAIT-like RNA motif is located within the coding region of gene 7, the mutations introduced were silent and maintained the amino acid sequence of protein 7. The rTGEV-mutG virus was successfully rescued and the mutations introduced were present in the recovered mutant virus, even after 20 serial passages in tissue culture of a plaque-purified virus, indicating that they were stably maintained in the rTGEV-mutG genome. In addition, no significant differences in the plaque size and the growth kinetics, at both low (0.05) and high (3) multiplicities of infection (MOI), were observed between the mutant and wild-type (WT) viruses (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif was not essential for virus replication in cell cultures.",

To this end, ST cells were infected at an MOI of 3 with the rTGEV-WT and rTGEV-mutG viruses, and the mRNA levels of a set of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], CCL2, and CXCL9) were analyzed at different hours postinfection (hpi) by RT-qPCR using specific TaqMan assays. As a control of viral replication, the levels of genomic RNA and sgmRNA 7 were analyzed. In addition, to discard a general transcription up- or downregulation during virus infection that could affect the expression of all cellular genes, the mRNA levels of the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) gene, which is involved in the immune response, were also evaluated as a control. As expected, all the analyzed genes increased their expression during the WT virus infection (Fig. 9). Interestingly, all of them were significantly upregulated (from 2- to 20-fold, depending on the gene) in cells infected with the rTGEV-mutG virus compared with in cells infected with the WT virus (Fig. 9). In contrast, no significant differences were detected in the levels of viral genomic RNA, sgmRNA 7, and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA in cells infected with either the WT or mutant viruses (Fig. 9), discarding that proinflammatory RNA upregulation was due to a difference in virus replication or to a general transcription upregulation during rTGEV-mutG infection.",

These proteins recognize dsRNAs, activating the transcription factors IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB, and the subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN (16, 34). In the case of CoVs, it has been described that the viral RNA is recognized by MDA5 (18), although a role for RIG-I was also proposed in several cell types (35). To analyze whether MDA5 or RIG-I signaling was affected by the GAIT-like RNA motif, both sensors were independently silenced in ST cells by using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The silenced cells were then infected with rTGEV-WT or rTGEV-mutG viruses, and the effect on TNF, IFN-\u03b2, and viral genomic RNA production was analyzed by RT-qPCR in comparison with the levels in cells transfected with a negative-control siRNA. Two siRNA transfection steps were needed to achieve a sustained silencing at the mRNA and protein levels of about 43% and 35% for RIG-I and MDA5, respectively (Fig. 10A). Despite the modest reduction of MDA5 expression, it was previously described that a similar reduction is enough to observe an effect on cytokine production (36). In infected MDA5-silenced cells but not in RIG-I-silenced cells, an increment in the viral genomic RNA levels of the rTGEV-WT and rTGEV-mutG viruses was observed compared with nonsilenced cells, being this increment higher in the case of the mutant virus (Fig. 10B, left). As previously observed (see above), in nonsilenced cells, infection by the rTGEV-mutG virus led to increased TNF and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels compared with those caused by infection by the WT virus (Fig. 10B, right). Interestingly, in MDA5-silenced cells, the rTGEV-mutG virus showed the same pattern of cytokine reduction as the WT virus, while this did not occur in RIG-I-silenced cells (Fig. 10B, right). These results suggested that the GAIT-like RNA motif affects the MDA5 signaling pathway.",

A significant reduction in the genomic RNA levels of the rTGEV-WT virus was observed in cells treated with IFN-\u03b2 compared with those in untreated cells. Interestingly, this reduction was higher in IFN-\u03b2-treated cells infected with the rTGEV-mutG virus (Fig. 11, right) than in cells infected with the rTGEV-WT virus, confirming that the GAIT-like RNA motif modulates cytoplasmic sensor signaling.",

In this sense, we previously identified nine cellular proteins that interact with the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome, from which a functional role in virus replication was described for hnRNP Q, PABP, and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases EPRS and RRS (13) (Marquez-Jurado et al., unpublished). In this study, we have identified a novel viral RNA motif, consisting of a 32-nt domain located 410 nt from the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome, which directly interacted with the cellular proteins EPRS and RRS. This RNA motif shared high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the cellular GAIT element that is involved in the modulation of the inflammatory response (29). Similar to the cellular GAIT element, we have shown that the viral RNA motif inhibited the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this motif, indicating that in vitro it behaves as a GAIT-like RNA motif. Finally, a novel finding of this study was that the GAIT-like RNA motif counteracted the host innate immune response triggered by MDA5, at least in cell cultures. Further studies will be needed to confirm this effect in vivo and to analyze the role of the GAIT-like RNA motif in pathogenesis.",

Monocytes and macrophages promote the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to counteract invading microorganisms. However, an unregulated synthesis of these inflammatory products can have detrimental effects in the host. Therefore, the host must have different mechanisms to regulate cytokine production and allow the resolution of inflammation. One of these mechanisms is provided by the GAIT system in monocytic cells (29). In response to IFN-\u03b3, the GAIT complex (constituted by EPRS, hnRNP Q, L13a, and GAPDH) is assembled and, by interaction with the GAIT element present in the 3\u2032 UTR of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins, represses their translation. In this study, we have shown that the viral RNA motif is a GAIT-like RNA motif, based on its capacity to bind the GAIT complex and to inhibit the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this motif. In this sense, EPRS and/or RRS could be components of a protein complex that regulate viral translation by its interaction with the viral GAIT-like RNA motif. Nevertheless, the characterization of an rTGEV-mutG virus, harboring mutations that disrupt the GAIT-like RNA motif, indicated that the GAIT-like RNA motif was not critical in CoV translation and replication in cell cultures, suggesting that during infection the viral RNA motif could have a function different to that described for the cellular GAIT element.",

            "text": "After confirming the dispensability of the GAIT-like motif for virus replication in cell cultures, its potential role modulating the host inflammatory response and more specifically the innate immune response was further analyzed in cell cultures. The innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense that triggers the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN to prevent viral infections (15). In this study, an exacerbated expression of both proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-\u03b2, together with its downstream ISGs (MDA5 and RIG-I), has been observed during infection with the rTGEV-mutG virus, harboring mutations in the GAIT-like RNA motif, compared with that in the rTGEV-WT virus infection. The level of the effect observed on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-\u03b2 was similar or even higher than that reported for CoV and other RNA viruses (14). In addition, we have identified that the MDA5 pathway was the innate immune pathway significantly affected by the GAIT-like RNA motif. In contrast to other RNA viruses, in which structured RNA domains present in their genome are recognized by the cell sensor triggering the innate immune response (20\u201323, 41), the data presented in this study suggested that the TGEV GAIT-like RNA motif interferes with the innate immune response, at least in cell cultures. Regarding the mechanism of action of the GAIT-like RNA motif, it could be postulated that this motif may act directly, preventing the activation of MDA5. Alternatively, the interaction with EPRS and RRS could mask the GAIT-like RNA motif to make it inaccessible to cellular sensors, such as MDA5, thus avoiding the triggering of the innate immune response. In this sense, mutations in the viral GAIT-like RNA motif could facilitate its sensing by MDA5, eliciting a faster and stronger antiviral response, such as the one observed during the infection with the rTGEV-mutG virus. Similar mechanisms have been described in negative-stranded RNA viruses, such as influenza and Ebola viruses, in which a viral protein instead of a cellular protein binds a dsRNA signature in their genomes, hiding them from recognition by the cellular sensors (14). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cellular protein proposed to mask a viral PAMP RNA domain to subvert the host antiviral response.",
