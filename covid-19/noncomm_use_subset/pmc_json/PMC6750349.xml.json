The most common infections associated with FUO are miliary tuberculosis (TB), Q fever, and brucellosis, followed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cytomegalovirus (CMV); Epstein-Barr virus; intra-abdominal, pelvic, intranephric and perinephric abscess; typhoid or enteric fever; toxoplasmosis; and extrapulmonary TB. Notably, in 75% of the HIV patients, FUO is results from secondary infection, rather than from the HIV infection.[10] Furthermore, rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, giant cell/temporal arteritis, adult Still disease, periarteritis nodosa, and microscopic polyangiitis, account for another one-third of FUOs.[10] Moreover, FUOs due to neoplasms and malignancies account for 18% of all FUOs; of them, renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma are the most common neoplasms, followed by acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders.[10] The remaining causes of FUO are miscellaneous disorders, including drug fevers, liver cirrhosis, Crohn disease, and subacute thyroiditis.[10]",

Furthermore, FUO is associated with repeated invasive investigations, presumptive treatment, and a high impact on health care systems due to unnecessary and additional laboratory tests and medications.[10,11] Over 200 causes for FUO have been reported.[10] Relatively few infectious diseases have the potential to cause prolonged fever; therefore, patients with prolonged and perplexing fevers, in whom the infection has been ruled out, pose a diagnostic challenge.[12] Moreover, fever is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits of children and visits to emergency department (ED).[13] Difficulty in diagnosing FUO also makes its treatment difficult. Empirical antibiotics cannot be indicated unless the patient with FUO is neutropenic. In addition, empiric glucocorticoids cannot be indicated without a strong evidence of rheumatologic disease.[14]",

The etiologies of fever may be approached in terms of their height, fever pattern, and duration. Most studies have stressed on the significance of a complete history and comprehensive physical examination. In case of infectious FUO, fever is often accompanied by chills, night sweating, weight loss without loss of appetite, rigors, exudative tonsillitis, or splenomegaly. In general, the longer the FUO remains undiagnosed, the more likely it is to have a noninfectious etiology.[22] A patient presenting with B-symptoms and significant weight loss might have a neoplasm or malignancy as the cause of the FUO. By contrast, joint involvement may indicate rheumatologic disorders.[10,23] Laboratory testing includes complete blood count, three sets of blood cultures, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, urine culture, tuberculin skin test, and tests for biomarkers (such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, CMV immunoglobulin M, HIV antibodies, and heterophile antibodies) in children and young adults. Moreover, imaging techniques include chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and radionuclide scanning.[24]",

The GB system was associated with significantly longer LOS of the patients with unexplained fever. After adjustments for other covariates, age and Charlson comorbidity index were independent LOS predictors. GB did not significantly affect LOS in patients with unexplained fever. Patients with unexplained fever in regional hospitals had a significantly shorter LOS than patients in medical centers. FUO is diagnosed less frequently in adults than in children; however, adult patients are more likely to be admitted and have longer LOSs.[39] The mean age of patients with unexplained fever in medical centers was 21.53 \u00b1 2.50 years, whereas that of patients with idiopathic fever in regional hospitals was 16.63 \u00b1 2.44 years. The mean Charlson comorbidity indexes in medical centers and regional hospitals were 0.37 \u00b1 0.095 and 0.30 \u00b1 0.093, respectively.

Compared to conventional scintigraphic techniques, FDG-PET/CT has following advantages: higher resolution and higher sensitivity for anatomic localization of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic processes.[45] The work-up of patients with FUO demonstrated that the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG-PET/CT is superior to 67Ga single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT.[46] Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that using FDG-PET/CT shortened the diagnostic work-up for FUO.[15,47] A meta-analysis reported that PET and PET/CT had successfully localized the source of fever in 44% and 58% of the patients with classic FUO, respectively, after a series of unsuccessful investigations.[48] The major drawbacks are cost and accessibility; FDG-PET/CT costed \u00a3800, compared with \u00a3250 for a chest\u2013abdomen\u2013pelvis CT. However, this could be offset by earlier definitive treatment due to higher diagnostic sensitivity, which could reduce LOS with an average of \u00a3400 per day.[49] Therefore, FDG-PET/CT can aid in diagnosing FUO, particularly when diagnostic clues are absent.",

After adjustments for other covariates, the GB system and Charlson comorbidity index was found to be positively correlated with increased diagnostic, therapy, and total costs. The increase in health care expenditures from 25.4% to 426.6% significantly exceeded the 2.2% growth in consumer price index for the same period in Taiwan (Table S2). The possible reasons for the higher costs include longer LOSs, additional comorbidities, and higher proportion of older individuals in the study population after GB system implementation (Table 7). Moreover, salaries of physicians in Taiwan are calculated more or less on the basis of FFS. Therefore, physicians demonstrate a natural proclivity to maximize medical services to maximize their income; and the GB system does not provide an incentive for physicians to reduce the volume of medical care. Health care expenditures incurred by patients with unexplained fever did not differ between hospitals with different accreditation levels or in different geographic areas in Taiwan.",

However, after controlling other covariates, the GB was not associated with reduced risks of revisiting the ED within 3 days or readmission within 14 days. Furthermore, none of the tested variables were independent predictors of revisiting the ED within 3 days or being readmitted within 14 days for patients with unexplained fever. A possible reason this observation are the regulations for evaluating the quality of care in hospitals in Taiwan. BNHI has developed a series of plans structured to improve the quality of care while keeping costs under control. The plans offer incentives to health care providers by paying them based on clinical outcomes to care for overall wellbeing of patients. The risks of revisiting the ED within 3 days and readmission within 14 days are the two indicators used by BNHI to measure the quality of care. These two indicators are linked to the reimbursement rate at each hospital. The amount of reimbursement is reduced if the quality of care is determined to be poor. To safeguard against being penalized, all hospitals in Taiwan have made concerted efforts to reduce the 3-day ED revisiting and 14-day readmission rates. In this study, no difference in the risks of revisiting the ED within 3 days or readmission within 14 days between hospitals with different accreditation levels or between different geographic areas of Taiwan was noted.",

First, the NHIRD data did not provide detailed information of patients regarding factors, such as their lifestyle, habits, socioeconomic status, and family history; all of which are possible confounding factors in this study. Second, the NHI claims registries are primarily used for administrative billing alone and thus are not verified for scientific purposes. The laboratory data and information regarding symptoms of patients were lacking, and therefore, discussion of these factors in relation to the GB system is not possible. Furthermore, because of the anonymity of the identification numbers, obtaining additional information by directly contacting the patients was not possible. The accuracy of medical coding in the claims data may affect the data validity. However, the diagnosis data in the NHIRD are highly reliable. The insurance system has mechanisms to monitor the insurance claims. Third, the conclusions derived from a cohort study are generally of lower methodological quality than those from randomized trials because a cohort study is subject to several biases and the necessary adjustments for confounding factors are required. Despite the meticulous design of this study and adequate control of confounding factors, biases associated with possibly unmeasured or unknown confounding factors can occur.",
