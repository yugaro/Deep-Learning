            "text": "Within the past decade, gene therapy and immunization have been considered as new approaches in using proteins for the prevention and treatment of infectious and noninfectious diseases. The role of skin and its capability as a prime site for immunization and also as a potential organ for expressing therapeutic genes and manufacturing their proteins for systemic use have also been considered.1 However, in the absence of a suitable gene-delivery system, the skin-administered therapeutic gene is not taken up into cells and hence the protein is not expressed. Viral vectors have been shown to enhance gene delivery. They profit from selective incorporation into particles guided through the natural presence of genome motifs (packaging signals) without the need for including artificial motifs in viral genome and structural proteins. Expression systems derived from positive-sense RNA viruses can self-amplify and are rapidly highlighted as interesting gene-delivery systems. The genome of these viruses facilitates viral particle production and introduction of functional self-replicating RNA, known as replicon, into target cells. Furthermore, their expression systems permit replication of the delivered gene, which results in prolonged expression windows of the therapeutic gene.2 Among others, flaviviral vectors have been specially considered for gene therapy. The first vectored human vaccine, based on a flavivirus vector, has been recently approved.3 Flavivirus vectors profit from their easy genetic engineering, ease of administration similar to their natural route into skin as the most accessible organ of the body,1 high safety due to their single-round infectious particles (SRIPs),4., 5. prolonged gene expression and efficient delivery of therapeutic genes, steady release of new particles from transfected cells, as well as acting as DNA-launched vectors and naked RNA vectors without integrating into the host cell genome.2 The functionality of the flavivirus vectors and their structural gene-encoded viral particles remain to be well investigated to provide data on their safety and production while being used as a delivery system in gene therapy.",

The polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally into three structural proteins: capsid (C), premembrane (prM)/membrane (M), and envelope (E), and also seven nonstructural (NS) proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5.7., 8., 9. The maturation process of the flaviviral polyprotein is driven by host cellular signalase in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and by a viral protease in the cytosol of host cells.10 Electron microscopy (EM) studies of morphology of flaviviruses have shown that their virions are 40 to 50 nm in diameter, spherical in shape, and include a nucleocapsid and envelope. The envelope contains three major viral proteins: the major envelope protein E and the small membrane protein prM/M.",

These individual viral particles are subsequently transported to the Golgi complex in transport vesicles and, after undergoing post-translational modifications that include the cleavage of the prM protein, are released by exocytosis via the trans-Golgi network.11 The particles have been detected by EM in the lumen of the rER and in the lumen of either the smooth ER or the intermediate compartment.12 These viruses gain their lipid envelopes by budding through the plasma or an intracellular organelle membrane, such as ER or Golgi apparatus.13",

For many viruses it has been shown that VLPs could be produced to be secreted just by expressing their envelope protein genes without including other viral protein genes;25 for example, expression of the M and E envelope proteins of mouse hepatitis virus,26 infectious bronchitis virus,27 the hepatitis B virus surface proteins,28 or human papilloma virus.29., 30. For many flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus,31 West Nile virus,32 and TBEV33., 34. both premature subviral particles (SVPs) and virions have been shown to be assembled in infected cells and become mature via a similar process. Moreover, TBEV particles could pass through the secretory pathway of the cells for exocytosis. These suicidal viral particles represent shuttles for delivering therapeutic genes that can further target dendritic cells for additional immune activation. We are proposing a DNA-based treatment for disorders and infections such as chronic hepatitis and Ebola virus disease.",

After lysing the transfected COS-1 cells with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, the cell lysate was centrifuged and cell pellet was run separately from cell lysate supernatant for WB analysis using a rabbit polyclonal anti-TBEV E protein serum. The WB results showed that a 100 kDa band (indicating CprME polypeptide) appeared in the pellet of cell lysate of pCAG-CprME and pCMV-CprME transfected cells at the earliest sampling time point (24 hpt) and stayed detectable until end of the experiment at 96 hpt (Figure 3B and 3C). Identically, the 70 kDa band (indicating prME polypeptide) could be detected at 24 to 96 hpt in the pellet of cell lysate of pCAG-prME and pCMV-prME transfected cells (Figure 3B and 3C). Such bands were not detected in the cell culture fluid specimens (Figure 2 and Figure 3A). Collectively, these detected (100 and 70 kDa) bands are initially intracellular-membrane-associated TBEV polypeptides (CprME and prME) prior VLPs assembly in COS-1 cells that transfected with the pCAG and pCMV constructs illustrated in Figure 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D.",

Absence of 100 kDa band (indicating CprME polypeptide) was only observed in the supernatant samples of cell lysates after transfected with CprME constructs, in contrast to the pellet samples of these cell lysates (comparing Figure 3C with 3B). It seems premature CprME polypeptide is presented just as a membrane-associated form. The duration of the process of cleavage until assembling as VLPs inside the rER of the transfected cells is also tight, which resulted in missing prME polypeptides in cell lysate specimens. This is due to a successful natural cooperation between the produced C and prME proteins in VLP assembly. The presence of such VLPs in cell lysates were evaluated by comparing the sharpness of a corresponding 55 kDa band (indicating E protein) to negative controls (Figure 3B and 3C).",

This is the first report of generating the VLPs and SVPs of a Swedish TBEV Tor\u00f6 strain in two different cell lines by transfecting its structural protein genes and further more purify TBE particles from cell culture fluids, proven by WB and EM examination. Classical methods such as EM spotlight an attractive approach to develop recombinant structural proteins for various purposes, including therapeutic vaccines and systems to study the biology of flaviviruses. It is necessary to establish a safe and stable expression system for continuous production of TBEVVLPs to develop noninfectious TBEV VLPs37 as a potential subunit vaccine. For this, stable clonal host cells would also be an alternative, as it has been shown for other viruses.38., 39. On the other hand, such VLPs of flaviviruses could also be exploited as suicidal shuttles, in combination with therapeutic TBEV replicons, to assemble as SRIPs to deliver the therapeutic genes in gene therapy of cancer and chronic infections, to the elements of the immune system. Such DNA-based therapeutic vaccines benefit treatment of various infectious and non-infectious diseases via gene therapy.4., 40., 41., 42.",

During time-course sampling, the prME band (70 kDa) was just detected in the supernatant of prME-transfected cell lysate specimens, but not those of CprME (Figure 3B and 3C), indicating that noncleaved C protein, which is cleaved by viral NS3 proteases,43 may influence the dissociation of prME from ER membrane in CprME-transfected cells. However, detecting mature VLPs and SVPs inside these cells and also in cell culture fluid proves the unnecessary nature of C-prM junction cleavage by viral NS3 proteases for VLPs assembly and egress. The currently accepted paradigm is that liberation of mature C by viral NS2B/3 cleavage at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane induces a change at the ER lumen side that promotes efficient signalase cleavage of prM.44 This temporal separation of cleavage events is believed to promote efficient nucleocapsid incorporation into budding virions during flaviviral infection.45",

This affirms our observation of prM cleavage and maturation in to M protein in TBE VLPs. Collectively, the normal maturation of the CprME and prME polypeptides and finally their secretion as mature VLPs and SVPs in to cell culture fluid, as shown in Figure 6, indicate that the gene expression of the four constructs encoding TBEV structural proteins was performed in a way similar to how infectious TBEV naturally undergoes during the flaviviral infection cycle,6., 22. which is likely to be essential for DNA-based vaccine research.41",

However, our study confirmed that the tubular structures, which may not undergo secretion due to their abnormal budding,12., 22. may not be produced in the cells when transfected with pCAG-CprME. This confirms that flaviviral polypeptides produced by pCAG-CprME mainly undergo the flaviviral maturation process to become mature TBE VLPs and pass through the cellular secretory pathway for exocytosis (Figure 7). Such effective production of the stable TBE VLPs could provide abundant suicidal shuttles to deliver various therapeutic RNA replicons to immune system cells, which is essential for gene-based vaccine research.",

This first report of such comparison for flaviviral structural genes\u2019 expression is in accordance with recent studies showing that pCAG drives more effectively target gene expression.46., 47. The pCAG contains the CAG promoter, which is composed of a CMV immediate early enhancer promoter and a chicken \u03b2-actin promoter. The pCMV contains the CMV promoter, which is the most commonly used for eukaryotic expression. The significant difference between CAG and CMV promoters on driving target gene expression, as shown in this study, could be partially explained by their origins.47 Because viral promoters such as CMV are involved in viral replications, they consecutively can be regulated by the host cell defense system.48 In contrast to viral promoters, the promoter CAG encodes \u03b2-actin, which is among the housekeeping genes expressed most liberally and abundantly in various cell lines.49 Thus, the CAG promoter may be less prone to be regulated by the host cell defense system in comparison with viral promoters. Indeed, the CMV enhancer in CAG promoter could also improve the level of target gene transcription.50 Recently, flaviviral replicon RNA has shown to be packaged with the help of coexpressed C protein driven under CMV promoter to form secreted SRIPs that deliver the RNA into neighboring cells. Proposing a new concept in flavivirus DNA vaccine design, which offers an attractive alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because it closely mimics live viral infection without producing an infectious virus.4., 5. This study, by advanced molecular and EM methods, investigated normal assembly, maturation, secretion, and stability of VLPs, along with better expression efficiency of plasmid vector CAG. It also looked at cellular ER proliferation because the virus factory platform provides abundant supportive evidence for safety and improvement of such gene delivery systems in gene therapy.",

The collection of induced ER membranes may function as expanded virus factories, in which translation, exponential genome synthesis, and virus assembly occur.6., 51., 52. Previously, proliferation and reorganization of membranes have been reported only during infection by a flavivirus, such as Kunjin virus-infected Vero cells, Langat virus-infected Vero and tick cells, Japanese encephalitis virus-infected PC12 neuronal cells, and dengue virus-infected dendritic cells.53., 54., 55. This promotes replication and efficient encapsulation of the viral genome into progeny virus during infection.56 The hypertrophy of cellular ER has also been observed in cells infected by other viruses; for example, herpes simplex virus,57 circovirus post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome,58 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus coronavirus.59 Although intracellular cytoplasmic membrane proliferation and rearrangement occur in cells infected with different types of flaviviruses,60 the mechanism of such proliferation and a possible role of flaviviral genes is still not described. Recently, the role of the ER in providing the membrane platform for biogenesis of the viral genome replication complex during flavivirus infection has been well described.53 The findings of our study show that the proliferating ER was the site of not only active viral replication, but also active protein synthesis and VLP biogenesis. Moreover, the findings highlight a possible role for the flaviviral structural gene CprME in induction of ER membrane biogenesis.",

To show the safety and investigate the quality of such SRIPs, more studies are needed. In our study, the molecular and microscopic shapes of the VLPs and SVPs, the drug delivery shuttles, and also the host cell morphology were for the first time investigated in the absence of flavivirus replicons. This study provides supporting data regarding the therapeutic aspects and safety issues of such SRIP use. We also constructed the therapeutic flavivirus replicons encoding the therapeutic gene for hepatitis, and tested in vitro for replication rate efficiency and also subcutaneously in a mice model that showed convincing results in eliciting an immune response against chronic hepatitis infection (Supplementary Figures A-D). The results also show that to increase the efficiency of transferring such therapeutic genes inserted in a flavivirus replicon, there is a need for an abundant reliable gene delivery system, such as the VLPs described in this study.",

By deep molecular methods and EM investigation, these DNA constructs were shown to produce initial TBEV structural polypeptides that were processed in advance and modified to produce mature TBE VLPs that are secretable naturally and normally via exocytosis from the transfected cells. Better efficiency of CAG promoter in directing the gene expression of the DNA constructs was also reported in comparison with the CMV promoter. We also report a possible role for CprME structural genes of TBEV in ER proliferation of transfected host cells. Besides microscopic evidence, the time-course sampling showed that this process of TBE viral particles encoded by DNA constructs is in accordance with the natural life cycle of the virus, leading us to propose these designed DNA constructs as suitable and successful TBE VLP shuttle producers for delivering therapeutic replicons to immune system cells.",
