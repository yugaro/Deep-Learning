            "text": "In the past 10 years, a lot of attention has been given to bats as reservoirs of emerging\nzoonotic viruses. This has been as a result of the high detection rate of previously unknown\nviral sequences in bats coupled with the emergence of pathogens, such as Hendra, Nipah, Severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Corona, Ebola and Marburg viruses, all of which are highly\nvirulent and pose a great zoonotic risk [2, 3, 8, 9, 17]. Bats, being\nthe only flying mammals with ancient evolutionary origins and long life span, are capable of\ncovering great distances during migrations, rendering them suitable hosts and reservoirs for\nvarious viruses. Paramyxoviruses from the family Paramyxoviridae have been\nimplicated in several human epidemics and mortalities [6, 10, 19]. Several studies have indicated bats as potential natural reservoirs of\nParamyxoviruses, such as Henipavirus-, Respirovirus- and Morbillivirus-related viruses [1, 4]. This\nundoubtedly presents a threat to the health of the human population in areas where human\nbeings live in close proximity to fruit bat species [7].\nIn Zambia, straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) annually converge in\nKasanka National Park (KNP).",

The relatively low\nnucleotide homology might indicate that these sequences originate from novel paramyxoviruses.\nThe samples from Zambia formed clusters with the Henipavirus-related viruses and with the\nunclassified Bat paramyxoviruses (Fig. 1). Within the Henipavirus-related virus cluster, two groups (A and B) were observed.\nGroup A comprised novel Zambian strains closely related to the Nipah (NC002728, FN86955 and\nAF212302) and Hendra (AF017149 and NC001906) viral sequences, while Group B comprised a\ncluster of Zambian strains, in close relationship with an unclassified Bat PV from Ghana\n(JN648085) and Cedar virus (JQ001776) (Fig. 1). The\nremaining Zambian strains, including the novel AB853106 sequence, formed a cluster with the\nunclassified Bat PV sequences from Ghana (JN648078, JN648081, JN648087 and JN648089) and Congo\nBrazzaville (HE647835 and HE647837) (Fig. 1). The\nclose relatedness of the viral sequence from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville strains with those\nfrom Zambia might imply the ability of bats to harbor and transmit similar viruses over long\nand diverse geographical distances. This is facilitated by their ability to migrate, covering\nthousands of kilometers to their hibernation and feeding sites [11]. Along their migratory path, they interact directly or indirectly with\nseveral terrestrial mammalian species in different geographical locations, thus enhancing the\ninterspecies transmission of viruses [11]. Humans can\nbecome exposed to these viruses through environmental contamination with urine and feces from\nbats. Although paramyxovirus infections derived from bats have been reported in humans in\nBangladesh [13], none have been reported in Africa. The\nabsence of cases might be as a result of under-reporting. As such continued surveillance and\nassessment of the zoonotic risk posed by these viruses still remains important.",
