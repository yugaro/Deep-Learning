We performed a microarray analysis comparing ODN CpG-2006-treated versus untreated Akata cells. Most of the \u22652-fold changes in gene expression were upregulation and only few downregulation. Among upregulated genes, we were mainly interested in those involved in cytokine (human interleukin 10; hIL-10) and chemokine expression (CXCL10), B-cell activation (CD40), transcription (NF-\u03baB) and apoptosis (FAS) as these genes are those that preferentially determine cell proliferation and survival (Supplementary Table 1). Thirteen genes, including two regulating cell cycle, one transcription factor, one involved in B-cell differentiation and apoptosis, four of diverse functions and four of unknown function, showed downregulation following ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Supplementary Table 2).",

CD40 expression was increased upon ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Figure 1a).

We determined whether treatment with distinct TLR9 ligands would similarly result in a MyD88-dependent effect on cell survival. Also, we explored whether a class A ODN, that displays low specificity for B cells, exerts similar effects on BL cells as class B ODNs that possess a high specificity for B cells. Therefore, we treated Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells with ODN CpG-2216 (type A), ODN CpG-2006 (type B) and ODN GpC-2006 (type B control), respectively, and analyzed the viability of the cells by Trypan Blue exclusion assay and PE-Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining. The Trypan Blue exclusion assay showed that treatment of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 reduced the survival of cells within 48 h to below 50% of not treated cells and treatment with ODN CpG-2216 to almost 50% of not treated cells after 72 h (Figure 2a). By contrast, the survival of DN-MyD88 Akata cells was not, if at all, reduced by treatment with any of the three ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2a). These findings were corroborated by the Annexin V/7-AAD assay revealing that the viability of Akata cells was drastically affected by treatment with class B ODNs and to a lesser extent with class A ODN, contrasting DN-MyD88 Akata cells that were not affected by treatment with ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2b and quantification in Figure 2c). Thus, treatment of Akata cells with ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 triggers TLR9 signaling via MyD88 and results in cell death.",

Thus, the activity of caspase-3 and -7 in ODN-treated Akata cells was detected using a luminogenic substrate, which gives rise to a luminescent signal proportional to caspase-3/7 activity. Triggering with TLR9 ligands for 48 h increased the luminescent signal about twofold as compared with no triggering. This increase was abolished by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Figure 3a), indicating that TLR9 triggering resulted in increased caspase activity in Akata cells and that this activity was not increased if cells were concomitantly treated with a caspase inhibitor. These findings were corroborated using PI staining, which indicate that Akata cell death induced by treatment with ODNs can be abrogated by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Figure 3b); and by western blotting showing that PARP cleavage is increased by ODN treatment and can be reduced by the inhibitor (Figure 3c). Thus, ODN-induced cell death of Akata cells was found to be caspase-3/7 dependent and therefore due to apoptosis.",

Hence, we tested whether TLR9 agonists affect the survival of EBV-positive Akata cells and of EBV-negative Akata31 cells in a similar fashion. Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 strongly decreased the percentages of surviving Akata cells or Akata 31 cells between 24 and 72 h compared with untreated cells. Nevertheless, the effect on Akata 31 cells was less marked (Figure 4a). The percentages of apoptotic Akata 31 cells assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD staining after 72 h of treatment, however, were comparable to those of Akata cells (Figure 4b). Treatment with ODN CpG-2216, ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 resulted in similar respective decreases in viability of Akata cells versus Akata31 cells due to apoptosis. Treatment with class A ODN CpG-2216 exhibited almost no negative impact on cell survival compared with treatment with the class B ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 (Figure 4b). These results showed that EBV-negative Akata31 cells exhibited a higher level of spontaneous cell death by apoptosis compared with EBV-positive Akata cells and corroborated the lower effect of TLR9 triggering by class A ODN compared with triggering by class B ODNs. Moreover, the results suggested that the presence of EBV does not prevent EBV-positive Akata cells from TLR9 triggering-induced cell death compared with EBV-negative Akata31 cells.",

Thus, we assessed hIL-10 mRNA expression in BL cells treated with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006. All five BL cell lines tested expressed hIL-10 mRNA following treatment with ODN CpG-2006, the values peaking preferentially at 6 h post treatment (Figure 6a). Peak hIL-10 mRNA expression levels varied from 1.3 transcripts over HMBS in Ramos BL cells to 48 transcripts in Mutu-I BL cells. Treatment with ODN GpC-2006 also resulted in induction of hIL-10 mRNA expression but in lower levels, except in Akata cells. Similar variation of results was observed when analyzing hIL-10 protein levels (Figure 6b). Thus, TLR9 triggering of distinct BL cells resulted in a broad range of hIL-10 mRNA and hIL-10 protein expression levels, and the magnitude of the level seemed independent of EBV status.",

ODN GpC-2006 binds to TLR9, but in contrast to CpG-2006 it does not lead to TLR9 signaling in HEK293 cells or to changes in the secondary structure of the ectodomain.32 Therefore, we examined whether downstream signaling of TLR9 via MyD88 is involved in the induction of cell death. Indeed, experiments using Akata cells overexpressing a MyD88 dominant-negative mutant indicated that both ODNs induce cell death of BL cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. Others demonstrated that ODNs induce cell death independently of the CpG motif, of TLR933 or even of the whole-ODN sequence.34 Another pathway that is triggered by CpG ODNs, but is TLR9-independent, was described in monocytes and involves the activation of the Src family kinases Lyn and Hck.35 In our experiments, BL cell death induced by TLR9 triggering correlated with increased caspase activity and was caspase-dependent, thus most likely due to apoptosis.",

The role of TLR9 SNPs in BL is unknown. To start to investigate this we analyzed the frequencies of given SNPs in BL patients and healthy individuals and found them to be similar. A recent report suggests that the rs5743836 polymorphism, which was also detected here, confers an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in people from Portugal and Italy but not from the United States.20 The association of the C allele rs5743836 with lack of cell death upon TLR9 triggering observed here in the Mutu-I and BJAB BL cell lines is striking. It does not allow establishing a causal link, but justifies the hypothesis that the distinct cell death responses upon CpG ODN treatment in BL cells may be linked to TLR9 SNPs. Notably, the C allele of rs5743836 exhibits greater NF-\u03baB-binding affinity because of an additional NF-\u03baB transcriptional binding site that may lead to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.36 Hence, the presence of the C allele seems to result in enhanced NF-\u03baB activation following TLR9 triggering. This may lead to protection of ODN CpG treatment-induced apoptosis that can be observed in BL cells without the C allele.",
