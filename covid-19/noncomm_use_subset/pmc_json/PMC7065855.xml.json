Structured Query Language (SQL) queries were written to identify and abstract all demographic information (e.g., age and sex) and ED health status (e.g., vital signs and laboratory result values). Extraction and screening of variables indicators included vital signs, blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, and arterial blood gas score analysis, screening of key indicators, and completion of prediction model.",

The basic idea was that given a specified external learning algorithm, the prediction accuracy of all subsets of variable combinations were calculated through RFE, and number of the subset with the highest prediction accuracy was chosen as the optimal number. Then, the optimal number was used in RFE as the parameter to determine the entry predictor of the final model. In this research, the decision tree was used to select the predictors into the final model. Also, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the variable correlation of the factors in model and the results were shown using a heat map. To explore the most important factors, we reduced the optimal number to a smaller one and repeated the above process. The co-existing factors were chosen for further discussion.",

Further logistic regression analysis showed that serum CK-MB and CTnT levels were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with fever, which should be given clinical attention. Troponin T is one of the clinically recognized markers to reflect myocardial injury. When its level increases, it can reflect the increased severity of myocardial injury, with high specificity.[13\u201315] Previous studies have suggested that myocardial injury, as reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels in plasma, is common in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).[16] The main reason for poor prognosis in patients with severe sepsis is that patients often have cardiac dysfunction. Once the cardiovascular system is damaged, the death rate of patients increases greatly.[17]",

When HR, RR and SBP increased in patients with fever, SPO2 should be detected in time, and should be improved by early non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation treatment, so as to reasonably shorten the mechanical ventilation time to reduce the mortality of patients.

In addition, if more indicators are involved, it is not always possible to ensure that every factor can be obtained in a short time.
