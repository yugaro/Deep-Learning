The clinical symptoms of PDCoV are similar to those of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), but the mortality rates are lower in PDCoV-affected nursing pigs [2]. PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012, while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in the United States in 2014 [3]. Subsequently, PDCoV was detected in Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, indicating that it is widespread among the world's pig populations; moreover, PDCoV can have devastating effects on the swine industry [4]. However, no treatments or vaccines are available for PDCoV.",

            "text": "Similarly, IBV [11] and PEDV showed no HA activity in the absence of trypsin or neuraminidase treatment, and trypsin-treated TGEV [612] also showed HA activity. These observations suggest that trypsin or neuraminidase can successfully elicit HA activity and agglutinate erythrocytes. IBV, TGEV and PEDV agglutinate erythrocytes by using \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid on the cell surface as a binding site [1013]. Our results showed that pretreatment of erythrocytes with trypsin or neuraminidase made the cells resistant to agglutination by PDCoV, indicating that sialic acid was a crucial component of the erythrocyte receptors for viral binding. Thus, we speculate that PDCoV has a sialic acid-binding activity that enables the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes. Further studies are needed to verify this suggestion.",

Inhibition of virus-specific HA can be used to measure antibody responses to virus infection. In the current study, clinical swine serum (verified to be PDCoV-positive by ELISA) was detected by HI testing. Our investigation showed that PDCoV-positive serum could inhibit the agglutinating ability of the virus, suggesting that sera from such swine have been exposed to or infected with PDCoV.",
