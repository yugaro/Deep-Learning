            "text": "Mechanical ventilation may induce and exacerbate lung injury, in contrast to its lifesaving effects. It has previously been demonstrated that biotrauma is an underlying mechanism of lung injury, important factors of which include inflammation and the innate immune response (1). Biological markers of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) are important for early diagnosis and prognosis, and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of VALI. Currently identified biomarkers of VALI are key elements of the inflammatory and immune response pathways; however, the precise function of each mediator remains to be elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have validated the sensitivity or specificity of any biological markers that may aid early diagnosis or treatment of VALI (2,3). Further studies are required in order to identify novel, sensitive and specific biological markers.",

Therefore, PMNs or key mediators of the PMN regulatory signaling pathway may be molecular candidates for the occurrence of VALI (5). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a 25-kDa protein of the lipocalin family, was originally isolated from specific neutrophil granules (6,7). In addition to excretion by activated neutrophils, NGAL may be released in small quantities by epithelial and kidney tubular cells, and during inflammation or injury. Elevated NGAL is an early blood-based marker of acute kidney injury and is detectable within 2\u201312 h following an ischemic/toxic insult in patients with cardiovascular diseases (8,9).",

The expression level of NGAL, which is extensively involved in inflammation and the immune response, is an indicator of PMN activation. As an acute and secretory phase protein, NGAL is easily detected in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (10,11). The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the use of NGAL as a novel diagnostic marker for VALI. The results indicated that NGAL levels increase in lung tissue, BAL fluid and serum during VALI in mice. Therefore, NGAL may represent a novel diagnostic marker for the early prediction of patients at high risk of VALI.",

The reduction in mortality associated with low tidal volume ventilation in patients with acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome has resulted in an increased research interest toward the underlying mechanism of VALI (16). The roles of the innate immune response and inflammation in the pathogenesis of VALI have been extensively studied in recent years. It has previously been suggested that inflammation may not be integral to the initiation of VALI; however, prevalent data in the field suggests a major pathogenetic role of inflammation and lung neutrophil recruitment. Therefore, investigators have searched for biological markers of VALI and therapeutic targets that may facilitate treatment.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that NGAL expression is associated with acute injury, particularly acute kidney injury. However, an association between NGAL and acute lung injury has not yet been reported. The present study characterized the expression profile of NGAL in mice subjected to different mechanical ventilation protocols. NGAL mRNA and protein expression levels in lung tissue increased under all mechanical ventilation treatments; however, a significant increase was observed following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. A similar NGAL increase was further detected in BAL fluid and serum, and was notably increased following high-volume or high-PIP mechanical ventilation. NGAL expression was time-dependent under high-volume mechanical ventilation treatment. Immunohistochemical localization studies revealed increased NGAL expression in lung endothelium, alveolar epithelial cells, and infiltrating neutrophils. NGAL is easily detected in serum and BAL fluid (10,11). The results of the present study verify the role of NGAL as a novel and potential biomarker for VALI. A previous study revealed that plasma concentrations of NGAL were increased in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury and a conventional mechanical ventilation model in piglets (18). Serum NGAL levels were additionally significantly increased in lung transplant patients (19).",
