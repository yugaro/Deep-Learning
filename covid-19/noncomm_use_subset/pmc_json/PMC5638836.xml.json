Classically, the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which sometimes causes a severe LRTI, and as such, many infants with RSV infection require hospitalization23). Recent studies have demonstrated that the RV is also an important cause of LRTI in infants45). Although some reports have described the importance of the RV in causing an LRTI2456), the data pertaining to the clinical significance of RV infections in infants are inconsistent. Some studies presented the evidences that RV is the main organism in 21% and 29% of infants with bronchiolitis, and other studies concluded that RV respiratory infection was not significantly associated with any age group.",

In infections with RSV and RV, TH2 cells develop and Treg cells inhibit virus-specific T cell responses78).

In our previous pediatric study, IL-10 levels were significantly higher in H1N1 patients infected in 2009 who presented with severe pneumonia in comparison to mild pneumonia20). These findings may suggest that because of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of IL-10, elevated IL-10 levels present in severe disease may have additional effects that aid in the control of the disease. Similar to H1N1 infection, in previous study regarding cytokine gene expression in the induced sputum from children with virus induced acute asthma, it was demonstrated that IL-10 mRNA was increased in virus induced acute asthma, which was reduced upon the recovery phase21). During RSV induced inflammation, especially severe RSV infection, Th2-, Th9-, and Th17-related cytokines are elevated. Murine studies presented that the combined actions of regulatory factors such as CD4 regulatory T cells and IL-10 inhibits the inflammatory cytokine response and limit RSV-induced disease22). Another study also demonstrated that the IL-10 level was higher in the acute phase than the convalescent phase in both RV and RSV infections, which was significantly different in comparison to the control group14). The increased IL-10 level found during an acute viral infection may suggest resolution of the inflammatory process. There is evidence that patients with a decreased IL-10 response could have a greater inflammatory response to viral infections and an increased risk for recurrent wheezing2324).",
