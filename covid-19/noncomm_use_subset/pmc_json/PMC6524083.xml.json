From the owner's description, the seizures were consistent with focal limbic seizures (bilateral mydriasis, chewing, salivation, and gazing), that is, focal seizures with impaired responsiveness (former; complex partial seizures) with orofacial involvement, with and without evolving into generalized seizures. Phenobarbital (2.7 mg/kg PO q12h) was prescribed for 4 days by another veterinarian. At the time of presentation (day 5), although the convulsive seizures were controlled, neurological examination showed obtundation, tetraparesis, loss of postural reactions in all limbs, bilateral loss of menace response, and bilateral mydriasis with normal pupil light reflex. Nociception and spinal reflexes were normal. These neurological findings suggested diffuse bilateral forebrain disease. The body temperature was 40.8\u00b0C and blood tests revealed slight increase of white blood cells within the reference range (19,400/\u03bcL; ref. 5,500\u2010195,000), increased total protein (8.0 g/dL; ref. 5.5\u20107.8), aspartate aminotransferase (>1000 IU/L; ref. 16\u201053), alanine aminotransferase (409 IU/L; ref. 18\u201084), total bilirubin (0.6 mg/dL; ref. 0\u20100.2), and creatine kinase (>1000 IU/L; ref. 89\u2010312). Detection tests for feline immunodeficiency virus antibody and feline leukemia virus antigen were negative, and feline coronavirus and Toxoplasma gondii titers were 1 : 100 and <1 : 8, respectively. In addition, RT\u2010PCR of Borna disease virus using a serum sample was negative. The heart rate was around 200 rpm, and the mean blood pressure was 95\u2010100 mm Hg. Thoracic and abdominal X\u2010rays were normal. These clinical findings suggested the cat was in postictal state, in nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or extreme sensitivity to the adverse effects of PB. Phenobarbital was discontinued, and zonisamide (ZNS; 4.6 mg/kg PO q12h), meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg SC q24h), ampicillin (25 mg/kg IV q12h), and IV fluid therapy with glycyrrhizin and glutathione were administered. Two days later (day 7), seizures were under control, and the above\u2010mentioned neurological findings and temperature had recovered. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.4 Tesla Aperto; Hitachi, Japan) of the head was performed on day 8, which revealed bilateral hippocampal swelling with T2\u2010weighted/fluid\u2010attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1\u2010weighted hypointensity that showed strong contrast enhancement after IV administration of gadodiamide (0.2 mL/kg; Omniscan, Daiichi\u2010Sankyo, Japan) on transverse (Figure 1) and dorsal planes. A cerebrospinal fluid tap was not performed due to suspected increased intracranial pressure indicated by narrowing sulci, ventricles (on transverse and dorsal planes), and cisterna magna (on sagittal plane) (not shown). From these MRI findings, feline hippocampal necrosis (FHN) and limbic encephalitis (LE) were suspected.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n",

Seizures were well controlled (only 1 focal seizure after starting ZNS) and the neurological status remained normal for 1 month. However, clustering focal limbic seizures with or without evolution into generalized seizures recurred on day 39 and the clinical condition of the cat gradually deteriorated. In spite of increased dosing of ZNS (7.5 mg/kg; 20.9 \u03bcg/mL), the cat developed status epilepticus on day 94. Traditional treatment for status epilepticus, including IV administrations of diazepam, PB, and levetiracetam, and continuous rate infusion administrations of diazepam, inhibited convulsive seizures, but consciousness was not recovered. Finally, owing to stupor and severe azotemia with myoglobinuria, the cat was euthanized (day 96).",

A live cell staining using rat\u2010cultured hippocampal neurons showed that the cat serum and human serum from a patient with LE (used as a positive control) contained antibodies to neuronal cell surface proteins (Figure 3). Additionally, the same procedure was performed in 3 healthy cats and 3 epileptic cats as negative controls. Although 1 healthy cat serum (#1) antibodies bound to neurons (shown in the Supporting Information), other control sera did not bind at all (Figure 3). A cell\u2010based binding assay for LGI1 was performed, as LGI1 autoantibodies are frequently found in humans and cats with LE.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The case cat serum antibodies as well as control (healthy and epileptic) cats serum antibodies (diluted 1 : 500) nonspecifically bound to COS7 (a common cell line originated from an African green monkey kidney) cell\u2010surface slightly, irrespective of the expression of the LGI1 protein, whereas a human LE patient serum (positive control) specifically bound to LGI1\u2010expressing cells (Figure 4). This indicates that the feline serum contained other antibodies than LGI1 antibodies. To identify the target antigen, we conducted immunoprecipitation with the feline serum antibodies from rat\u2010cultured hippocampal neurons. A protein with a molecular mass of 190 kDa (p190) was specifically detected only in the immunoprecipitate of the case cat, but not in those of the control cats (Figure 5). Note that there was no specific antigen for serum of the 1 healthy cat (#1) which bound to rat cultured neurons (Figure 5, the lane of Healthy cat #1). Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this protein band showed that molecular weights of 3 peptide fragments derived from p190 coincided with those from the rat deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) protein (LFCTEVSTGK, AFNNAGEGVPLYESATTR, and GVGPLSDPILFR). The score of SEQUEST search algorithm from BioWorks software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 28.13, indicating a high confidence score (>20). Although 190 kDa was larger than the estimated molecular weight of rat DCC (157.74 kDa), a previous study indicated that the molecular weight of endogenous DCC on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was about 190 kDa.10 This difference is explained by the post\u2010translational modification of DCC protein in neurons. Western Blot analysis confirmed that p190 is DCC. Then, a cell\u2010surface binding assay using COS7 cells transfected with DCC was performed. Human neuromyotonia patient serum, used as a positive control,8 bound to the DCC\u2010expressing cells. The case cat serum showed a specific and strong binding to DCC\u2010expressing cells (Figure 6). Although healthy and epileptic control cats' sera showed nonspecific slight binding to COS7 cells as well as Figure 4 (all 3 cats in each group were tested), the specific binding of serum antibodies to DCC was not observed in healthy and epileptic control cats. Therefore, the case cat had DCC autoantibodies.",
