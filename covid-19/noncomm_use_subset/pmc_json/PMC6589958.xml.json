This finding is explained by that undergraduate and graduate curricula in medical schools in Jordan do not cover surveillance and its importance. Moreover, hospitals\u2019 training programs do not stress on disease notification. This underscores the need to provide physicians with proper training on surveillance and repeatedly inform physicians about the notifiable disease under surveillance. Such training has been shown to improve the awareness and practice in New South Wales20 and Washington.13",

Among all physicians who diagnosed at least one communicable disease under surveillance during their practice, only 39.5% of them had filled a notification form. A similar level of underreporting in other studies proposes a need of knowledge of the study of disease transmission of a few notifiable infections. Consequently, this may cast question on the esteem of the notification process and illness surveillance framework. Feedback to doctors showing that preventive action is taken as a result of their notifications may be the most effective way to improve notification practices.9",

Implementing workshops emphasizing the importance of and the process for notifiable disease surveillance in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education also would be valuable, as would including other health care workers in assistant physicians in their reporting task. Institutional computerized reporting systems and feedback to physicians also may help improve reporting rates.17",

There should be regular awareness, information, education, and communication programs concerning NPHSS and its importance to the public and for health care facility workers on a regular basis. This will help them appreciate the importance of the system and thus improve their general attitude toward it. Moreover, undergraduate and postgraduate health professionals programs should be restructured to include surveillance education and training. Knowledge and incentive, eliminating barriers to disease reporting, and promoting some assisting factors could help reduce the underreporting of notifiable diseases. Further comprehensive studies that include all health care providers in all heath sectors of Jordan are recommended. Such studies might be valuable to provide baseline data for future evaluation of the new reporting system in Jordan.",
