Three of the more common hepatitis viruses contain a genome of positive strand ssRNA: hepatitis A virus (HAV, also known as Hepatovirus A, a Hepatovirus, member of Picornaviridae), hepatitis C virus (HCV Hepacivirus C, a Flaviviridae member), and hepatitis E virus (HEV Orthohepevirus A, of the Hepeviridae family). Other viral species causing human hepatitis can contain an ssRNA(\u2010) genome (e.g., hepatitis D virus) or are retro\u2010transcribing viruses (such as the hepatitis B virus). Despite their shared replication strategy, host specificity and tissue tropism, HAV, HCV, and HEV share very little sequence conservation, indicative of their independent evolutionary origins. We compared the genome sequences of a large number of these three viral species to evaluate commonalities and differences between and within the respective clades.",

In lack of the cap assembly that is common in other RNA virus species, translation of HAV is initiated by a secondary structure formed by the 5\u2032\u2010untranscribed region of the RNA genome, which functions as a ribosome entry site (McKnight & Lemon, 2018; Vaughan et al., 2014). Of note is that the codon use of HAV is quite distinct from that of its host, a property that is also reflected by its low GC content (37%); as a consequence, this virus is slow to replicate in human cells. The virus is transmitted via the fecal\u2013oral route, and the relative high stability of unenveloped virus particles in the environment enables transmission via fecally contaminated food and water. Yearly, approximately 1.5 million clinical cases of HAV occur globally, although at least ten times as many new undocumented infections may occur, as suggested by serological evidence (reviewed in Vaughan et al., 2014). The infection is mostly self\u2010limiting and results in lifelong immunity.",

The ssRNA(+) genome encodes a large polypeptide of which it is uncertain whether it is active as such or first processed into separate proteins with distinct functions, and 2 shorter proteins, translated from partly overlapping open reading frames (recently reviewed in Primadharsini, Nagashima, & Okamoto, 2019).",

For HAV, three genotypes that infect humans (I, II and II, each with subtypes A and B) are recognized, and these belong to a single serotype. Three more genotypes are specific to the simian host (Costa\u2010Mattioli et al., 2003), while a previously described genotype VII is reclassified as IIB. A substitution rate of 9.76 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions per site per year (ssy) was calculated, based on complete VP1 sequences from French genotype IA isolates (Moratorio et al., 2007), but this may be an overestimate, as an analysis of complete genome sequences from multiple countries produced an estimate of 1.00 \u00d7 10\u20134 ssy (Kulkarni, Walimbe, Cherian, & Arankalle, 2009). Thus, the range is likely to be around one in ten thousand substitutions per site per year, or roughly one or two substitutions per viral genome per year. This reflects the slow evolutionary rate of this virus. A last common ancestor of human HAV and the simian genotypes was estimated to have existed between 1,250 and 3,500 years ago (Kulkarni et al., 2009). However, human HAV is presumed to have originated from a rodent virus as a result of a host jump (Dexler et al., 2015).",

HCV is subdivided in at least 7 major genotypes, with multiple subtypes therein (Simmonds et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2014). Genetic diversity between the HCV genotypes is about 30%, while subtypes within a given genotype differ by 15%\u201325% (Hartlage, Cullen, & Kapoor, 2016; Preciado et al., 2014). The different genotypes roughly coincide with geographical distribution, with genotypes 1, 2, and 3 being globally detected; genotypes 4 and 5 are more prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, and genotype 6 is found in Southeast Asia, as is reviewed elsewhere (Ansaldi et al., 2014). The RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase of HCV lacks proof\u2010reading activity, resulting in a high mutational rate of 10\u20135\u201310\u20134 nucleotides per replication cycle (Duffy, Shackelton, & Holmes, 2008), thus producing a heterogenic quasi\u2010species population within infected individuals. Estimates for individual nucleotides produced a substitution rate of between 1.40 and 1.72 \u00d7 10\u22123 ssy (Takahashi et al., 2004), which is 10 times higher than that of HAV. Hepacivirus species have now also been isolated from dogs, horses, and other mammals, which poses the possibility that HCV originated from a nonprimate host. In particular, a virus replicating in the equine host might have either made a natural host jump or it may have been aided by medical practices with horse\u2010derived products (Hartlage et al., 2016).",

Separate phylogenetic trees were produced for the three viral species, with 134 HAV genomes, 2,542 HCV genomes, and 557 HEV genomes, as shown in Figure 1. All trees were drawn to scale, to illustrate the much lower genomic diversity of HAV compared with the other two species. The trees for HCV and HEV were collapsed at 90% identity for graphical representation. The HAV branches remained un\u2010collapsed, since the shown branches per genotype all have a similarity >90%. The genomic diversity of HEV is higher than that of HAV but lower than that of HCV, as illustrated by the branch lengths of the trees. The produced HAV tree is in good agreement with previously published data (Vaughan et al., 2014), although we did not include simian serotypes IV to VI. Our HCV tree that was based on 2,542 genomes is also mostly in agreement with previous publications that used smaller datasets. A neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on 162 genome sequences (Jackowiak et al., 2014) already identified a relationship between genotype 1 (Gt1) and Gt4, which is also visible in Figure 1; these two genotypes have evolved later than the other genotypes (Preciado et al., 2014). The relationship between Gt2 and Gt7 was also noted before. However, our data produced a better resolution of genotypes than the NJ tree published by Jackowiak and colleagues. An ML tree based on 129 genome sequences (Smith et al., 2014) also did not fully resolve the branch of Gt1 and Gt4 with respect to the other genotypes. It is unclear on what data the tree shown in a review article (Preciado et al., 2014) was based, in which Gt1 and Gt4 were separated. In our tree, the branch leading to Gt1 and Gt4 is placed between Gt3 and Gt6/Gt8. Upon closer investigation of HCV genomes for which a subtype was specified in their Genbank annotation, only a few annotations did not match the current nomenclature, all of which were given a genotype before standardization of the nomenclature (Tokita et al., 1996). This illustrates that historical Genbank annotations must be interpreted with caution. The six genotypes of HEV are also well resolved in Figure 1, but the subtypes within these genotypes are not. Notably, one collapsed branch contained members of subtypes 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1f, whose close distances have been noted before (Smith et al., 2016). On the other hand, the genetic diversity within Gt3 is extensive, even if rabbit isolates are ignored (Figure 1). Based on their overall genomic similarity, members of Gt3 could be considered to belong to multiple genotypes that could be newly defined. This was observed by Smith and colleagues as well, but they decided to keep the nomenclature of genotypes 1\u20134 as proposed by Lu, Li, and Hagedorn (2006), since this was already well established. As a result, there is no consistent degree of similarity within the different genotypes and their subtypes for HEV, in contrast to the more transparent nomenclature of HCV.",

            "text": "The codon usage of the three viral species was next analyzed. Typically, codon usage is expressed as relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), which calculates the over\u2010 or underabundance of specific codons relative to their expected frequencies based on the nucleotide composition of an open reading frame (ORF). For instance, codon use of HEV was analyzed by RCSU (Hu et al., 2011). Appendix Figure A1 compares the RSCU values of the three viral species, plotted in a wheel plot. This identified differences in codon usage between HAV on the one hand and HCV/HEV on the other hand. The codon usage of HAV is suboptimal for replication in the human host, while the codon usage of HCV is highly adapted to that of human cells, as has been described before (Pint\u00f3, Aragon\u00e8s, Costafreda, Ribes, & Bosch, 2007). RCSU values are an excellent means to compare codon usage of individual genes within a given (prokaryotic) genome, as cells typically control gene expression by minor codon preferences (Sharp & Li, 1986). However, when comparing virus proteomes with large differences in codon usage, we consider it useful to look at this usage without correcting for nucleotide composition differences, as a dependence exists between nucleotide composition and codon usage preferences. Thus, we calculated codon usage as the fraction of used codons per given amino acid. Without a correction for nucleotide composition, the differences between HAV and HCV/HEV is amplified, and now the values can be compared with the overall codon usage of human cells (Figure 2). As can be seen, two trends describe the deoptimized codon use of HAV: (a) the virus strongly prefers codons with T over C at the third (wobble) position, while for human cells it is the other way round; this is clearly visible for Cys, Asp, Phe, Asn, and Tyr (Figure 2c). These are all amino acids for which only two codons are available, but the same third\u2010base preference for T can also be seen for Ala and Pro; (b) A weaker preference for codons having A at the third position is visible for Lys, Gly, and Arg. The deoptimized codon usage is still evident when only those amino acids are considered that occur at a high frequency (>4.5%) in the polypeptide of HAV (Figure 2d). That HAV strongly prefers T at the third position may be partly responsible for its high T\u2010content (32.8% on average, Table 1), but this is not a general rule. For instance, rabies virus (a negative strand ssRNA virus) prefers codons ending in G while its genome contains only 22.7% G (Zhang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Various explanations have been proposed for the observed codon usage of HAV. Vaughan and coworkers proposed that it slows down translation of proteins, resulting in better competition for loaded tRNAs during translation of virus proteins against that of host proteins (Vaughan et al., 2014). However, most variation is in the third\u2010base wobble, in which case there would be little selection for less commonly used tRNAs and amino\u2010acyltransferases. Nevertheless, nonpreferred third bases can slow down the translation machinery, which presumably allows better protein folding of the capsid protein (Pint\u00f3 et al., 2018). Costafreda and coworkers have shown that selection for deoptimized HAV codons was related to transcription efficiency, antigenicity of capsid protein, plaque size, and survival rates of virions (Costafreda et al., 2014). However, it is hard to envisage how this situation might have evolved when an ancestor of HAV had a codon usage that was better adapted to the mammalian host. In general, the direction of virus evolution would be toward more efficient, not toward less efficient translation and replication in a given host, as it would result in more (or more rapid) virion production. Moreover, if the selective pressure would mostly apply to optimal folding of the capsid protein, only that coding region of the genome would depend on using deoptimized codons, but the virus proteome is consistently using codons that human cells do not prefer, over its complete ORF length This is shown in Appendix Figure A2. We consider the most likely explanation for the current codon usage of HAV that it is a remnant of an ancestor virus that replicated in a host with a codon usage preference different to that of humans.",

The codon usage in simian HAV (genotype V) strongly resembles that of human HAV, as do rodent hepatoviral species (Appendix Figure A3 panel a). Since Dexler and colleagues had proposed that rodent HAV species may have originated from an ancestor replicating in bats, we further assessed the codon usage of hepatovirus from bat species. Two of the currently 7 available genome sequences of bat hepatovirus were selected, one from a fruit\u2010eating bat and one from an insectivore species (Table 1). The latter (African sheath\u2010tailed bat) is widespread in Africa and prefers a diet of beetles and lepidopterans (McWilliam, 1987). Both investigated bat hepatovirus species had a codon usage extremely similar to that of the other analyzed hepatovirus species (Figure A3 panel a). Thus, possibly the selection mechanism proposed for HAV that resulted in de\u2010optimized codon use for its human host also applies to these other hepatoviruses that replicate in other mammalian hosts.",

When we compared codon usage of HAV to that of these two viral species, a striking similarity was observed. In particular, the codon use of triatoma virus is highly similar to that of HAV (Figure 3) and that similarity is higher than that of HAV to CrPV or to the tested potential bacterial hosts. Figure 3c further demonstrates that the codon usage of triatoma virus is well adapted to its natural insect host, Triatoma infestans.",

The insect virus species varied from 45.0 (triatoma virus) to 52.6 (cricket paralysis virus). The highest score was reported for norovirus (58.3) and the lowest for rodent hepatovirus (43.1).

That ancestor might have been an insect virus that underwent a host jump to bats, after it was passed on to rodents and eventually simians and humans. The jump from insect to bat may have occurred in the blood (in case a blood\u2010sucking insect was the source) or in the gut of insectivorous bats. A candidate for this putative common ancestor has not been identified, as no invertebrate virus is yet described with sequence similarity to HAV, but its existence can be hypothesized. In contrast, HEV and HCV seem to have a common ancestor not related to that of HAV and form a different group of (human) ssRNA(+) virus species that includes Zika virus, HPgV, and WNV, while a striking resemblance between HEV and HCV for all analyzed parameters is observed. An alternative explanation for the observed similarities is that the various virus species found to share the identified features with virus species of different taxonomic families have undergone parallel evolution that drove these species toward identical amino acid frequencies and conserved codon use, even if (as in the case of human vs. insect viruses) their hosts have alternative codon preferences. We consider that second possibility less likely.",

We consider it possible that a blood\u2010sucking insect such as triatomes, which feeds on mammals, may have been the source for a virus crossing host species. Alternatively, a host jump may have taken place in the gut of insectivorous bats. More speculative is the possibility that in a long evolutionary past all these virus species may have originated from bacteriophages that propagated in Gram\u2010negative AT\u2010rich bacteria, with which they still share codon preference and amino acid frequency.",
