Extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection notably involve the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, heart, joints, skin, and blood cells. Especially, gastrointestinal manifestations account for 25% of M. pneumoniae infections, which produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. However, acute pancreatitis is rarely associated with M. pneumoniae infection, with scarce reports and studies in literature [12345]. We report the first case in Korea of a child with acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with M. pneumoniae infection.",

Electrolyte and biochemistry laboratory exams showed abnormal levels of sodium decreased to 123 mEg/L, and elevation of amylase to 1,570 U/L, lipase to 2,860 U/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) to 12.73 mg/dL, and procalcitonin to 0.54 ng/mL. Coagulation studies revealed normal activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen levels, while prothrombin time was elevated to 16.9 seconds (normal range, 12.6 to 14.9 seconds), and D-dimer to 20.49 \u00b5g/mL (normal range, 0 to 0.5 \u00b5g/mL). Antithrombin III activity was decreased to 73% (normal range, 83% to 123%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory viruses including adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus were all negative. Initial serum antibody titers to M. pneumoniae detected by particle agglutination antibody assay was 1:5,120, and serum antibody titers to M. pneumoniae detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 46.5 AU/mL for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and 1.8 index value (ratio between the absorbance value of the test sample and that of the cut-off) for IgM. Serum antibody and PCR tests to rule out other possible infectious causes, such as mumps virus, measles virus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, leptospira, aspergillus, and toxoplasma were all unremarkable. Abdominal CT scans revealed necrosis of the pancreas body and tail and a portal vein thrombus of 2 cm was observed in the main portal vein (Fig. 1). Bilateral pleural effusions were also observed on CT scans. Modified CT severity index was 10 (grade E, necrosis >50%), and severe acute pancreatitis was apparent according to the revised Atlanta classification [6].",

Intravenous gabexate mesylate and meropenem were also commenced on the first hospital day. Intravenous clarithromycin was added on the second hospital day under the presumption that her necrotizing pancreatitis was associated with M. pneumoniae infection. Her mental status gradually improved to alert during correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. However, fever persisted despite intravenous antibiotic therapy with meropenem and clarithromycin. Moreover, ascites and pleural effusion was observed on the third hospital day, and therefore paracentesis was performed. On the seventh hospital day, a 10\u00d74.8\u00d722 cm region of an infected pseudocyst was newly observed on CT scans of the abdomen (Fig. 2). A percutaneous catheter was inserted for drainage, and on the eleventh hospital day fever subsided with subsequent improvement of her general condition. Laboratory exams performed on the nineteenth day showed a WBC count of 7,000/mm3, comprising 62.8% neutrophils, 18.4% lymphocytes, and 9.3% monocytes, and platelet count of 354\u00d7103/mm3. Amylase level had decreased to 54.9 U/L, lipase to 47.2 U/L and CRP level to 0.65 mg/dL. Other laboratory tests including chemistry, electrolytes, and coagulation studies were all normal.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children has increased significantly in the past two decades. It is estimated that 2 to 13 new cases occur annually per 100,000 children in the pediatric population [7]. The major etiologic factors of acute pancreatitis are biliary diseases, complications from medications, systemic diseases, systemic infections, trauma, and organ transplant in the pediatric population [891011]. Although infectious causes are quite rare in the development of acute pancreatitis, mumps virus, measles virus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, rotavirus, influenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma, Salmonella, and some gram-negative bacteria are known as pathogens associated with acute pancreatitis [12].",

Second, M. pneumoniae-phagocytosed macrophages are capable of presenting glycoproteins and glycolipids to the cell surface causing modulation of the immune system, leading to indirect-type extrapulmonary manifestations. Third, during the infection with M. pneumoniae, vasculitis and/or thrombosis with or without a systemic hypercoagulable state is capable of inducing vascular occlusion type extrapulmonary manifestations. Necrosis of the pancreas in our case may have been induced by vasculitis of the pancreatitis, according to the patient's status of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, portal vein thrombosis was detected on the initial abdominal CT scan. These findings suggest that the underlying pathomechanism of M. pneumoniae infection associated with acute pancreatitis may be related to the vascular occlusion type mechanism with a systemic hypercoagulable state.",

            "text": "In the majority of cases, acute pancreatitis does not result in severe complications in children. Severe pancreatitis is rare and is usually the result of pancreatic glandular necrosis. Necrotizing pancreatitis occurs in <1% of children with acute pancreatitis [13]. The overall mortality of acute pancreatitis is about 5% and can reach 20-30% in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and infected necrosis [1415]. A recent study has reported the variable etiology, clinical course, and outcome of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in seven children [11]. Etiologic factors-were medications, diabetes, and gallstones. All seven patients required prolonged hospitalization and five-patients required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. All patients received aggressive supportive medical therapy, and none required surgery. There were no deaths but late complications after hospital discharge occurred in five patients which included pseudocysts, transient hyperglycemia, diabetes, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The results of this study and our case highlights the need for aggressive supportive medical therapy and prolonged hospital stay for children with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Also, close follow-up is required for the detection of possible delayed complications.",

            "text": "The basic concept of treatment in acute necrotizing pancreatitis is not greatly different from that of acute pancreatitis without necrosis. Restriction of oral feeding, adequate supplementation of fluid and electrolytes, enzyme inhibition therapy, pain relievers, and infection prevention are fundamentally required. Rapid and accurate initial assessment of the severity of necrotizing pancreatitis is also important, as some patients should be managed in an intensive care unit and may need a longer hospital stay. In patients with severely infected pancreatic necrosis, surgical drainage and pancreatectomy may be indicated [121617]. According to a recent report, treatment with gabexate mesilate infused continuously via catheterization of a regional artery of the pancreas was effective in a pediatric case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis caused by M. pneumoniae infection [5]. Gabexate mesilate is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor and is used to prevent or treat acute pancreatitis [18]. In an animal study, it was shown to decrease serum lipase levels, reduce the severity of the pancreatic pathology, and improve pancreatic microcirculation in rats [19]. According to the results of a meta-anlaysis, gabexate mesilate was shown to only reduce the mortality in patients with moderate to severe pancreatitis [20]. Additionally, it has been suggested that the efficacy of gabexate mesilate may differ according to the route of administration, such as intravenous or arterial infusion. The effect of early antibiotics and gabexate mesilate in our case is controversial. Despite early treatment with antibiotics and gabexate mesilate, fever persisted and an infected huge pseudocyst developed. Improvement of fever and laboratory exams were observed only after a percutaneous catheter was inserted for drainage. Therefore, close observation of possible complications and appropriate management according to the patient's clinical status is substantial in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis, adjoined to early primary treatments.",
