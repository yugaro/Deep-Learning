To mitigate this issue, enrichment and amplification approaches\nare widely used prior to sequencing viral samples. Size filtration or density-based\nenrichment by centrifugation are two effective methods for increasing virus yield,\nalthough such methods may bias the observed composition of viral populations (Ruby, Bellare, and Derisi 2013).\nAlternatively, PCR amplification may be used to generate an abundance of specific\nviral sequences present in a sample, a widely used strategy, which was employed in\nthe identification and analysis of MERS coronavirus (Zaki et al. 2012;\nCotten et al. 2013, 2014),\nalthough effective primer design can be challenging in the presence of high genomic\ndiversity in the target viral species. Conversely, an excess of sequencing coverage\ncan lead to the construction of overly complex and unwieldy de novo\nassembly graphs in the presence of high genomic diversity, reducing assembly\nquality. Using in silico normalisation (Crusoe et al. 2015), excess coverage may be reduced by\ndiscarding sequences containing redundant information. This approach increases\nanalytical efficiency when dealing with high coverage sequence data, and we have\nshown that it can benefit de novo assembly of viral consensus\nsequences. Another in silico strategy for increasing analytical\nefficiency by discarding unneeded data is to filter sequences from known abundant\norganisms through alignment with one or more reference genomes using an aligner or\nspecialist tool (approaches reviewed in Daly\net al. 2015).",

            "text": "There are several sequencing technologies in widespread use that are capable of\nreading hundreds of thousands to billions of DNA sequences per run (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). The\ncurrent market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating\nbillions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see \u2018Glossary\u2019) per run, with read\nlengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for\nanalyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing\ncoverage, enables sensitive characterization of low-frequency variation within viral\npopulations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al. 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable\nof generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a\nhigher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Eid et al. 2009). Single molecule real-time sequencing\ncommercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp)\nreads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the\nerrors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (\u223c10%) intrinsic\nerror rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent\nthroughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes\nthe pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule\nsequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are\ngenerated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the\nNanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina\n(Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015).\nHowever, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential\nto revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as\nenabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost\n(Feng et al. 2015; Quick et al. 2015; Hoenen et al. 2016). Hybrid sequencing strategies using\nboth long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive\nDNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads, at the expense\nof additional sequencing, library preparation and data analysis (Madoui et al. 2015).",

OLC assemblers use the\nsimilarity of whole reads in order to construct a graph wherein each read is\nrepresented by a node, and subsequently merge overlapping reads into consensus\ncontigs (Deng et al. 2015). OLC is\nrelatively time and memory intensive, scaling poorly to millions of reads and\nbeyond. However, the fewer, longer reads generated by emerging single molecule\nsequencing technologies tend to be well suited to OLC assembly, which can be\neasily implemented to tolerate long and noisy sequences (Compeau, Pevzner, and Tesler 2011).

De Bruijn graphs are much more efficient\nto construct than overlap graphs and are suited to large numbers of short reads,\nand where coverage is high, since redundant k-mers occupy\nnegligible random access memory (RAM).

            "text": "Typical de novo assemblers are designed to reconstruct genomes\nwith uniform sequencing coverage across their length. This is problematic for\nmetagenomes (including viromes) where coverage typically varies considerably\nboth among different genomes and within individual genomes. To address this\nproblem, dedicated metagenome assemblers have been developed. Omega (Haider et al. 2014) is an OLC-based\nmethod that uses a minimum cost flow analysis of the OLC graph to generate\ninitial contigs, merging these to create longer contigs and scaffolds using\nmate-pair information. Genovo (Laserson,\nJojic, and Koller 2011) is another OLC-based method that generates a\nprobabilistic model for the dataset and subsequently uses an iterative approach\nto reconstruct the most likely genome contigs. MEGAHIT (Li et al. 2015) prioritizes speed, leveraging a\nsuccinct de Bruijn graph to rapidly reconstruct high complexity metagenomes,\nsuch as those of soil or seawater, on a single computer. Noteworthy is the\niterative de Bruijn graph assembler SPAdes, which although not initially\nintended for metagenome assembly, has been widely adopted for its effectiveness\nin assembling variable coverage metagenomes of limited complexity. MetaSPAdes\n(Nurk et al. 2016) is a\nmetagenome-specific release of the SPAdes pipeline with refinements to its graph\nsimplification and repeat resolution algorithms, counter-intuitively capable of\nleveraging rare strain information so as to improve its consensus reconstruction\ncapabilities. Other de Bruijn graph metagenome assemblers based on their genomic\ncounterparts include Ray-Meta (Boisvert et\nal. 2012), MetAMOS (Treangen\net al. 2013), MetaVelvet (Namiki et al. 2012; Afiahayati, Sato, and Sakakibara 2015), and IDBA-UD (Peng et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Viral genomes and metagenomes comprising high intraspecific variation can be\nchallenging targets for assembly, giving rise to complex assembly graphs and\nfragmented assemblies. This is often the case for clinical samples from HIV and\nHepatitis C patients, in which high rates of mutation and long durations of\ninfection can contribute to extreme population divergence, but can also be observed\nin environmental samples. Where such diversity exists, alignment based probabilistic\npopulation reconstruction approaches can be effective, permitting the reconstruction\nof individual viral variants into \u2018haplotypes\u2019 exceeding read length. This problem\nhas been well studied, and tools such as ShoRAH, QuRE, and PredictHaplo (Giallonardo et al. 2014) are designed\nfor haplotyping viral populations. ShoRAH (Zagordi et al. 2011) extracts local alignments of a specified window\nlength, reconstructs haplotypes for each \u2018cluster\u2019 in that window, and removes\nmutations from sequences in the cluster not matching the reconstructed haplotype\nusing a model-based probabilistic clustering algorithm. QuRe (Prosperi and Salemi 2012; Prosperi et al. 2013) removes nucleotide substitutions\nand indels with a Poisson model and reconstructs haplotypes using a heuristic\nalgorithm based on a multinomial distribution. Both approaches have the advantage of\nreporting probabilities for the reconstructed haplotypes. PredictHaplo is notable\nfor taking into account the read pairing information in Illumina data. A limitation\nof all of these approaches; however, is their reliance upon a single reference\nsequence with which to perform the initial alignment, a process which assumes a\ndegree of sequence similarity which may not always be observed in diverse regions,\nsuch as regions encoding envelope proteins, of RNA virus genomes. This can be\nmitigated through construction of a data-specific template through iterative\nreference mapping and consensus refinement strategies (Archer et al. 2010; B\u0159inda, Boeva, and Kucherov 2016). Other possibilities\nfor broader utility of these approaches include the use of multiple viral reference\nsequences, either through consideration of multiple linear sequences or by direct\nalignment of sequences to a variation graph [https://github.com/vgteam/vg], an emerging approach for modeling\ngenomic variation.",

Comprehensive databases (e.g. GenBank) or\nsmaller custom databases containing for example, only viral sequences of\ninterest may be used, although the latter can generate misleading results.\nProViDE (Ghosh et al. 2011) uses\nvirus-specific alignment parameters and thresholds to assign viruses at\ndifferent taxonomic levels from BLAST matches to a protein database. VIROME\n(Wommack et al. 2012) is a\nmultifaceted tool integrating results from searches of several sequence and\nfunction databases. MEGAN (Huson et al.\n2011) is a generally applicable metagenomic classifier, which uses\nBLAST results to infer the LCA for a given sequence and provides functional\nanalyses through a graphical interface. Automatic pipelines which combine\nvarious homology search strategies to identify a final set of viral reads\ninclude VirusHunter (Zhao et al.\n2013), a Perl script that automates viral identification using BLAST\nprior to assembly; MetaVir (Roux et al.\n2011), a web application that compares users\u2019 datasets to published\nviral sequences; and VirSorter (Roux et\nal. 2015), which identifies prophages and viruses by comparison with\ncustom datasets. With the exception of web applications, however, these are not\nintuitive tools for the majority of users, requiring manual configuration and\ninstallation of software dependencies. Furthermore, similarity search approaches\nare in general extremely resource-intensive, and performing sensitive BLAST-like\ndatabase searches with millions of reads is intractable without use of\nspecialist computational resources. To address this problem, tools have emerged\nleveraging optimized search algorithms and prebuilt databases so as to increase\nthe tractability of classifying millions of reads. For example, Kraken (Wood and Salzberg 2014) and Clark\n(Ounit et al. 2015) are fast\nexact k-mer matching approaches that use prebuilt databases of\nviruses, bacteria, human, and fungi, although custom databases may also be\nbuilt. One Codex is a proprietary web-based metagenome analysis platform with an\nintegrated fast k-mer matching engine (similar to that of\nKraken) which is both fast, very easy to use, and free for academic use (Minot,\nKrumm, and Greenfield). Lambda (Hauswedell, Singer, and Reinert 2014) and Diamond (Buchfink, Xie, and Huson 2015) are\nsensitive and heavily optimized BLAST-like aligners which leverage alphabet\nreduction to permit protein searches three to five orders of magnitude faster\nthan BLAST, offering prebuilt database indexes for common applications.",
