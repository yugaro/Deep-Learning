            "text": "For RNA virologists, the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late 1970s made it possible to convert viral RNA genomes into cDNA clones, which could then be propagated as plasmids in bacteria for the genetic manipulation of RNA viruses.1 The first RNA virus to be molecularly cloned was bacteriophage Q\u03b2, a positive-strand RNA virus that infects Escherichia coli. A plasmid containing a complete cDNA copy of the Q\u03b2 genomic RNA gave rise to infectious Q\u03b2 phages when introduced into E. coli.2 Shortly thereafter, this technique was applied to poliovirus, a positive-strand RNA virus of humans and animals. A plasmid bearing a full-length cDNA of the poliovirus genomic RNA was infectious when transfected into mammalian cells and capable of producing infectious virions.3 In this \"DNA-launched\" approach, the cloned cDNAs should be transcribed intracellularly to initiate viral RNA replication; however, it is unclear how the transcription is initiated and how the transcripts are processed to the correct viral sequence. This concern has led to the development of an alternative \"RNA-launched\" approach, whereby a complete cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome is cloned under a promoter recognized by an E. coli or phage RNA polymerase for the production of synthetic RNAs in vitro with defined 5' and 3' termini, which undergo the complete viral replication cycle when introduced into host cells.4,5 The first success with this approach was reported for brome mosaic virus,6,7 a positive-strand RNA virus of plants. Since then, the RNA-launched approach has been developed for a wide range of positive-strand RNA viruses, including caliciviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, arteriviruses, and coronaviruses.1,4,5,8",

The second hurdle is the presence of potentially toxic sequences, since long RNA molecules are more likely to contain unexpected sequences capable of making the cDNA fragment in plasmids unstable in E. coli. The third and most critical issue is the availability of a suitable vector, since it is difficult to find a cloning vector that can house a viral cDNA insert of >10 kb. Over the past three decades, these barriers have been overcome by several advances in enzymology, methodology, and vectorology.1,4,5,8 Of these, the most promising and innovative development is the cloning of large positive-strand RNA viruses as infectious bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). The BAC vector is a low-copy cloning plasmid (1-2 copies/cell) based on the E. coli fertility factor, with an average DNA insert size of ~120-350 kb.19-21 A DNA fragment is inserted into the BAC vector in a similar fashion to cloning into general cloning vectors; the resulting BAC clones are stable over many generations in E. coli.22,23 To date, the BAC technology has been used to create infectious cDNA clones for >10 members of three positive-strand RNA virus families, i.e., Flaviviridae,24-29Arteriviridae,30 and Coronaviridae.9,16,17,31,32",

This gel demonstrates clearly that a full-length JEV cDNA is amplified into four overlapping cDNA fragments. Occasionally, RT-PCR reactions might yield one or more additional virus-specific or nonspecific products that are mostly smaller than the expected product, because of the nonspecific annealing of primers during cDNA synthesis/amplification.

In this experiment, after centrifugation for 16 hr at 401,700 \u00d7 g, two distinct bands, i.e., the E. coli chromosomal DNA above and the supercoiled BAC plasmid DNA below, are visible in the middle of the tube under long-wave ultraviolet light.

This step involves three sequential steps: Step 1, linearization of the full-length SA14-14-2 cDNA at the 3'-end of the viral genome (Figure 4A); Step 2, production of synthetic RNAs from the linearized cDNA by run-off transcription (Figure 4B); and Step 3, rescue of the recombinant viruses in BHK-21 cells transfected with the synthetic RNAs (Figure 4C). Experimentally, two independent clones of pBAC/SA14-14-2 were linearized with Xba I digestion and treated with MBN to remove the four-base 5' overhang generated by the Xba I digestion. The linearized BACs were cleaned up by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The linearization of the two purified BACs was demonstrated on a 0.8% agarose gel (Figure 5A). The phenol-chloroform extraction must be done carefully to ensure that the linearized BACs are RNase-free. Each of the two linearized BACs served as a cDNA template for run-off transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of the m7G(5')ppp(5')A cap analog. The integrity of the synthetic RNAs was shown by running aliquots of the two transcription reaction mixtures on a 0.6% agarose gel, along with a reference 1 kb DNA ladder (Figure 5B). In this simple assay, the major prominent RNA band always migrated just below the 3 kb reference DNA band and appeared to be sharp. However, degraded RNA would have a smeared appearance on the same gel.",

After incubation for 4 days, surviving cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with a crystal violet solution to quantify the number of infectious centers (plaques), which corresponds to the number of infectious RNA molecules delivered into the cells (Figure 6A). Since the cDNA template used for in vitro transcription has been proven to be non-infectious,27 an aliquot of the transcription reaction mixture was directly used for electroporation. Electroporation is the preferred method for RNA transfection; alternatively, RNAs can be transfected by other methods using DEAE-dextran and cationic liposomes. RNA electroporation is very effective, but \"arcing\" of the electric pulse occurs rarely if salts are present in the electroporation reaction or if the electroporation cuvette is reused. The expression of viral proteins in RNA-transfected cells was examined by immunofluorescence assays using an anti-NS1 rabbit antiserum (Figure 6B). The production of viral particles accumulated in the supernatants of RNA-transfected cells was analyzed by plaque assays (Figure 6C). The results of these experiments show clearly that the cDNA-derived synthetic RNAs are infectious in permissive BHK-21 cells, generating a high titer of recombinant viruses.",

This cloning approach will be generally applicable to many other positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a large RNA genome of ~10 to 32 kb. Generation of an infectious cDNA clone is a key step in developing a reverse genetics system for RNA viruses, especially for positive-strand RNA viruses, because its genome acts as viral mRNA that is translated into proteins by host cell ribosomes. Thus, viral replication can be initiated by the introduction of a cDNA-derived genome-length RNA molecule into a susceptible host cell. The availability of an infectious JEV cDNA clone, when combined with recombinant DNA technology, has increased our understanding of various aspects of the viral life cycle at the molecular level, such as gene expression73,79 and genome replication.63,64 Also, a full-length JEV cDNA clone has proven to be a valuable tool for the development of antiviral vaccines28 and gene delivery vectors.80,81",

Ideally, the sequence of the synthetic RNAs transcribed from a clone of the full-length cDNA should be identical to that of the viral genomic RNA, particularly the 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences that are required for the initiation of viral RNA replication.60-62 In the current protocol, the authentic 5'- and 3'-ends were ensured by placing the SP6 promoter sequence upstream of the first adenine nucleotide of the viral genome and positioning a unique artificial Xba I restriction site downstream of the last thymine nucleotide of the viral genome, respectively. Capped synthetic RNAs with the authentic 5' and 3' ends were produced by run-off transcription of an Xba I-linearized and MBN-treated cDNA template using SP6 RNA polymerase primed with the m7G(5')ppp(5')A cap analog. This protocol can be modified in several ways. For in vitro transcription, another bacteriophage RNA polymerase (e.g., T3 or T7) can be used in conjunction with its well-defined promoter sequence.27 As a run-off site, a different restriction site can be utilized if it is not present in the viral genome and if synthetic RNA from the linearized cDNA ends with the authentic 3' end. The importance of the 3'-end nucleotide sequence has been demonstrated by a ~10-fold decrease in RNA infectivity when a synthetic RNA contains three or four virus-unrelated nucleotides at its 3' end.27 In an in vitro transcription reaction, both the m7G(5')ppp(5')A and m7G(5')ppp(5')G cap analog can be used equally well, although the latter places an unrelated extra G nucleotide upstream of the viral 5'-end, but that addition does not alter the infectivity or replication of synthetic RNA.27 Moreover, removal of the cDNA template from the RNA transcripts by DNase I digestion is not necessary for RNA infectivity tests, because the cDNA template itself is not infectious.27",

In the current protocol, the yield of BAC DNA is maximized by growing E. coli DH10B transformed with the infectious BAC pBAC/SA14-14-2 in a nutrient-rich medium, 2xYT. Despite this effort, the average yield is only ~15 \u00b5g of BAC DNA from 500 ml of 2xYT broth. Also, the purity of the BAC DNA is best achieved by using CsCl-EtBr density gradient centrifugation for purification, rather than the commonly used column-based plasmid isolation. However, it is important to keep in mind that the BAC-transformed E. coli should not overgrow because it might jeopardize the genetic stability of the cloned cDNA, and higher growth does not necessarily lead to greater yields or higher-purity BAC DNA.",

In addition, this infectious cDNA technology can also be utilized as a viral vector, capable of expressing a foreign gene(s) of interest for many applications in biomedical research.",
