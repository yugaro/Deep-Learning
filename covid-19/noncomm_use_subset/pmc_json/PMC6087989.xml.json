            "text": "Pneumonia, an infection of the lung due to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens, is a\nsignificant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past few decades, the\nthreat of emerging pathogens presenting as pneumonia, such as Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and Middle East\nRespiratory Syndrome coronavirus has emphasised the importance of the surveillance\nof pneumonia and other severe respiratory infections. An unexpected increase in the\nnumber of hospital admissions for pneumonia or severe respiratory infections could\nbe a signal of a change in the virulence of the influenza viruses or other\nrespiratory pathogens circulating in the community, or an alert of an emerging\npathogen which warrants further public health investigation. The purpose of this\nstudy was to develop a forecasting model to prospectively forecast the number of\nemergency department (ED) admissions due to pneumonia in Singapore, a tropical\ncountry. We hypothesise that there is complementary information between\nhospital-based and community-based surveillance systems. The clinical spectrum of\nmany respiratory pathogens causing pneumonia ranges from asymptomatic or subclinical\ninfection to severe or fatal pneumonia, and it is usually difficult to distinguish\nbetween the different pathogens in the absence of a laboratory test. Infected\npersons could present with varying degrees of severity of the infection, and seek\ntreatment at different healthcare facilities. Hospital-based surveillance captures\nthe more severe manifestation of the infection while community-based surveillance\ncaptures the less severe manifestation of the infection and enables earlier\ndetection of the infection. Thus, the integration of information from the two\nsurveillance systems should improve the prospective forecasting of ED admissions due\nto pneumonia. We also investigate if the inclusion of influenza data from the\nlaboratory surveillance system would improve the forecasting model, since influenza\ncirculates all-year round in Singapore and is a common aetiology for pneumonia.",
