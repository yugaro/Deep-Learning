In Saudi Arabia 31.8% of the patient suffering from liver problems are using herbs in addition to the prescribed drugs (Al-Zahim et al., 2013). Our previous studies on the hepatoprotactive effect of Junipers species showed promising results (Alqasoumi et al., 2009, Abdel-Kader et al., 2009, Abdel-Kader et al., 2017). Both J. phoenicea and J. procera were subjected to detailed phytochemical study directed by hepatoprotective activity resulted in the identification of the bioflavonoid hinokiflavone (HF) (Fig. 1), 4-epi-abietol and sugiol as the most active components (Alqasoumi and Abdel-Kader, 2012a, Alqasoumi et al., 2013). In addition, HF reported to express potent inhibitory activity on dengue 2 NS5 polymerase (Coulerie et al., 2012). HF displayed HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), influenza A and B virus sialidase inhibitory activity (Lin et al., 1997, Miki et al., 2008). HF potentiated the antibiotic activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus by targeting RecA (Cottarel et al., 2007). Among 65 flavonoids, HF was the most active to inhibit the procoagulant activity of adherent human monocytes stimulated by endotoxin and interleukin-1b in vitro (Lale et al., 1996).",

GL containing preparation prevents hepatic steatosis possibly by protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress induced by HCV proteins and iron overload (Korenaga et al., 2011). GL was found to inhibit the replication of the SARS-associated virus (Cinatl et al., 2003). In the treatment of HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection, GL can inhibit HCV full-length viral particles and HCV core gene expression or function in a dose-dependent manner and have a synergistic effect with interferon (Ashfaq et al., 2011). GL and omega-3 fatty acids combination protected the liver from TAA hepatotoxic effects as indicated from biochemical and histopathological parameters. GL and omega-3 fatty acids combination showed potent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic effects (Abo El-Magd et al., 2015).",

Lipid peroxidation increase endoplasmic reticulum and other membranes permeability to Ca2+ resulting in a severe disturbances of calcium homeostasis and consequently necrotic cell death (Weber et al., 2003). Significant increase in the levels of transaminases (AST and ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin were observed in the control group treated with CCl4 (Table 1).

SI have scavenging ability against prooxidant free radicals. In addition, it increases the intracellular concentration of GSH. SI restores the cellular membrane permeability and increases its stability against xenobiotics injury; increases the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and stimulates protein synthesis to regenerate liver cells (Saller et al., 2007, Dehmlow et al., 1996).

The comparison based on serum biochemical parameters, tissue parameters, histological study using light and electron microscope. The combinations were more effective than HF and GL alone. However, SI was superior to the used combination in the two used doses in all the measured parameters. The liver and kidney cells appearance under normal and electron microscope showed that SI treated groups showed almost normal cells with slight toxic signs. Cells from group treated with combination of 12 mg HF, 84 mg GL/kg body weight indicated resemblance to the normal group pictures of both kidney and liver under light microscope. Electron microscope showed little cellular deterioration with some accumulation of small electro-dense materials. Although the combination of HF and GL expressed good protection in the higher dose, however, the combination did not exceed the protective effect of SI.",
