The SARS lungs were, on average, three to four times heavier than normal lungs. Conventional light microscopy (LM) demonstrated widespread damage of the lung parenchyma, with extensive fibrin exudate, edema, interstitial thickening, and extensive hyaline membrane formation (Fig. 1 B). There was extensive alveolar collapse, and the remaining alveoli were filled with fluid and desquamated alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was evident. Large syncytial cells with multiple nuclei were present. Small vessel vasculitis was seen. However, cellular infiltrate was rare and conspicuously absent in most cases, and lymphocytic infiltration was sparse. Overall, the diffuse alveolar damage resembled that seen in adult respiratory distress syndrome, but with a paucity of inflammatory infiltrate.",

Monocytes and lymphocytes in blood vessels of the lungs also were positive for in situ hybridization (Fig. 1 E). Negative control for in situ hybridization of SARS genomic sequence of the lung showed no positive signal when an unrelated probe was used (Fig. 1 F). EM demonstrated SARS-like viral particles in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells (Fig. 1, H and I). In situ hybridization with specific probes, and colloid gold-labeled secondary antibodies detected specific positive signals in the cytoplasm of epithelial cell types I and II at the EM level (Fig. 1 G). Double labeling of SARS-infected cells with in situ hybridization and cytokeratin immunolabeling revealed that pulmonary epithelial cells were infected by SARS virus.

These round viral particles, with diameters of 80\u2013120 nm, were located in the cytoplasm. The particles had double membranes and pale cores with short processes that projected outward. The percentage of total circulating lymphocytes was decreased (Table I). The percentages of different cell types that harbored SARS-like viral particles are shown in Table II. Positive samples included those taken within 10 d of the onset of fever, and in one instance as early as 3 d. Most of the infected cells were T cells. Some B cells and NK cells also were infected by the virus. By EM, the viral particles tended to form clusters and were located within or near the endoplasmic reticulum. T lymphocytes were identified by their unique morphology with a size of \u223c8\u201315 \u03bcm in diameter; round shape with irregular cell membranes and small villous processes; large rounded, but sometimes, irregular nucleus; and small quantities of cytoplasm devoid of lysosomes. Labeling of these cells with antibody to CD3 and pre-embedding immunoperoxidase labeling for EM further confirmed the nature of these cells. The macrophages appeared to be activated as they became slightly larger. The nature of these cells was confirmed with immunohistochemistry of CD68.",

Immunolabeling with seven markers was undertaken to identify seven cell types (Table III). All immune cell types, including dendritic cells, were decreased significantly (P < 0.01), and CD68 positive macrophages, which were decreased in number, were noticeably (P < 0.01) increased in size and gave the impression of macrophage activation (Fig. 2, D and E). In the negative control for immunohistochemistry of spleens from confirmed SARS patients in which PBS was substituted for the anti-CD68 antibody, no positive signal was detected (Fig. 2 F). In situ hybridization identified the SARS viral sequence in the enlarged macrophages and in the isolated and sometimes clustered T lymphocytes, which were distributed mostly at the periphery of the germinal centers of the splenic white pulp, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood (Fig. 1 E; Fig. 2 G, H, J, and M).",

In three cases, the pathologic changes in the lungs were similar to those seen in the confirmed cases of SARS. However, the edema, consolidation, hyaline membrane formation, and fibrosis were less prominent, and there was no damage to the pulmonary epithelial cells. Multiple organ infection was a characteristic feature for confirmed cases of SARS, but not for the other patients.

The SARS virus enters the body through the respiratory tract and first infects the epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. The virus infects resident, infiltrating, and circulating immune cells. The circulating immune cells carry the virus to other organs. The virus infects and damages the immune cells of the spleen, peripheral and central lymph nodes, and other lymphoid tissues. The immune defense is weakened significantly, which leads to rapid deterioration of the pneumonia. In the same manner, the blood-borne SARS virus infects other organs. As such, patients who have compromised immune function, such as those who have chronic diseases and aged individuals, suffer a more severe illness and have a much higher mortality from SARS (15). The extent of immune cell damage, reflected by lymphocyte count, is a manifestation of the patient's immune status and a predictor of outcome. The damage to the immune system, more than damage to the lungs, determines whether a patient recovers or dies from the infection. In a way, the name \u201csudden acute respiratory syndrome\u201d is inappropriate because it diverts attention from the primary pathologic changes that result from SARS virus infection. It must be emphasized that immune damage most likely is the primary determinant of clinical outcome.",

Our proposed mechanism of infection and dissemination is capable of explaining all of the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings that have been reported for SARS. It provides a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis for this new disease. In a way, SARS infection is similar to HIV infection that causes AIDS. Although HIV attacks and destroys the target cells slowly, particularly lymphocytes (24), SARS virus infects and destroys the immune cells in a much faster and more devastating fashion. Like many other infectious diseases, SARS infections show differing degrees of severity in different individuals. Only the most severe cases demonstrate the full range of pathologic changes that was described above. Our findings suggest that body fluid and fecal\u2013respiratory tract transmission of the virus, although not reported, is possible because SARS viruses or its sequences are detectable in the blood, intestines, stool, and urine. A correct understanding of the pathogenesis is crucial for developing animal models to test effective vaccines and to establish techniques for early diagnosis.

The technique of in situ hybridization was based on Zhang et al. (28). In brief, a sequence of 154 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the SARS coronavirus genome sequence. These sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AY274119. The RNA probe was prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP. The in situ hybridization reaction was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the SARS probe at 50 \u03bcg/ml. The hybridization cocktail was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 16 h. The alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody (1:500) was incubated for 60 min, and colorization was achieved with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and counterstained with methyl-green. Immunoelectron microscopy was based on the technique of Goldsmith et al. (29). The EM in situ hybridization technique was based on Vandell et al. (26). In brief, the in situ hybridization reaction was performed on the tissue grids in a procedure similar to that for the LM. The labeled probe was detected with colloidal gold (10 nm)\u2013labeled antibody to digoxigenin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a range of monoclonal antibodies to identify the different cell types that were infected or affected by the virus (Table I). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described by Lin et al. (30), and antigen retrieval technique was performed as described previously (31, 32). Real time RT-PCR was performed with the technique of Wu et al. (33). In brief, total RNA was extracted from clinical samples using Trizol reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA with the superscript first-strand cDNA synthesis system. Taqman real-time quantitative PCR was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Three pairs of primers were designed and constructed (Genbank G130027616 [15121\u201315661]). The designs of the primers and the probes that were used for real-time PCR and in situ hybridization were those described previously (33). They were 5\u2032-GCGCAAGTATTAAGTGAGATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAAGTGCATTTACATTGGCTA-3\u2032 as the innermost pair; 5\u2032-ACACTTGCTGTAACTTATCAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCATAGAGCCTGTGTGTGAGG-3\u2032 as the outer pair; and 5\u2032-CTAACATGCTTAGGATAATGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGGTAAGCGTAACTTATCAC-3\u2032 as the outermost pair. The molecular beacon technique was used (33). The sensitivity and specificity of this standardized real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV in postmortem lung tissues were established previously (34).",

When the two signals are present in the same cell, the staining changes to a purplish color, which is easily distinguishable from either of the primary colors. In addition, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed separately on consecutive sections to analyze the relationship between in situ hybridization signals and immunostaining signals to ascertain the cell types that were infected by the virus. Seven cell marker antigens were examined to identify epithelial cells, macrophages, T cells, B cells, and splenic dendritic cells.
