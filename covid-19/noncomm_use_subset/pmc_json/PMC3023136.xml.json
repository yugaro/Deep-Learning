The cases ranged from mild disease with rapid viral clearance within a few days after onset of symptoms to severe cases that shed virus for several weeks and required hospitalization with ventilator support. A majority of the patients were treated with antiviral drugs. The diagnoses were confirmed by pandemic H1N1-specific RT-PCR and serology. All patients had neutralizing titers of serum antibodies at the time of blood collection. A summary of the clinical patient data are shown in Table I. The majority of samples were obtained around 10 d after the onset of symptoms, with the exception of a particularly severe case where sampling was done 31 d after symptom onset.",

Here, we have analyzed the magnitude and specificity of the plasmablast response in blood samples taken within weeks after onset of clinical symptoms of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection. Using a virus-specific ELISPOT assay, it was possible to show a significant number of pandemic H1N1-reactive plasmablasts in the blood of the infected patients, whereas none were detectable in a cohort of healthy volunteers (Fig. 1, A and B). These cells were also readily detectable several weeks after symptom onset in the more severe cases. Fig. 1 (A and C) illustrates that, of the total IgG-secreting cells, over half of the cells were producing antibodies that bound pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, plasmablasts specific for HA occurred at 30\u201350% the frequency of virus-specific cells (Fig. 1, C and D), the specificity most likely to be critical for protection. Most patients also had a relatively high frequency of plasmablasts, forming antibodies that bound to past, seasonal influenza strains (Fig. 1 C) or recombinant HA from the previous annual H1N1 strain, A/Brisbane/59/2007. Based on the overall frequency of pandemic H1N1-specific cells, it is likely that the cells binding other strains were overlapping populations and cross-reactive. None of the induced plasmablast cells bound to recombinant HA from the H3N2 strain from the same vaccine (A/Brisbane/10/2007). These findings demonstrate that influenza-specific human plasmablasts are continuously generated throughout an ongoing infection and that a fairly high proportion of these cells make antibodies that also cross-react with previous annual H1N1 influenza strains.",

These genes were cloned and expressed as mAbs in 293 cells, and the antibodies were screened for reactivity by ELISA. Thresholds for scoring antibodies as specific to the influenza antigens were empirically determined based on being two standard deviations greater than the background level of binding evident from 48 naive B cell antibodies (Fig. S1 A). Of 86 antibodies generated in this fashion, 46 (53%) bound pandemic H1N1 (Fig. 1 F) and one third (15 antibodies) were reactive to HA (Fig. 1 G and Fig. S2 A), most of them at sub-nanomolar avidities (based on surface plasmon resonance analyses; Fig. S2 B). On a per donor basis, 55% of the mAbs bound to purified pandemic H1N1 virions (range: 33 to 77%). Of the virus-specific antibodies, 31% bound to recombinant HA (range: 14 to 55%). We conclude that virus-specific plasmablasts are readily detected after pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection and that virus-specific human mAbs can be efficiently generated from these cells.",

Consistent with the frequency of plasmablasts secreting antibodies binding annual influenza strains by ELISPOT analyses (Fig. 1 C), a majority (29/46, or 63%) of the pandemic H1N1-specific antibodies also cross-reacted with seasonal influenza viruses (Fig. 2, A and B). In fact, by ELISA, one third of these antibodies bind to the prepandemic strains at lower concentrations than they did to the pandemic H1N1 strain, suggesting higher avidity binding. By comparison, only 22% (11/50) of plasmablasts induced by annual H1N1 strains before the pandemic could bind the pandemic H1N1 influenza (Fig. S1 B). We propose that the cross-reactivity of pandemic H1N1-induced cells derives from the activation of memory cells originally specific for past influenza immunizations in an original antigenic sin fashion.",

The ready detection of clonal expansions at a mean frequency of 16.5% of the cells for the six patients supports this view (based on CDR3 sequence similarity; Fig. 2 C). Since the discovery of somatic mutation, it has been appreciated that mutations progressively accumulate on variable genes after repeated immunizations (McKean et al., 1984). Thus, we can gain insight into the origin of the pandemic H1N1 response by comparing the somatic mutation frequency of the plasmablasts present during H1N1 infection to that of other plasmablast responses. The PCR strategy allowed isolation of either IgG or IgA transcripts and identified 68% IgG and 32% IgA plasmablasts from the patients. Similar to plasmablasts induced by annual vaccination (Wrammert et al., 2008), or after a fourth booster vaccine to anthrax, the variable genes of novel H1N1-induced cells from five of the six patients harbored high numbers of somatic mutations (averaging >19 per patient; Fig. 2 D and Fig. S3 A). For these 5 patients, mutations had accumulated significantly more than from primary IgG plasmablast responses to anthrax or vaccinia (small pox) vaccines, and more so than for IgG-positive memory B cells from our historical data that averaged 14/VH gene (Student\u2019s t test P < 0.05; Zheng et al., 2004, 2005; Koelsch et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008; Fig. 2 C and Fig. S3 B) or from 347 IgG memory cell sequences previously published by another group (averaging 15/VH gene; de Wildt et al., 2000). Interestingly, for patient EM (outlier in Fig. 2 D) who had the most severe infection (Table I), mutations had accumulated at a significantly lower frequency than the IgG controls (Fig. S3 A; P < 0.0001), suggesting a unique circumstance such as a low-level or lacking primary response. Detailed sequence characteristics for pandemic H1N1-induced plasmablasts are provided in Tables S1\u2013S3. Though based on a limited number of patients, the frequent cross-reactivity and high number of somatic mutations support a model in which many of the plasmablasts induced by pandemic H1N1 infection arose from cross-reacting memory B cells.",

            "text": "A high frequency of the HA-specific antibodies was able to neutralize the virus in vitro (totaling 73% or 11/15; Fig. 3 A). These neutralizing antibodies could be further categorized into two distinct groups: (a) neutralizing antibodies that displayed hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity (HAI+) and (b) neutralizing antibodies that had no HAI activity, indicating that they bound to sites other than the HA active site. Interestingly, antibodies of the latter type were predominant in the response (Fig. 3 A). This specificity is reminiscent of antibodies against the recently discovered broadly neutralizing epitopes found on the HA stalk, rather than those located on the HA globular head that is more typical for neutralizing antibodies (Ekiert et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009). Importantly, five of these antibodies are indeed of similar specificity (including antibodies 70-5B03, 70-1F02, 1000-3D04, and a clonal pair from donor 1009: 3B05 and 3E06). These five antibodies bind with high affinity to most H1 strains including all from the vaccines of the past 10 yr, the 1918 pandemic strain, and to the H5 of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain (Fig. 3 B and Fig. S2 A). In addition, these five antibodies cross-compete for a similar epitope that was not over-lapping with the HAI+ antibodies (Fig. 4 A, epitope-1). These antibodies are competitively inhibited by a commercial antibody referred to as C179 that binds this HA stalk region (Okuno et al., 1993), and four of five of these antibodies are encoded by the hallmark VH1-69 gene (Ekiert et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009). To verify HA stalk reactivity, these five antibodies were tested for binding to H5 variants predicted to affect the stalk epitope by the crystal structure, and their binding patterns were compared with that of the prototypical stalk antibody (mAb F10; Sui et al., 2009; Fig. 4 B). Each H5 variant has a single residue mutation in the stalk region and was transiently expressed on 293T cells. FACS analysis showed that the five antibodies bound to all 13 H5 variants tested at levels quite similar to F10, for which a crystal structure had been generated to define this epitope. Thus, half of the neutralizing and a surprising 10% of all antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection bound to a conserved, critical epitope on the HA stalk. By comparison, none of 50 H1N1 strain-specific antibodies that we had previously isolated after annual vaccination before the 2009 pandemic had this reactivity (unpublished data). The frequency of pandemic-induced, stem-reactive antibodies (5/46) versus those from annual vaccine (0/50) is significantly greater (Chi-square test, P = 0.02). Further, this specificity is only rarely seen in human memory B cells (Corti et al., 2010) or from phage-display libraries (Sui et al., 2009). These observations support the idea that a vaccine might be developed that preferentially targets the HA stalk, thus providing broad protection against many influenza strains.",

Indeed, using spontaneous escape mutant selection, we found that the EM4C04 mAb binds to the Sa region of the HA globular head (unpublished data).

It is notable that three of five of the HA globular-head\u2013binding antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection were also broadly reactive to various H1N1 strains (Fig. 3 B). One such novel antibody was the SF1009-3B06 antibody that reacts strongly with the pandemic H1N1 strain, as well as all recent H1N1 vaccine strains (Fig. 3 B and Fig. S2 A). The precise epitope to which the 1009-3B06 antibody binds appears to be quite unique; it is only accessible on whole virions, not on recombinant HA, suggesting that the epitope is quaternary in nature. Finally, two antibodies cross-reacted and inhibited hemagglutination to all recent H1 vaccine strains and reacted strongly to the 1918 pandemic strain (antibodies 1009-3E04 and 1000-3E01; Fig. 3 B and Fig. 4 A, epitope-3). These mAbs bind to past vaccine strains with higher avidity than to the pandemic H1N1. Further studies are underway to precisely identify the epitopes of all neutralizing antibodies in this study.",

We selected three representative antibodies of the set we have identified for detailed functional analysis both in vitro (Fig. 3 C) and in vivo (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), including: EM-4C04, 1009-3B06, and 70-1F02. The antibodies EM-4C04 and 1009-3B06 are specific for the active site of the HA molecule, whereas 70-1F02 binds to the stalk region. Furthermore, EM-4C04 is highly specific for pandemic H1N1, whereas 1009-3B06 and 70-F02 display broadly cross-reactive binding (Fig. 3 B) and have functional activity against multiple recent and older H1N1 strains (Fig. 3 C). These antibodies were all highly effective at providing prophylactic protection against infection with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted pandemic H1N1 in 6\u20138-wk-old BALB/c mice (Fig. 5). Moreover, all three antibodies were effective therapeutically, even when they were administered as late as 60 h after the lethal challenge infection, well after the mice were symptomatic. For EM-4C04, we have successfully treated mice as far out as 72 h post-infection (unpublished data). Infected mice were already showing measurable weight loss that was reversed by administration of the antibody, demonstrating therapeutic potential even after the onset of disease. Viral clearance was analyzed in mice treated at 48 h after infection with EM4C04 (Fig. S4). As early as day 4, the antibody-treated mice exhibited more than a log reduction in viral titers; titers continued to decline, such that by day 6, virus was undetectable or present at very low levels. The untreated mice perished by day 7 or 8, whereas the treated mice cleared the infection with no detectable virus on day 12. Finally, 1009-3B06 and 70-1F02, which showed activity against several current and older H1N1 seasonal influenza strains in vitro (Fig. 3 C), were also tested in vivo against antigenically distinct influenza strains. For these experiments, mice were treated with 200 \u00b5g of mAb intraperitoneally 12 h before infection with a lethal dose of either pandemic H1N1 influenza or either of the two common influenza laboratory strains PR/8/34 or FM/1/47. 1009-3B06 and 70-1F02 showed protection against these antigenically distinct H1N1 influenza strains, as illustrated in Fig. 5. EM-4C04, which is highly specific for the pandemic H1N1, had no protective effect on infection with PR/8/34 or FM/1/47. In conclusion, the antibodies characterized herein show promise for development as broadly reactive therapeutic agents against the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, as well as against the majority of H1N1 and H5N1 influenza strains.",

The unique genetic composition of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus meant that our relatively young cohort probably had little or no preexisting specific antibody-mediated immunity to this virus before infection (Brockwell-Staats et al., 2009; Dawood et al., 2009; Garten et al., 2009; Hancock et al., 2009). Thus, two sources of B cells could have contributed to this response: newly recruited naive B cells and preexisting memory B cells that bound to epitopes conserved between past seasonal strains and the pandemic H1N1 strain. We theorize that predominant activation of the latter, preexisting memory cells can account for the observed high frequency of neutralizing antibodies (11/15 HA-binding antibodies), the majority (9/11) of which are cross-reactive with seasonal H1N1 strains (Fig. 3 C) and other group 1 influenza strains, including H5 HA. Several observations support this conjecture.",

            "text": "Most convincingly, there was a particularly high frequency of cross-reactive antibodies overall, with a high level of somatic mutations found particularly among the variable genes of cross-reacting cells (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). In fact, by ELISA most antibodies were cross-reactive and one third of the antibodies bound to past annual viral antigens at lower concentrations, suggesting higher avidity to past influenza strains than to the current pandemic H1N1 virus. Further, cross-reacting cells that bind with higher affinity to the pandemic H1N1 strain also have the highest frequency of variable-gene mutations (Fig. S3 B). Antibodies that were broadly cross-reactive were among the more highly mutated clones (Fig. S3 B). We propose that many of these cells were specific for cross-reactive epitopes present in annual influenza strains that then underwent further affinity maturation and adaptation to the infecting pandemic H1N1 virus. Supporting this conjecture, Corti et al. (2010) first demonstrated that naturally occurring HA stalk\u2013reactive memory B cells could be isolated from the blood of people recently immunized with the annual vaccine, before the outbreak of pandemic H1N1. The nature of that study was to screen EBV-transformed memory cell lines, thus precluding the determination of precise frequencies of these stalk-reactive B cells. However, these antibodies were estimated to be quite rare; occurring at one in thousands to one in hundreds of influenza-binding B cells, varying by individual. In contrast, we show that plasmablasts activated by infection with the highly novel pandemic H1N1 influenza strain have substantially increased targeting to the HA stalk region epitopes, totaling 10% of all influenza-specific antibodies and half of the neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4). In fact, most specific antibodies isolated in this study were cross-reactive to past influenza strains. Collectively, the data described supports a model in which divergent viruses that are conserved only at the most critical regions for function will elicit a higher proportion of cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies. Thus, although the activated plasmablasts of relatively few patients could be analyzed in detail at the monoclonal antibody level, we proffer that with the proper immunogen, the long-sought development of a pan-influenza vaccine might be possible.",

Collectively, the unique specificity against pandemic H1N1, the low levels of somatic mutation, and the unusually severe disease in the absence of predisposing conditions suggest that this patient may have mounted a primary immune response to the pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. The complete lack of preexisting immunity may have contributed to the more severe disease observed in this patient.

For example, patient EM, despite having the worst disease course, had the greatest HAI and MN serum titers. This may be caused by the time from infection (day 31), allowing full seroconversion, or by the presence of highly potent antibodies, such as EM-4C04, whose activities were less likely to titer out. The highly specific nature of the response from this patient may have contributed to this advantage, ultimately better targeting the epitopes of the pandemic H1N1 strain. In contrast, patient 1009 had relatively low HAI and MN serum titers but the highest frequency of broadly neutralizing antibodies and a less severe disease course. One possibility is that our sampling from this patient was done before peak serological responses. Another possibility is that the high frequency of these potent antibodies in the memory B cell compartment may have resulted in rapid resolution of infection, precluding the development of a high serological response. A third possibility is that despite broader protection, the stalk-reactive antibodies are on the whole less potent and more rapidly titrated out than the highly specific antibodies to the HA globular head. These various possibilities will be of significant interest to study in the future.",

Prophylactic therapy with polyclonal or mAbs has successfully been used for RSV, rabies, Hepatitis A and B, and varicella. In the case of influenza, mAbs have been shown to provide prophylactic or therapeutic protection in mice and other animal models (Reuman et al., 1983; Sweet et al., 1987; Palladino et al., 1995; Renegar et al., 2004). Passive transfer of maternal antibodies in humans has also been shown to confer protection (Puck et al., 1980). Several of the antibodies we isolated have broad neutralization capacity in vitro against divergent influenza strains and show potent prophylactic and therapeutic activity when used to treat mice that were lethally infected with influenza. These antibodies could provide much needed pandemic therapeutics to treat severe cases of influenza and to protect high-risk populations.",
