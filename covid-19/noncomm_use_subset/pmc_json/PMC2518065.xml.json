Mainstream statistics, time series, meta-analysis, randomized control trials and spatial techniques have been used to detect disease characteristics in a given dataset,15\u201318 but the substantive relationships between the disease characteristics across space-time often remain unknown. Similarly, the procedure generating epidemiologic curves19 (i.e. curves showing the day-to-day rate of SARS growth) does not account for important associations between epidemic characteristics and dominant space-time disease patterns and dependencies. Despite the aforementioned limitations of the mainstream approaches, it is highly desirable to develop methods that can incorporate the scattered and incomplete datasets generated by various surveillance systems20\u201322 and by different programmatic and sectoral actions23 in order to evaluate salient associations between epidemic determinants and quantify consequential space-time variations and patterns.",

Every network joint connected two B districts (BB), two W districts (WW), or a B and a W district (BW). The observed number of BW joints was compared with the expected number, and a standard normal deviation (z-score) was used to test the significance. High negative values of the statistics indicated clustering of infected cases on the network, whereas high positive values provided evidence of spacing. Seven networks were considered as follows:\nN1. Local transmission: Two districts were considered connected if they shared a common geographical boundary.N2. Nearest district: Each district was connected to its nearest neighbour as measured by the distance between the centroids of the districts.N3. Population size: Districts were ranked according to population size, and consecutive districts in the corresponding hierarchy were appropriately connected.N4. Population density: The same as in N3, but ranked by population density, instead.N5. Number of doctors: The same as in N3, but ranked by number of doctors in the district.N6. Number of hospitals: The same as for N3, but ranked by number of hospitals in the district.N7.

The IM-curve was then filtered using a discrete wavelet transform implemented by MatLab (with Daubechies db3 as mother wave and four decomposition levels). In this way, the curve was decomposed into a low-frequency component (a4) and high-frequency components (d1, d2, d3, d4) (Fig. 2). Daily data on new SARS cases were grouped according to the district of residence. The time-variation of a4 indicated that SARS cases in Beijing became increasingly clustered towards the end of April, 2003, followed by a decrease in clustering during 1\u20138 May 2003. After 9 May 2003, the time-variation of a4 and d4 indicated that spatial clustering was sharply declining.",

Changes in the spatial spread of SARS over time indicated which intervention measures are likely to be most effective at different phases of the outbreak. When the epidemic is growing via diffused infection, efficient intervention measures include isolating cases and reducing inter-regional movement. When cases of the disease appear in clusters, resources should be directed towards curbing transmission within localities that have a high incidence of infection. Our results suggested that improving control measures at the local level would have been the most efficient approach, before the end of April, 2003. Local intervention strategies include quarantine of family members. Once these measures take effect, transmission is reduced substantially and becomes dominated by more remote contacts. The evidence that diffusion of infections drove the declining stage of the outbreak may indicate that the measures were successfully controlling local transmission.",

Advanced mathematical modelling of an epidemic could potentially unveil the relationships between various determinants, but this modelling is often impossible due to the unavailability of the necessary scientific knowledge, including a lack of understanding of the fundamental disease mechanisms.35,36 Nevertheless, the present study shows that using the available datasets an informative modelling approach can be developed that is based on the pair-wise linking of epidemic determinants and the formulation of a network that systematically connects the relevant statistics. In addition, unlike earlier SARS modelling studies,5 the present approach accounts in an efficient manner for the spatial variation of the data available. This approach is particularly useful when the disease mechanisms are not clear and the corresponding mathematical model is difficult to develop for reasons mentioned above. Moreover, the approach can be successfully implemented to simulate the response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors, identify target areas and determine the critical time and relevant factors. Given the response by individuals, institutions and governments to a new and dangerous disease, the findings of the present study can be useful in the implementation of efficient epidemic intervention strategies and effective population protection policies.",

The latter are available primarily in cases in which the fundamental disease mechanisms (molecular biology, etc.) are well understood. In this sense, SARS modelling could benefit from future developments in basic scientific research in disease etiology and mathematical theories of epidemic propagation, as well as from sophisticated surveillance capabilities and meta-analysis. Furthermore, the present SARS modelling could be improved by considering epidemic variation and dependence in a composite space-time continuum under conditions of multi-sourced uncertainty. This may involve a combination of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques.",

A wide variety of inter-disciplinary datasets that are relevant to the epidemic spread can be integrated by means of this framework. The statistics functions and spatial analysis techniques described above can be readily applied to the study of epidemics other than SARS. Furthermore, the methodological framework is not limited to the statistical tools and datasets considered in this paper, but is more general and flexible, in the sense that it may include additional information sources, statistics functions and models; and it can allow the performance of other types of logical inferences, thus generating new findings and conclusions concerning the epidemic under investigation. By generalizing the current approach within the context of random field theories with temporal GIS techniques, one may consider additional issues related to the next generation of (stochastic) SARS models allowing for space-time variations, multi-sourced uncertainty, seasonality and varying transmission modes, the case of SARS virus long-time persistence, and examining the case of global eradication rather than local control in terms of early epidemic detection measures.",
