Immunohistochemistry revealed multifocally deposited IgG antibodies in the glomerular tufts (Fig. 4). Electron microscopy and IHC findings were consistent with immune-complex associated glomerulonephritis and morphologically highly compatible with type I MPGN. In humans, type I MPGN is\nthe most common and classical type of MPGN, often associated with idiopathic or systemic immune complex disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or chronic infection [1, 11]. In an attempt to identify the antigen in the deposited immune complexes and given the history of administration of a\nS. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine and passively administered antibody against Salmonella, IHC was also performed with rabbit\nanti-Salmonella polyclonal antibodies obtained from the vaccine manufacturer, but was unsuccessful. This finding is not unexpected, however, because it is highly likely that\nthe binding site for the anti-Salmonella antibody was already bound due to immune complex formation.

Immune complex glomerulonephritis in cattle is uncommon [2, 3, 8, 12, 14, 15]. Deposition of circulating immune complexes in the glomeruli is usually caused by persistent antigenemia and production of antibodies by the host in\nresponse to the infection [2, 3], although in some cases no infectious cause is identified [8]. Persistent BVDV infection is reported [2, 12] as a cause of immune complex glomerulonephritis,\nbut was ruled out in the four calves that were tested in this report. Production of antibodies in response to vaccination, followed by experimental challenge to Mycoplasma\nmycoides subsp. mycoides has also been reported to cause glomerulonephritis [7]. Most previously reported cases of immune\ncomplex glomerulonephritis were at least 18 months old with the youngest case being 2 months old [12]. Moreover, previous reports of glomerulonephritis in\ncattle are usually described as single cases, whereas over 50% (7/13) of this group of calves showed clinical signs and were euthanized or died, suggesting a common denominator related to\nmanagement or environmental exposure.",

Additionally, inflammation and disseminated activation of coagulation in multifocal vasculitis can cause a hypercoagulable state. Subsequent disseminated\nintravascular coagulation may have been the culprit behind Case 1\u2019s thrombocytopenia and evidence of petechial and mucosal hemorrhage. Among previous reports of glomerulonephritis, M.\nmycoides subsp. mycoides was associated with pulmonary vasculitis [7], but neither lesions of multifocal fibrinoid vasculitis\nnor clinical complications of thrombosis were described [2, 3, 8, 12, 14, 15].

Typhimurium-based\ncore antigen vaccine, 2) administration of hyperimmune serum containing antibodies to S. Typhimurium subcutaneously within 24 hr of birth, and 3) active immunization of the\ncalves at 7 and 28 days of age with the same S. Typhimurium-based core antigen vaccine administered to their dams likely caused a very high concentration of antigen-antibody\ncomplexes, which were deposited in the glomeruli resulting in MPGN. Antigen-antibody complexes could also have resulted from a combination of colostral antibodies and immunization against IBR\nand PI-3; however this vaccine was administered only once making the theory of excess antibody-antigen less likely than for S. Typhimurium. Recent studies have described calves\u2019\nresponses to vaccination against respiratory pathogens as early as 2 to 4 weeks of age in the face of maternal antibodies and no adverse effects associated with vaccination were reported [4, 5, 13]. On the other hand, glomerulonephritis was reported following vaccination\nagainst M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, with the difference being that antibodies and antigens resulted from active immunization and challenge with M.\nmycoides subsp. mycoides, respectively [7]. Notably, in the cases reported herein, the same S.\nTyphimurium-based core antigen vaccine was used to vaccinate the dams and the calves and likely resulted in colostral antibodies highly specific for the same vaccine antigen administered to the\ncalves. The calves also received an injectable anti-sera which contained antibodies to S. Typhimurium. The peak occurrence of disease was shortly after the second dose of the\ncore antigen vaccine (Table 1). Persistent antigenemia from natural exposure to a pathogen can cause MPGN, but no common pathogen was identified in\nthe necropsied calves. The IHC for S. Typhimurium antigen in the glomerulus was negative, which, as explained above, is not unexpected. In hindsight, serology on some or all of\nthe calves to quantify antibodies to S. Typhimurium in circulation could have also been performed to at least demonstrate antibody acquisition from colostrum or the hyperimmune\nserum. However, even if detected it would not have definitively proven that the immune complexes were S. Typhimurium in origin.",

However, it is plausible that IV\nfluid therapy provided support of renal perfusion. It is unknown if any other treatment(s) could have improved the outcome. However, based on the hypothesis that the immune complexes were the\nresult of the interaction of passively acquired antibodies and active immunization, it is postulated that the high morbidity could have been avoided by delaying vaccine administration until at\nleast 21 days after administration of the hyperimmune serum. The label on the hyperimmune serum (Quatracon-2X; Boehringer Ingelhein Vetmedica) specifically cautions not to vaccinate with other\nviral and bacterial vaccines until 21 days after administration.",
