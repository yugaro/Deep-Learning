Research funds tend to be disproportionately skewed toward high-profile diseases, while suboptimal distribution of proven technologies and interventions for under-nutrition, vaccine-preventable diseases, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) (7) receive little attention, thereby perpetuating the mortality and morbidity burdens due to these conditions. Furthermore, current contributions toward multi-lateral organizations (e.g. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria) have not been optimized. In the case of TB, for example, antiquated diagnostic tools and therapeutic options dating back at least a half-century are still the mainstays used today, perpetuating the development of drug resistance. As such, the report emphasizes the significance of: appropriate application of innovation and technology toward identifying acceptable and accessible solutions; health systems research; novel proliferation incentives (e.g. advanced market commitments); and improved methods, greater connectivity, and wider access for disseminating knowledge to contexts where they are most urgently required, especially since good health outcomes result from applying global strategies through local forces (communities, families, and decentralized institutions).",

Also, as a matter of global responsibility, the US should invest in health worldwide as it has and continues to rely heavily on internationally trained health workers; in the year 2000, foreign-trained nurses and physicians accounted for 9.1 and 25% (a combined workforce totaling over 350,000 professionals) of US health personnel, respectively (8, 9). Acknowledging the need for skilled, experienced, and knowledgeable health professionals to remain vested in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), the recommendations outline incentives (monetary, career-enhancing opportunities), and leveraging scientific and academic collaborations toward skills transfer, policy development, and improving institutional capacity. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) recent Global Health Initiative (10, 11) provides a good example of advancing research and human resource development in LMICs through financing institutional partnerships for chronic diseases research. This scheme and the Fogarty International Scholars Program incorporate opportunities for US investigators and trainees to work in new and varied environments, and forges alliances with US universities. In the long term, imparting models that engender high-quality scientific investigation and self-sufficiency will augment coordinated research and health programs between countries, inform national policies, and also create opportunities for young analysts, researchers, and junior faculty to be able to remain in-country and complete the circle by teaching others. Local capability will breed sustainability and foster global collaboration.",

Augmented investments in global health must be comprehensive, continuing to support initiatives aimed at highly prevalent infectious threats, but also providing funds for neglected diseases of poverty and health systems development. Novel transaction mechanisms and training methods can aid local dissemination of financing, procurement and distribution of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, and capacity development; ultimately, it is the local institutions (families, communities, and service organizations) that can best adapt global solutions to local contexts in order to deliver sustainable results. At the same time, concerted global cooperation among leaders of nations is required to address broader issues like global warming and its effects on health.",

In addition, the report advocates coordination amongst the huge variety of agencies involved in global health. Although the recommendation is justified and current efforts are fragmented, sometimes duplicated, and often unplanned and improvized, it must be acknowledged that coordinating this plethora of vested groups introduces immense complexity and traditional models of organizing and synchronizing efforts may not work. The recently formed Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases, a consortium of six of the world's most influential health agencies, is a promising new venture committed to coordinating the global health community's fight against NCDs, and will attempt to do so by engaging more collaborative priority-setting (13).",

Arguably, out of necessity, there is a high tolerance for risk in the types of innovative research undertaken in resource constrained settings of LMICs. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored a study in rural India from which a cervical cancer screening test emerged as effective and acceptable, prompting the likelihood that this test will replace long-established pap smears (16, 17). Furthermore, the manufacturers of the test have declared that market demand and Gates Foundation subsidies will lower the cost to approximately US$5 per test, making it a viable option for rich and poor countries alike.",

For instance, although the promise of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease events has been around for some years (18, 19), there has been little progress in this direction in developed countries. However, recognizing the looming health and economic threat of NCDs, researchers in India collaborated with investigators in Canada to investigate the viability of this simple, low-cost idea. The Indian Polycap phase II study (20) is thus an example of a trial with potentially significant global impacts that overcame scientific and political barriers. The success of the polypill is likely to have impacts on lowering costs, enhancing adherence, expanding accessibility, and improving multiple risk factor control in both LMICs and more developed countries (21). Another noteworthy alliance between GlaxoSmithKline and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, a large India-based manufacturer, to promote the development and marketing of generic drugs to LMICs, highlights the growing need for low-cost drugs for the majority of the world's population (22).",

In making sensible decisions regarding resource allocation, independent evidence-based recommendations to government to regulate the use of health technologies, as is the function of the National Institutes of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK, provides an alternative model. All told, no single strategy would be infallible, but learning from a variety of contexts and applying a combination of strategies may help reduce expenditures and create a more sustainable US health system.",

The combined economies of these four countries are expected to be larger than the G6 within 40 years (28). Additionally, the ever-increasing speed and access to information technology will yield increasingly aware populations, cognizant of current affairs worldwide. In this changing world, the US will need to adapt to maintain its historical international competitiveness. The cited examples (16, 20, 25, 26) of research, cheaper manufacturing, care delivery, and regulation offer glimpses of innovation born out of need, in different settings where resource inputs and market size plus composition vary. As such, global health offers areas of great need for investment in innovation and education.",
