Sequence analysis revealed identical hexons, which were identified as HAdV type 7 by BLASTn analysis. The genome from DG01_2011 was then sequenced, assembled, annotated, and analyzed. Figure 1 presents the genomic organization and transcription map of DG01_2011. This genome contains 35,240 bp with a GC content of 51.08%. A total of 39 coding sequences were identified. These genome data, noted formally as \u201chuman adenovirus 7 strain CHN/DG01/2011/7[P7H7F7]\u201d and in this report as \u201cDG01_2011\u201d, were deposited in GenBank (accession number KC440171).",

Although seemingly antiquated in comparison to genome sequencing, REA profiles are still useful for comparisons with unsequenced but previously reported genome types and strains, and also as rapid and less-expensive alternatives for large-scale characterizations of viruses given a correct reference strain. Using the genome type denomination of Li, et al.20, DG01_2011 is identified as HAdV-7d, evidenced by the REA patterns and identical with the first reported HAdV-7d25, as shown in Figure 2. The REA patterns generated from DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, which caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak comprising 70 cases amongst young children in the Shaanxi Province in 2009, including one fatality24, and CQ1198_2010, which was associated with an epidemic in Chongqing, Southwestern China (Ni, K., et al., unpublished; JX625134), are identical to each other and also identical with those of HAdV-7d reported earlier in Israel (1998) and Japan (1999)2627. The REA patterns of CQ1198_2010 in this study provide evidence to amend the less-descriptive designation of \u201cmutant HAdV-7d2\u201d noted by Ni, K., et al. in the GenBank entry for CQ1198_2010 (JX625134). For reference, the in silico REA profile for the prototype Gomen HAdV-7 is provided; the REA patterns for these recent isolates differ clearly from the prototype, as shown in Figure 2. HAdV-7 prototype is the correct reference genome as three REA profiles, BclI, SalI, and XhoI, showed identical patterns and complement the REA patterns that differ, along with sequence similarities across the genome.",

These hexons form a subclade that is on the same branch with another subclade containing several non-China isolates, including HAdV-7d2 from the U.S., as shown in Figure 3A. The bootstrap value of 65 indicates the hexons from the China genomes are highly similar to each, but are separate from the U.S. HAdV-7d2 subclade (bootstrap value 82). Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of 16 available HAdV-7 whole genomes revealed DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, and CQ1198_2010 forming a subclade comprising HAdV-7d, and confirming the close relationships with each other, reaffirming a common lineage (Figure 3B) that is distinct from the HAdV-7d2 strains of the U.S.A. (bootstrap value 100). All of the genome types form subclades that are separate from the clade containing the prototype 7 (Gomen; 1952), with HAdV-7h forming a separate subclade in the genome phylogenetic analysis in contrast to the hexon gene phylogenetic analysis.",

Comparative genomics analysis documented seven single nucleotide substitution and one single base insertion differences between the DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes. Of these, two single nucleotide substitutions were localized in the ITRs and one non-synonymous substitution each was located in the DNA polymerase, penton base, and 34 kDa protein coding sequences (Table 1). One synonymous nucleotide substitution each was present in the 100-kDa hexon assembly-associated protein and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II. The single nucleotide insertion was in a non-coding region of DG01_2011. There were three single nucleotide substitutions in coding sequences and seven base deletion differences in the ITRs between CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes. One synonymous substitution (C to T) was located in hexon assembly-associated protein (A254A) and the other two non-synonymous substitutions G to C and G to T were located in DNA polymerase (S55C) and 34 kDa protein (P87Q), respectively. The nucleotide deletions in ITRs of CQ1198_2010 may be sequencing errors given that the left ITR was not identical with the right ITR, or may represent recent mutations. If exclusive of ITR differences, there were only three single nucleotide substitutions between the CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 genomes (99.99%). For strain DG01_2011, it had a higher genome identity with CQ1198_2010 (99.98%) than 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (99.97%) if exclusive of ITR difference.

All three genes have Ka/Ks ratios of less than 1 (Table 2). This is in accordance with the hypothesis that organismal evolution is dominated by negative selection, i.e., ones removing mutations harmful to fitness28. Specifically, both hexon and penton base genes have less non-synonymous substitutions per site, which leads to the low ratios of Ka/Ks. Although the non-synonymous substitutions and Ka/Ks ratio of the fiber gene is also low, it is relatively higher than for the hexon and penton base genes. This may indicate that the fiber gene has less negative selection pressures, likely due to tissue tropism being determined and constrained by the fiber gene. Overall, the majority of mutations are synonymous and do not affect the integrity of the hexon, penton base, and fiber proteins.",

Genome type HAdV-7d apparently originated and circulated in China from 1958\u20131990, becoming the predominant strain during the period of 1980\u2013199020. It was also the prevalent genome type found in Korea during two outbreaks in 1995\u20131996 and 2001\u20132002, accounting for 98\u2013100% all of the type 7 HAdV strains assayed30. Interestingly, despite reports of global circulation, HAdV-7, and in particular HAdV-7d, epidemics had not been reported in mainland China from 1990 to 2009. In 2009, HAdV-7 was identified as the respiratory pathogen in an outbreak that included a fatality in Shaanxi24 and also in a 2010 outbreak in Chongqing (unpublished), signaling a reemergence. Thorough characterization of these pathogens is evidenced by the availability of two genome sequences (JF800905 and JX625134), both of which are further identified as the HAdV-7d genome type in this report, and shown to be nearly identical to this report of an isolate from a 2011 ARD outbreak in Guangdong Province (strain DG01_2011) by comparative genomics and, in particular, in silico REA pattern analysis, as presented in Figure 2.",

For HAdV comparisons, the caveat is to use the correct reference genome; for example, HAdV-55 contains a partial hexon gene from HAdV-11, comprising approximately only 2.6% of the length of the genome, in a chassis of HAdV-14, comprising approximately 97.4% of the length of the genome37. Using the genome of HAdV-11 as a reference yields meaningless patterns that are subject to researcher-biased interpretations and leads to erroneous conclusions that HAdV-55 is a genome type of HAdV-11. Using the HAdV-14 genome as a reference provides a closer approximation of the genome identities438. However, the recombination event revealed by whole genome sequencing, with the conflicting \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d renal pathogen epitope observed with ARD symptoms, indicates this was a novel and emergent pathogen43739404142. In contrast, for HAdV-7d, the prototype HAdV-7 genome provides the correct reference: three REA patterns are identical (BclI, SalI, and XhoI); four are obviously different (BamHI, BglI, HpaI, and SmaI); and four are highly similar with a few differences in the band patterns (BglII, BstEII, HindIII, EcoRI, and XbaI), shown in Figure 2.",

Strain DG01_2011 has a higher genome identity with CQ1198_2010 than 0901HZ/ShX/2009, which also supports the hypothesis that strain CQ1198_2010 is be the ancestor of strain DG01_2011.",

This serendipitous insight into the molecular evolution of these respiratory pathogens from HAdV species B demonstrates the genomes of individual HAdV types, such as type 7, contain changes revealed only by high-resolution genome sequences and may be important in the context of HAdV molecular evolution, viral fitness, origins and bases of clinical and pathogenicity differences, and account for emergent and re-emergent pathogens. BLAST analysis reveals the recombinant region to encode the entire L1 52/55 kDa gene of HAdV-B16 with flanking non-coding sequences. The BLAST scores indicate the first highly similar sequence, aside from several type 7 sequences, is that from the HAdV-B16 prototype (Max. score 2710, Total score 2710, Query cover 100%, E-value 0.0, Ident. 96%) and a HAdV-B16 recombinant (2687, 2687, 100%, 0.0. 96%), with additional homologous and highly similar sequences found in HAdV-B50 (2436, 2436, 100%, 0.0, 93%) and HAdV-B21 strains (2422, 2422, 100%, 0.0, 93%). This encodes a DNA-binding protein that is expressed in both the early and late stages of infection, suggesting it could play multiple roles in the adenoviral life cycle. The L1 52/55 kDa protein interacts with the IVa2 protein and is an essential protein that is absolutely required for DNA packaging as well5354. Effects of this particular moderate-sized recombination from HAdV-B16 into the HAdV-B7 genome chassis and the resultant emergent pathogen are unknown pending wet-bench investigations and additional clinical reports. The HAdV-7 prototype strain (AY594255)55 analyzed is also known as the Gomen strain, which was isolated as a clinical specimen from a throat washing of a U.S. military recruit with pharyngitis56. This strain is nearly contemporaneous with the Greider strain (AY594256)57, aka HAdV-7a, which was used to develop the vaccine strain1458. Although there are minor genome differences, e.g., point mutations, between the prototype and the vaccine strains, pairwise genome dot blot analysis (PipMaker) indicated no recombination events14.",

The sequence data, collected with an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer, provided an average genome coverage of 3- to 5-fold, with both strands represented. Gaps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using different primers and resequenced. These sequencing ladders were assembled with the SeqMan Pro software 7.0.1 (DNASTAR, Inc.; Madison, WI. USA). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL and BLAST software.
