Even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses. Climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available. Again, the effect may be disproportionate, particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe. Increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes.5,6\nAedes aegypti, a major vector of dengue, is limited to distribution by the 10 \u00b0C winter isotherm, but this is shifting, so threatening an expansion of disease ever northward.7",

Outbreaks of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall, leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers. Of all species of mammals, rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions. Small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size, inhabiting desert and semidesert areas, particularly in food quantity and quality. A prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the Four Corners region of the United States led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators, such as coyotes, snakes and birds of prey. But at the end of the drought, heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pi\u00f1on nuts and grasshopper populations, which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers, among them deer mice carrying hantaviruses.",

This had the unfortunate consequence of reducing the local peridomestic cat population that had hitherto kept feral rodent numbers in check. The consequence of these sharp climatic changes was the emergence of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by the arenavirus Machupo. This pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers and act as an indicator that disease emergence may occur in the period following such changes. A similar pattern of events occurred in 1994 when in Venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus.8",

It is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours. This is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence. Frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases. This is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, when the infection was disseminated from China to at least 17 countries in less than a week. Based on the events of 2003, Hufnagel11 have designed a mathematical model that simulates accurately the spread of SARS virus to countries that experienced four or more cases. The utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk. Moreover, the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone, were one available. Once the statistical information is available, such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future SARS epidemic. Were a vaccine available, the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused. This assumes an index case made a single air journey. However, this increases substantially to 75% in the event of an index case making two journeys, with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips. Analysis of air traffic from Mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high, but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted.12",

Starting in September 1998, clusters of human cases of encephalitis began to be reported from the Malaysian states of Perak and Negri Sembilan. By far the most extensive outbreak was in the village of Sungai Nipah near the city of Bukit Polandok. Almost all of the cases had a direct link to the local piggeries, and coincided with accounts of illness amongst pigs 1 to 2 weeks beforehand. A total of 265 cases were notified, with mortality approaching 40%. In March 1999, infection developed in 11 Singaporean abattoir workers handing pig carcasses, one of which proved fatal. Initially these outbreaks were believed due to Japanese encephalitis (JE), but a number of cases had been vaccinated previously against JE virus and there was no evidence of JE virus antibodies among the remainder. The link with Hendra virus soon followed after the isolation of virus from an infected pig farmer. The new agent, now named Nipah virus after the locality it was first reported, shares 80% sequence homology with Hendra virus, with both viruses now being regarded as members of the henipaviruses within the Paramyxoviridae family.

The discovery of a canine flavivirus distantly related human hepatitis C virus (HCV) raises some intriguing questions as to the origin of HCV in human populations.34 Although evidence was found of virus in the canine liver, there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis C-like virus causing liver disease in dogs.

This virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus.43 This phenomenon may be widespread in animal\u2013pathogen interactions.

Clade B viruses are pathogenic for humans and share with members of clade A an ability to recognize transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) on cell surfaces. Although both clade A and clade B viruses recognize murine TfR1, only clade B viruses have evolved the capacity to also bind human TfR1. A single amino-acid change in the viral G1 envelope glycoprotein appears sufficient for this expansion of host range to humans. Intriguingly, arenaviruses may have merged as human pathogens by more than one independent pathway of adaptation: clade C New World arenaviruses share with Old World arenaviruses an affinity for \u03b1-dystroglycan, a highly conserved cell surface protein involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

A single amino acid change in the gag-encoded matrix protein (M30R) is present in these cross-species transmissions.

This process is increasingly recognized as occurring among other RNA viruses containing structurally distinct genome segments, for example the bunyaviruses. In 1997, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever was detected in northeastern Kenya and Western Somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall. Around 370 human deaths were recorded, mainly in the Garissa region of Kenya. Surprisingly, however, there was evidence of Rift Valley fever virus (RFV) infection in only 23% of cases. The cloning of PCR products revealed the existence of a new, recombinant bunyavirus, one that contained the L and S RNA segments of Bunyawera virus and an ill-defined M segment distantly related to Ngari virus, a bunyavirus previously reported from Senegal in 1979.50 Ngari virus is widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa and as far south as Madagascar. The result in the Garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans. This new recombinant virus occurred independently of RFV infection during the outbreak, the number of infections also the result of environmental factors that equally resulted in an elevation of RFV activity.",

Following initial infection of a host cell, many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication. HIV and SIV are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1) is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of HIV-1 in Old World monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection, and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection. Recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of SIV from sooty mangabeys have revealed that TRIM5\u03b1 exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques, due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection.53 However, rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 does not restrict SIV isolated from macaques, and human TRIM5\u03b1 does not restrict HIV-1 infection,54 although the introduction of single amino-acid mutation in the SPRY domain of TRIM5\u03b1 can restore its ability to recognize and restrict HIV.55 Different primate orthologues of TRIM5\u03b1 have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids, and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs.56 Similarly, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release. The retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein U counteract APOBEC3G and tetherin, respectively.57,58 Recently, a study of four African Green Monkey subspecies, which can be infected with divergent strains of SIV, highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian APOBEC3G in the absence of ongoing disease. In response to these changes, both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor.59 These studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host, and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses. Recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of SIV and HIV-1 in different host species. HIV-1 and SIV infection of humans and rhesus macaques, respectively, are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.60 In contrast, in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited (Figure 2), a finding consistent with a suppressed chronic immune activation in non-pathogenic infection that is not observed in pathogenic infections.",

Viruses must cross epithelial and endothelial barriers in order to invade organs, such as lung, gut and brain, which are protected by sheets of polarized cells that restrict the passage of substances across these layers: these do not express viral receptors on their apical surfaces. Human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23/5 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells, although the mechanism of infection at the apical surface has been unclear since both viral receptors are not expressed at the apical side of the cells yet both are required for viral infection. CAR and \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23/5 integrin are not normally available for viral binding, being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia, respectively. However, macrophages respond to viral infection by secretion of Il-8 (CXCL8) that in turn triggers the delocalization of \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23/5 from the basolateral membrane to the apical cell surface, thus transforming the cell into a potential host for replication.61 Thus it is conceivable that viruses crossing from one species to another may utilize secondary receptor elements shared between closely related species as a means of initiating infection in a new host.",

However, the reasons why Ebola Reston is not pathogenic for humans remain unclear. Ebola virus VP24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 in the nucleus. There are some differences between how interferon signaling is suppressed between Marburg virus and Ebola virus: Marburg virus blocks both STAT-1 and STAT-2 activation through the effects of VP40 rather than VP35 as is the case with Ebola virus.66 Recent studies have revealed that Lassa virus can also suppress interferon signaling through the C terminal domain of its nucleoprotein which both resembles and functions similar to an endonuclease. It can hydrolyze dsRNA, but not ssRNA or DNA.67 This is the first time a virus has been shown to have dsRNA specific exonuclease activity, and in addition, the first time a virus has been shown to counteract IFN responses by blocking interferon regulatory factor 3 translocation to the nucleus, by actually digesting the pathogen-associated molecular pattern.",

These workers went on to claim the presence of XMRV in around 100 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, with subsequent estimates of 3.3% prevalence among blood donors. However, these results were not reproducible70 and a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses undergoing transmission from person to person strongly suggested the presence of a contaminant.71 This link with XMRV has been retracted but serves to illustrate the inherent difficulties in associating disease with a specific etiological agent.

The importance of early recognition and the availability of local expertise has been confirmed recently as this year in Uganda, where the discovery of the Bundibugyo strain of Ebola virus in 2000 led to the strengthening of capacity at the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe by the US Centers for Disease Control.

Recent cases of Ebola virus in July and August 2012 have been rapidly diagnosed as a result of this regional investment in infrastructure, thus preventing its spread to Kampala, the Ugandan capital.
