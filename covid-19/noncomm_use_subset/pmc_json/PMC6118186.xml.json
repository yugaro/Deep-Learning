As pilgrims performing Hajj come from both, the northern and southern hemispheres, some come from areas with active transmission of seasonal influenza. The seasonal availability of the influenza vaccine presents a challenge for the preventive efforts related to Hajj.2",

This requirement was implemented for domestic Hajjis in 1437 (2016). Health centers and selected hospitals all over the kingdom provided the southern hemisphere in 2016 vaccine free of charge. The vaccine uptake was modest (29%) in 2016. In 2017, adequate quantities of the southern hemisphere vaccine were purchased and made available in ample time before the Hajj. Media and official channels published strong calls to increase vaccination compliance. More than 262,000 doses of the vaccine were provided to domestic Hajjis (coverage, 44%). In 2016, similar quantities of the vaccine had been requested, but only a fraction was available for use at the right time due to procurement challenges.",

Limiting factors include vaccine availability, cost, and the logistics of administering the vaccine at the right time. However, all countries with Muslim communities should be strongly encouraged to provide the influenza vaccine to their Hajjis. The benefit of influenza vaccination in preparation for Hajj extends beyond the protection of Hajjis themselves during their rituals. Close contact with individuals coming from different climatic zones exposes Hajjis to different strains of influenza viruses and may trigger outbreaks when Hajjis go back to their home countries.",
