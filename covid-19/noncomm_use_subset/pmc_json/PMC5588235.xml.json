This was the case in our previous study [1] where 72% of the cases of RTI remained uncharacterized. Since 2001, several new human viruses have been identified in respiratory samples [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. These viruses were originally isolated from individuals with respiratory tract disease, most of whom were children. Accumulating data indicate that these viruses can cause both upper RTI (URTI) and lower RTI (LRTI) in children [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [2,3], human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 [4,5], human bocavirus (Boca) [6,7], human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV) [8,9,10] may be responsible for many respiratory tract illnesses, the cause of which has remained a mystery for decades.",

The clinical impact of these newly discovered viruses remains unknown. The reported data clearly show that hMPV has been circulating for at least 50 years and has a definite clinical impact [2]. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that Boca is pathogenic [14], but data from previous studies suggest that WUV and KIV on their own are not pathogenic [15]. The newly discovered HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were previously considered to be pathogenic [4,5]. We aimed here to study the prevalence of the newly discovered viruses hMPV, HCoV-NL63, Boca, KIV and WUV in RTI in Kuwait.",

Moreover, 30 (10.5%) of the hospitalized patients infected with the newly discovered viruses suffered from LRTI, and 13 (4.6%) suffered from URTI. Bronchiolitis was the most common clinical symptom (106 patients or 37.2%), followed by pneumonia (64 patients or 22.5%) (table 3). This result is similar to that described in a study in Saudi Arabia [19]. Most of the patients with respiratory virus infections in this study were infants <2 years of age, pointing to this being the age group that is the most affected, similar to previous studies [1,19,20].",

Previous studies showed that hMPV infections appear to have a seasonal distribution. In the Philippines, peak positivity for hMPV infections occurred in March [22]. In Hong Kong, hMPV outbreaks were apparent during the spring/summer season [24]. In contrast, in Norway, hMPV outbreaks occurred during the winter season [25]. Other reports have suggested that hMPV may be circulating throughout the year [26]. Data from our study showed that hMPV infections appeared to have a seasonal distribution in Kuwait. The peak months were January and February, which indicated that hMPV was prevalent in the winter. A seasonal distribution of Boca was noted from December to June, especially during the winter/spring season, which is consistent with other studies [6,27]. However, in China, the peak seasons were noted as being from June to November, especially during the summer season [28]. In Canada, Boca activity did not seem to be associated with a specific time of the year [29]. A seasonal distribution of WUV was noted in summer, autumn and winter. KIV activity was detected only during the autumn/winter months from October to January. In contrast, in Japan, the peak seasonal activity of WUV and KIV was detected during the spring/early summer months [30]. This variety of reported seasonal distributions of WUV, KIV, hMPV and Boca infections suggests the presence of other factors that may affect the activity of these viruses throughout the year in different countries, such as temperature, humidity and precipitation.",
