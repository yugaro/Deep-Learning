A\nscenario tree model for risk assessment is generally composed of three types of nodes, namely category nodes, infectious nodes, and detection nodes, so as to theoretically calculate the probabilities of infected animals being\ndetected at a given level of prevalence. To generalize the output of this model, the number of initial cattle was set as tens of thousands instead of the actual number of cattle in Nemuro. The numbers of either persistent or\ntransient infection with BVDV in each animal category were calculated as a product of all conditional probabilities describing the nodes of each specific categorization and infection pathway. The overall probabilities of detecting\nand missing cattle persistently or transiently infected with BVDV (BVD cattle) through the monitoring nodes as interventions for BVD control in a default or scenario settings were calculated as a product of the probabilities of\ninfection and all conditional probabilities describing the nodes of each specific detection pathway. The total numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle were calculated as an output of the default or scenarios and were compared to\nevaluate the efficacy of the interventions in the scenarios. The scenario tree was developed in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2013), using the software @Risk 6 (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.), and was run\nusing 10,000 iterations.",

PI cattle of 0\u20132 M were assumed to be detected\nby apparent clinical manifestations of insufficient growth. In the present model, the probability that 0\u20132 M PI cattle being detected by clinical manifestations, Pmp (0\u20132), was set to approximately 80%. In parallel, a\nBVD cow that delivered its calf diagnosed as PI should be detected. The probability that >19 M PI cattle would be detected by clinical manifestations, Pmp (>19), was set to approximately 80%, with a hypothesis\nthat 83% of the >19 M cattle deliver calves in a year. Although most of the PI calves were assumed to be identified during 0\u20132 M, some of the PI calves would be detected at a later phase, such as 3\u20138 or 9\u201314 M as insufficiently\ngrown cattle. The probabilities that 3\u20138 and 9\u201314 M PI cattle would be detected by clinical manifestations, Pmp (3\u20138) and Pmp (9\u201314), respectively, were set to approximately 40% and 20%, respectively. On the\nother hand, PI cattle of 15\u201318 M were assumed to be rarely detected by clinical manifestations since the older the PI cattle, the fewer signs they are expected to show, besides reproductive disorder. Transient infection of BVDV in\ncattle is mainly subclinical or clinical over a short period. In the present model, TI cattle from the >19 M group would only be detected by reproductive disorder with a probability of 30%, which was derived from the rates of\ncalving in delivered cattle, and delivery of the PI calf as an immature fetus would be caused by BVDV infection over 33% of the gestation period. We did not assume the presence of other reproductive disorders, including conception\nfailure and abortion, as these are also caused by other infectious diseases, non-infectious diseases, or environmental factors.",

In Nemuro, all of the cattle kept at the summer communal pasture are mandatorily investigated for BVDV infection by RT-PCR\nmethod using serum samples prior to communal pasture grazing [29]. In the present model, the cattle older than three months were assumed to possibly use the summer communal pastures with a\ncertain probability (Pc), which was changed from 10 to 50% in the scenario models. In Nemuro, independent of the use of summer communal pasture, all of the lactating cows are mandatorily screened for BVDV infection by\nRT-PCR method using bulk tank milk samples. As this screening test is usually performed over six month intervals during every spring and autumn, cows that were not lactating as dry cows at the time of the initial screening test\nwould be investigated during the latter screening test scheme; therefore, theoretically, all of the delivered cattle would be screened no less than once per year. In the present model, PI or TI cattle in the >19 M group were\nestimated to be screened with a certain test sensitivity (Seb) using bulk tank milk once a year. In the default setting, bulk milk tests were not performed (Seb was zero), and this was changed to\napproximately 95% in the scenario models. Under Japanese legislation, when any cattle in a herd are diagnosed with BVD, all of the cattle in the herd are mandatorily tested for BVDV infection either by RT-PCR or virus isolation\nmethod using serum samples as an outbreak investigation of a newly infected herd. In the present model, all of the cattle except those in which BVD was detected by any clinical manifestation, by the individual compulsory test, and\nby the screening test, were assumed to be tested within the outbreak investigation with a probability of 0.3% (Po), which was calculated by the number of infected herds to that of all the herds in Nemuro.

When compared in the same vaccination program, the differences in the number of detected and missed BVD cattle between 10 and 50% were smaller under the vaccine programs incorporating a\ngreater number of vaccine administrations. We compared the efficacies of the individual test prior to communal pasture grazing and bulk milk tests under the vaccination strategy so as to estimate which rates of use in communal\npasture tests would be equally effective to the screening test using bulk tank milk. The numbers of detected cattle by the bulk tank milk tests under single-, double- and triple-administrations were almost equal to those of BVD\ncattle in 20, 30 and 30% use rates of communal pasture tests, respectively. In parallel, the numbers of missed cattle by the bulk tank milk tests under these three vaccination scenarios were almost equal to those of detected BVD\ncattle in 50, 40 and 40% use rates of communal pasture tests respectively. Considering these results together, during the early phase of the vaccination program, it was indicated that the efficacy of the communal pasture test with\nlow use rates would be equal to that of the bulk milk tests, whereas at the later phase of the vaccination program, the efficacy of the bulk milk test would not be inferior to that of the communal pasture test with low coverage\nrates.

Moreover, the Norwegian government banned the use of the vaccination for pestiviruses as the vaccination could prevent the manifestation of severe clinical manifestations, but did not prevent the spread of\nthe virus [24]. In these countries, cattle with antibodies against BVDV as potential risk of BVD spread is easily monitored but it can also cull no-virus-shedding cattle which was transiently\ninfected in past. In Japan, on the other hand, we are monitoring virus-shedding cattle and adopt the vaccination so as to prevent the further virus spread. According to the results of the present study, it was revealed that the\nadoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. This may indicate that, in an area where no interventions for BVD control have been implemented,\nthe adoption of the mass vaccination campaign would be the foremost intervention for BVD control to reduce the number of cattle infected with BVDV. In the present model, herd immunity conferred by mass vaccination did not affect the\nnumber of PI cattle, but did affect the number of TI cattle due to a decrease of the sensitive population. Under system of no BVD monitoring, PI cattle would not be detected without showing obvious clinical manifestations, such as\nreproductive disorder. Given these considerations, the missed BVD cattle under the mass vaccination program would be the TI cattle of any age or PI heifers. As these diseased cattle usually do not show obvious clinical\nmanifestations, it is likely that undetected cattle would be left for a period, thereby allowing the shedding of infectious viruses. Even TI cattle would be a source of BVDV spread, resulting in horizontal and vertical infection\nover a limited duration.",

Therefore, monitoring of infected cattle in parallel with the implementation of mass vaccination should be an\neffective intervention to reduce the risk of BVD in the population. In Nemuro, an individual test using a serum sample is mandatory applied to all cattle that use communal pastures [29]. In\nJapan, the use of communal pasture for summer grazing is common in any age of dairy cattle, including pregnant cows; therefore, the spread of BVDV infection horizontally or vertically in communal pastures has been suspected. An\nindividual test prior to communal pasture grazing can detect young PI heifers that normally rarely show clinical manifestations; however, there are practical difficulties associated with adopting this test for a larger number of\ntargeted cattle. On the other hand, the bulk tank milk test can be applied for a large number of animals, and some of the reports have already evaluated the efficacy of the bulk tank milk test [4, 18, 21]. As the target of the bulk tank milk test is lactating cows, this test is unlikely to detect the young PI heifers. Given that\nadoption of mass vaccination cannot contribute to a decrease of PI animals in the population, the individual test rather than the bulk tank milk test is more effective to reduce PI cattle immediately after conducting the mass\nvaccination. This consideration may support the results showing that the efficacy of the individual test with a lower coverage was equal to that of the bulk tank milk test in the present study. Comparison of efficacies between the\nindividual test and screening test appears to be affected by some factors, including test sensitivity, virus prevalence, and distribution of targeted animals. Input of suitable data to the disease model as well as collection of\naccurate data in the field is necessary to reach a confidential output so as to contribute to the selection of a more effective intervention.",

However, if animal-level prevalence of BVD becomes lower, it would be likely that the cost-effectiveness of the screening test using bulk tank milk would be higher due to lower between-herd prevalence. This would be because\nimplementation of outbreak investigation could eradicate the BVD cattle in premises, thereby decrease of BVD cattle would affect to between-herd prevalence but not to within-herd prevalence in infected premises.
