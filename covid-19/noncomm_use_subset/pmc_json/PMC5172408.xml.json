Sixteen complete or partial genome sequences of SARS-CoV isolates have been available since March 14 this year (ref. 2., 3., 4., 5.; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; Table 1). In the process of surveying all available genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV, we have obtained the complete genomic sequence of an isolate, named Isolate GZ01 originally. The sequence contains an extra 29-nucleotide segment in the vicinity of the viral structural proteins, M (the membrane protein) and N (the nucleocapsid protein). We have renamed the isolate as GD-Ins29 to indicate the origin, length, and the type of mutation. We believe that this novel genotype represents one of the early variants of the SARS-CoV. The absence of the 29-nt fragment may help the virus to escape the likely interference from locally homologous RNA molecules of host origin and to become more prevalent in human hosts. This sequence also holds unusually high number of variations among all the sequenced SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting a more distant relationship from other sequences SARS-CoV genomes published thus far.",

We annotated two new PUPs, BGI-PUP5 (so named to avoid possible ambiguity in nomenclature) and BGI-PUP6, located between the previously reported PUP4 and the N protein. These PUPs overlap in a 35-nt region (position 27,843 and 27,879, in reference to nucleotide position in the complete sequence of BJ01). Both PUPs share the same consensus leader sequence (5\u2032-agUCUAAAAGAAC-3\u2032) that is immediately followed by the predicted start codon of BGI-PUP5, and approximately 95-nt away from that of BGI-PUP6.

Among them, 25 clones were sequenced from both ends. No other sequence variations were found in the sequences from this particular amplicon-library, even though minor variants are occasionally seen in other amplicon-libraries from different sequences due to minor variations from viral populations and, to a much less extent, RT-PCR generated aberrant products. We have also identified another SARS-CoV isolate that harbors the same sequence segment from a SARS patient in Guangdong Province.

The unique 17-nt sequence that we have discovered from the human genome as mRNA forms is thought to be capable of annealing specifically with the negative sense strand of the viral RNA while the virus is replicating its RNA genomes from the negative sense RNA genome intermediates and transcribing viral transcripts for the replicase and structural proteins, thus interfere with the viral life cycle by reducing the efficiency of both viral replication and transcription. The prerequisite for the interference to happen is that the 17-nt sequence comes from a protein or RNA coding sequence that exists in infected human cells with reasonable abundance. It is very suggestive that the interaction of the intermediate viral genome products, namely the negative sense RNAs, and the host RNA species might have happened in the propagation processes within a host of SARS-CoV, through intermolecular RNA-RNA recombination (8).",

Special attention was paid to the sequences of the mutation sites and multiple clones from the amplicon-libraries constructed from multiple independent RT-PCR products were sequenced. A substantial portion (70.4%, 100/142) of the substitutions was predicted to be non-synonymous mutations in the ORFs, including 14 in the PUPs. Among the 92 substitutions detected in the R (replicase) protein, 70.7% (65/92) could lead to amino acid changes. Although the S (spike) protein has a low ratio (13/22), the ratio is higher in the other structural proteins, the M (4/4) and N proteins (3/4), as well as in BGI-PUP2 (4/5), BGI-PUP3 (2/2), and BGI-PUP (GD-Ins29, 2/2). Even though a large fraction of substitutions in the viral genome have been located in the ORF for the R protein, its substitution rate is actually the lowest among all the defined CDSs, with regard to its large size (21,222 nt). The mutation rate of SARS-CoV is quite high if we take into consideration such a short time period since it was identified from human hosts. A high mutation rate is consistent with the high error rate of RNA replication (9) and the high fraction of non-synonymous substitutions also implies the possibility that the selective pressure from the host may have worked on the virus, albeit there is very little statistical power to support the conjecture with current data set. A very important notion from our data (including tens of thousands of sequencing traces) is the obvious absence of indels (insertions and deletions), suggesting that the viral polymerase is prone to the replication errors in proofreading but remains relatively accurate in frame-moving conveyed by the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) activity.",

The phylogenetic tree positioned Isolate GD01 in the group composed of BJ01, 02, 03, and 04, two of the Hong Kong isolates (CUHK), and the US isolate (Urbani). This paradigm suggests a possible transmission path among Guangdong, Hong Kong, Beijing and USA. The link between the two isolates (TOR2 and HKU) in another group has been suggested that the Toronto patient, from whom the isolate was obtained, was known to have traveled from Hong Kong (3). In addition, the five isolates identified in Singapore seem to form another group. Two relatively distant isolates in Taiwan and Zhejiang, China, reported more recently, are more distant from the rest. Additional molecular epidemiological data, based on genomic sequences of viral isolates identified from different regions, is essential to elucidate the possible routes of global spreading and mutation during its transmission among humans.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV has nearly identical genome organization, especially its gene order, with other members in Coronaviridae found in humans and other animals. The sequences of the SARS-CoV genome from various isolates are also almost identical with only a few dozen nucleotide substitutions per genome compared with each other. Therefore, we are strongly in favor of the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV may have originated from non-human animals, no matter it is virulent or latent to its host, in unknown reservoirs of the wild and recently moved onto humans through a less frequently established contacting route. It is of great importance that such non-human hosts should be promptly identified in order to prevent further evasion into human and other animal populations. The discovery of the GD-Ins29 genotype is very useful in differentiating the origin of SARS-CoV. The fact that we have only identified a couple of isolates in Guangdong Province supports the scenario that GD-Ins29 is the original form transmitted from non-human host to human ones and later turned into a new genotype after deletion of a DNA segment that may hinders its efficiency of propagation. Therefore, we predict two likely outcomes when surveying the animal reservoirs. First, the non-human reservoir of SARS-CoV may harbor genome sequences close to GD-Ins29, not the deleted form or the major genotype found most widespread among its human hosts. Second, both variants of the major and the minor genotypes could be found in the same animal reservoir owing to multiple transmissions of the virus back and forth between its human and non-human hosts.",

            "text": "Alternatively, there might have been at least two genotypes of SARS-CoV spreading in non-human host populations and they have infected human hosts as separate events. It is unlikely but possible that the virus have infected humans multiple times in a not-distant past and the two genotypes co-exist in the non-human hosts but not traceable in current human populations. Although we cannot rule out another possibility that the viruses of the major genotype had acquired a 29-nt sequence and become GD-Ins29 genotype during its propagation in human hosts, such event is deemed extremely rare since insertion or deletion is often lethal to the virus that have a rather compact genome.",

High-quality sequences were assembled by using a sequence assembly package, Phred-Phrap-Consed (10). The consensus sequences from different amplicon-derived clones are accounted and minor variations among different clones are ignored for the consensus assembly. A total number of 75 amplicons and 2,718 sequencing reads were generated (1,538,993 bp of raw data), equivalent to approximately 52-fold coverage of the viral genome. A complete sequence of 29.757 Kb with an overall error rate of 0.0016% was obtained. The sequence of Isolate GD01 is available in GenBank (Accession No. AY278489).",
