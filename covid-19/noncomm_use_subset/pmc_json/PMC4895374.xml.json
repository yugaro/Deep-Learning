            "text": "Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common acquired cardiac disease in dogs and the most common cause of congestive heart failure in dogs. Chronic valvular disease will lead to valvular insufficiency, cardiac enlargement, and sometimes contractile dysfunction in the later stages of the disease. As the disease progresses, the amount of valvular regurgitation increases, eventually leading to volume overload, pulmonary venous congestion, and finally congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema. The common histologic findings seen in myxomatous valves include disarray of the collagen and elastin fibers as well as disruption of the microstructure within the valves. This disarray and disorganization is partly a result of phenotypic transdifferentiation of the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) from quiescent fibroblastic cells to myofibroblastic\u2010like cells, which follows the classical paradigm of fibrogenesis. As the transformation takes place, the VIC density decreases, and these cells then express alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2010SMA) instead of vimentin. Similarly, TGF\u03b2 stimulation of VICs in vitro results in fibroblastic (vimentinhigh+, \u03b1SMAlow+) to myofibrolastic (vimentinlow+, \u03b1SMAhigh+) transition. Given that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can exert anti\u2010fibrotic effects, we investigated the effects of conditioned media (CM) derived from canine Wharton's Jelly MSCs (WJ\u2010MSC) on the growth potential of canine VICs and its ability to counter the effects of TGF\u03b2. VICs were isolated and cultured from normal and diseased valves. Immunohistochemistry and real\u2010time (q\u2010) PCR were used to evaluate the expression of \u03b1SMA, vimentin, elastin, and collagen in VICs. CM was collected from WJ\u2010MSC culture, and CM exosomes were isolated by either ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation. Cell growth and replicative capacity were evaluated using MTT assay and colony forming units (CFU). Internalization of WJ\u2010MSC exosomes by VICs was imaged with membrane or RNA staining. qPCR showed that diseased valve VICs had increased myofibroblastic phenotype and decreased cell growth by MTT and CFU. Culturing of VICs of either phenotype with WJ\u2010MSC CM or exosomes alone resulted in increased number of viable cells, and depletion of exosomes had the opposite effect. Exosomal membrane and RNA labelling confirmed exosome uptake into VIC cytoplasm and nucleus, although RNA containing exosomes were internalized by <20% of VICs, implying selective endocytosis of RNA containing exosomes or they are less numerous. Increase in responsiveness to TGF\u03b21 stimulation when VICs were cultured in CM was noted. WJ\u2010MSC CM or its exosomes improve cell growth for VICs isolated from both normal and diseased canine mitral valves and may exert protective effects on VICs to slow the progression of canine MMVD.",

            "text": "Multiple pathologies of the dog spine require stabilization with vertebral implants. Optimal implant corridors are described and vary between specific vertebrae throughout the spine. Current placement guidelines use general surface landmarks and proposed angles without opportunity to visualize vital structures at depth. Preferred corridors are often inaccessible because of soft tissue impediment. Potential complications of vertebral implant placement include neuro\u2010vascular compromise or insufficient bone purchase for required biomechanical loads. Trans\u2010articular implants present the added challenge of aligning a vertebral motion units and countering biomechanical stresses. Recent reports suggest the frequency of spinal canal violation by vertebral implants is high. Frameless stereotaxy for brain neuronavigation has been described in veterinary literature and validation studies show a high level of accuracy. These techniques utilize high resolution cross sectional imaging to create 3D data sets. Identification of fiducial markers visible on 3D models (image space) and on the subject intraoperatively (anatomic space) permits fusion for co\u2010localizing guidance. A position sensor is used to track, in real\u2010time, reflective instruments affixed to the skull and surgical tools within a virtual space. The surgeon can identify any point within that virtual space for tissue sampling or treatment. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique for implant placements in the dog spine using image\u2010guided intervention. Unlike the brain, which is encased within the solid calvarium and once registered with the navigation software, all structures can be reliably identified relative to the origin of the coordinate system; There are two major obstacles when considering neuronavigation of the vertebral column. First, multiple vertebral motion units require individual registration. The vertebral column is made of multiple articulating bones, making a single bone registration inapplicable for the remaining vertebrae. A novel subject tracker was created for attachment to single vertebra for individual registration. The second obstacle in adapting frameless neuronavigation to the spine is the assignment of fiducial markers. Current brain protocols require pre\u2010imaging procedures for placement of artificial fiducial makers rigidly affixed to the skull or teeth. Pre\u2010imaging surgery and affixing fiducial arrays is logistically difficult in spinal applications. For this reason, identification of natural boney fiducial markers identifiable in both image and anatomic space is preferable. Evaluated landmarks included spinous processes, accessory processes and cranial costovertebral joints. Initially a cadaveric study validating the technique in the thoracolumbar spine was performed. Qualitative measures of canal compromise and bone purchase in addition to quantitative measures of trajectory and depth were evaluated. Safety and efficacy findings of zero canal violations, statistically accurate placement, and mostly cross\u2010body implants warranted clinical use. Completed clinical cases included three thoracolumbar fractures with vertebral body screws, two atlantoaxial stabilizations and three lumbosacral stabilizations with transarticular screws. Stereotactic guidance enabled the surgeon to visualize cross\u2010sectional implantation in real time. All cases had post\u2010operative imaging with adequate placement of implants and satisfactory clinical outcomes. The described adaptation provides a means of safe and effective placement of vertebral implants. Multiple trajectories could be created with the computerized guidance. Subjectively less soft tissue dissection was necessary and surgical time was minimally extended.",

All patients had systemic evaluations to demonstrate no significant findings, MRI evaluations to demonstrate no significant changes in the central nervous system, and CSF analysis revealing no abnormalities. Many patients experienced cluster seizures requiring emergency interventions to control the seizures. No further adjustments to medications were made during the study, although some anticonvulsants could be reduced once the PLA bead treatment was given. An EEG was performed in dexmedetomidine\u2010sedated dogs (10\u201315 \u03bcg/kg) before and after PLA bead placement and analyzed by a statistical package (NeuroStat package of NeuroGuide by Applied Neuroscience, Inc., Seminole, FL). PLA beads were placed in transpositional and classical acupuncture points by a certified veterinary acupuncturist (Chi Institute, Reddick, FL). The injection sites were wiped with ethyl alcohol gel (Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer, Gojo Industries, Akron, OH) and the PLA beads inserted using a modified 16 ga needle and syringe.

We later recognized that this is a period of time when patients are most likely to seizure and it was speculated that this was a consequence of the healing from the implantation procedure before the bead took over the protection. One patient who had severe clusters every 13 days prior to bead implantation remained seizure free for 4 years (using re\u2010implantation of beads every 6 months). From preliminary investigations, we found that the bead implantation lasted about 8 months on average, so patients were re\u2010implanted every 6 months, based upon owner's desires. EEG examinations of patients prior to implantation showed slow\u2010wave, high\u2010amplitude activity with occasional epileptiform discharges and spike activity.

A very mild form of XLMD has recently been identified in several related male Labrador Retrievers with markedly elevated CK activity detected at the time of neuter. No clinical evidence of weakness or muscle atrophy is observed. Muscle biopsies show a dystrophic phenotype and dystrophin is not detectable by western blot. What is protecting these dogs from the devastating effects of dystrophin deficiency is yet to be determined. A myopathy with progressive gait abnormalities and multiple joint deformities was recently identified associated with sarcolemmal specific collagen VI deficiency (2014), similar to that of human Ulrich's congenital muscular dystrophy. The mutation has been confirmed in COL6A3 but not yet published. Although not a myopathy, the syndrome of exercise\u2010induced collapse has been characterized and a mutation in the CNS specific DNM1 gene described (2008).

While current therapies induce remission in most na\u00efve dogs with lymphoma, drug\u2010resistant relapse is common and there is a distinct need for novel agents. The acyclic nucleotide phosphonate 9\u2010(2\u2010phosphonylmethoxyethyl)\u2010guanine (PMEG) forms an active phosphorylated metabolite, PMEGpp, in cells and causes cytotoxicity in dividing cells due to inhibition of DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b5; however, PMEG's use as an anticancer agent is limited by poor cellular permeability and nonspecific toxicity. Rabacfosadine (VDC\u20101101/GS\u20109219/TANOVEA\u2122), a novel double prodrug of PMEG, was designed to preferentially target lymphoid cells with significantly reduced systemic toxicity. Rabacfosadine has been administered on a variety of dosing schedules to dogs with lymphoma. Objective responses were noted in 100% of chemotherapy\u2010na\u00efve dogs and 60% of refractory dogs, with a median remission duration of 128 days. Given the ease of administration and equivalent activity with a q21\u2010day administration schedule, we sought to generate additional data regarding efficacy of this regimen through completion of a prospective clinical trial.

However, this relationship in dogs has not been thoroughly evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether body condition score (BCS) at the time of lymphoma (LSA) or osteosarcoma (OSA) diagnosis in dogs was predictive of survival time (ST). We hypothesized that an overweight BCS at the time of cancer diagnosis would be associated with a shorter ST. Medical records of dogs diagnosed and treated for LSA or OSA between 2000 and 2010 were reviewed. Data on signalment, body weight, BCS, treatment, and survival were collected. Dogs were grouped by BCS (underweight, normal, and overweight) and STs were compared using Kaplan\u2010Meier survival analysis. A total of 325 dogs (LSA = 270 and OSA = 55) were included in the study. Overall, 5.5% of dogs were underweight, 54.2% were normal weight, and 40.3% were overweight. On univariate analysis, ST was significantly shorter for underweight dogs with LSA (P = 0.017), but not for OSA (P = 0.518). Dogs with LSA that gained >10% body weight after diagnosis had a longer ST (P = 0.003). On multivariate analysis of all dogs, change in body weight (P < 0.001) and anemia (P = 0.026), but not BCS group, were significantly associated with ST. In conclusion, although no relationship between BCS and ST was detected, changes in body weight after diagnosis were associated with ST.",

Median body weight at diagnosis was 4.2 kg (range, 1.6\u20139.9 kg). Cats lost a median of 8.9% of body weight in the 12 months before diagnosis, but weight loss began as early as 3 years before diagnosis and accelerated after diagnosis of CKD.

We have also demonstrated that serum SDMA allows for earlier detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats and dogs when compared with serum creatinine. In general, serum SDMA and creatinine concentrations correlate with each other (R2 \u02dc 0.7\u20130.9). However in some CKD patients, SDMA concentrations increased disproportionately compared with serum creatinine. This discordance is seen in both cats and dogs, but the prevalence is much higher in cats. This observed discordance in CKD patients can be quantified in terms of a SDMA to creatinine ratio; the higher the ratio the greater the discordance. Although the typical SDMA to creatinine ratio is <10 in the majority of animals with CKD, we have observed that the larger the SDMA to creatinine ratio (>10) in CKD patients, the greater the chance of mortality. It should be noted that the ratio only applies to CKD animals; dogs and cats with creatinine and/or SDMA concentrations within normal limits can have ratios >10.

Conversely, dysfunctional CD8+ T cells exhibit altered patterns of methylation and acetylation, and failure of complete differentiation, suggesting that there are early transcriptional events contributing to the induction of CD8+ T cell dysfunction. For many persistent viral infections such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Rotavirus (RV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), virus specific CD8+ T cell activation is followed by the induction of CD8+ T cell dysfunction, which is characterized by lack of interleukin\u20102 (IL2) production and poor proliferation following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Loss of IL2 production signals the onset of a progressive decline in cytokine production and antiviral function. Using the feline immunodeficiency model (FIV) for lentiviral persistence, we have clearly demonstrated that virus\u2010activated CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells provide a strong inhibitory signal and induce cell cycle arrest and down\u2010regulation of IL2 in activated CD8+ lymphocyte targets early and progressively during the course of infection. Further, we have shown that Treg cells are activated by FIV infection and induce the expression of the repressive transcription factor Foxp3 in CD8+ T cell targets following Treg cell / CD8+ coculture. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that Foxp3 can bind the IL2 promoter in \u201cbulk\u201d (virus non\u2010specific) CD8+ T cells and that blocking epigenetic rearrangements prevents Foxp3 binding to the IL2 promoter in virus non\u2010specific CD8+ T cells.",

Our hypothesis is that activated Treg cells exploit virus\u2010induced epigenetic changes in CD8+ T cells to cause dysfunction. The purpose of these investigations was to demonstrate that Foxp3 binds the IL2 promoter in virus specific CD8+ T cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and bisulfite reduction of DNA, we have assessed histone acetylation and DNA demethylation at the IL2 promoter region in virus specific CD8+ T cells from FIV+ cats. Briefly, virus specific T cells were identified by ex\u2010vivo proliferation in response to inactivated virus. These cells were then purified and co\u2010cultured with autologous Treg cells. In concert with our previous work in virus non\u2010specific CD8+ T cells, our data suggests that following coculture with autologous Treg cells, virus specific CD8+ T cells exhibit increased Foxp3 mRNA and decreased IL2 mRNA by RT\u2010qPCR (n = 2). More importantly, our most recent ChIP studies demonstrate that Foxp3 binds the IL2 promoter in virus specific CD8+ T cells from FIV+ cats following Treg cell coculture (n = 2). Collectively, these results suggest that it will be possible to block epigenetic rearrangements in virus specific CD8+ T cells thereby blocking Foxp3 binding to the IL2 promoter. These mechanistic studies will provide a new avenue of investigation for restoring antiviral CD8+ T cell function during the course of persistent viral infection.",

We hypothesized that 1) excess glycogen and/or improper regulation of glycogen synthase results in altered gene expression in skeletal muscle energy metabolism pathways leading to rhabdomyolysis in PSSM1; and 2) that clinical improvement with daily exercise is due to normalization of gene expression in PSSM1 horses. Gluteal muscle biopsies were collected from PSSM1 cases and controls on a high starch diet prior to training (t1), before (t2) and immediately after exercise (t3) following a standardized 3\u2010week training protocol. RNA was isolated and sequenced at 40\u2010million reads/sample; reads were mapped to EquCab2 and de novo assembly was performed to identify novel transcripts. Differential gene expression was measured by Edge\u2010R. 195, 294 and 739 genes were differentially expressed between cases and controls at t1, t2 and t3, respectively. The largest differences in expression were in cases between t1\u2010t3 (4,822 genes) and t2\u2010t3 (2,474 genes). Genes involved in glycogen metabolism, glycolysis and mitochondrial electron transport were differentially expressed between cases and controls. Understanding altered energy regulation in PSSM1 should lead to new therapies and new insights in metabolic myopathies and muscle glycogen regulation.",

Inhalation of a variety of environmental allergens induces chronic non\u2010infectious respiratory inflammation, leading to hyper\u2010responsiveness of the lower airways, increased production of mucus and airway remodeling. Swelling and narrowing of the airways leads to decreased lung function and limited gas exchange. There is evidence that many cells and structures of the lung play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease: the contribution of bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, lymphoid and myeloid cells has been well documented. The interaction of an allergen with resident innate immune cells induces the arrival of more inflammatory cells, via cytokines and chemokines. Once the inflammatory reaction has fulfilled its task, pro\u2010resolutive mechanisms take the stage: the shut\u2010down of chemokine signaling leads to the abrogation of inflammatory cell influx (mainly neutrophils). Neutrophils initiate their apoptotic program and release molecules that attract macrophages, which in turn perform neutrophil clearance. The phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils eventually reprograms macrophages towards an anti\u2010inflammatory phenotype. The successful completion of the pro\u2010resolutive mechanism leads to the restoration of tissue homeostasis.

Subsequently, 9 horses instrumented with lamellar and skin microdialysis probes were subjected to sequential interventions designed to modify tissue perfusion (4 interventions) and limb load cycling activity and weight bearing (4 interventions). Urea (20 mmol/L) was added to the perfusion fluid to investigate if urea clearance (UC; a microdialysis\u2010based method used to assess local blood flow) could identify lamellar perfusion changes. Energy metabolite concentrations, UC, and the standard indices of energy metabolism lactate to glucose (L:G) and lactate to pyruvate (L:P) ratios were determined during each intervention. Then, changes in lamellar bioenergetic composition and perfusion during the development of experimentally induced, sepsis\u2010associated laminitis were investigated in 12 horses. Treatment (n = 6) and control (n = 6) horses received oligofructose (OF) and water via nasogastric tube. Lamellar metabolite composition, L:G, L:P and UC were determined bihourly and compared. Lastly, using lamellar and skin dialysate and tissue sections from healthy horses (n = 7), and lamellar dialysate from OFT (n = 4) and CON (n = 4) horses, targeted metabolomic analysis (i.e. 44 central carbon metabolites: CCM) was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS).

In the OF study, glucose decreased significantly in OFT lamellar dialysate (OFT\u2010L), and was consistently lower in OFT than in CON horses. Lactate was higher in OFT skin (OFT\u2010S) compared with OFT\u2010L. Pyruvate decreased significantly in OFT\u2010L and was significantly less than CON\u2010L. L:G and L:P increased significantly in OFT\u2010L and OFT\u2010S, but not CON\u2010L. Urea decreased significantly (increased UC) in OFT\u2010L and remained stable in CON\u2010L. Hyperaemia rather than ischaemia together with some bioenergetic disturbances occurred during the developmental phase of OF\u2010induced laminitis. Though perfusion increased, lamellar glucose was markedly reduced, which could have compromised lamellar basal epithelial cell metabolism despite the lack of definitive evidence of lamellar bioenergetic failure. Metabolomic analysis of lamellar and skin dialysate showed no difference in metabolite composition in these two tissues in healthy horses, and the metabolome of dialysate and tissue samples was also found to be similar. A difference in CCM between OFT and CON horses was observed. Metabolomic analysis of lamellar CCM was capable of differentiating OFT from CON horses. Lamellar malate, pyruvate, aconitate and glycolate, were identified as the source of differentiation between OFT and CON groups.",

This study aimed to identify a suitable, non\u2010radioactive immunoassay for equine C\u2010peptide and compare C\u2010peptide secretion following oral and IV dextrose administration in ponies. Seven assays were assessed for precision, accuracy and specificity. Only one assay was deemed acceptable and was used to measure the response of nine ponies to oral and IV dextrose (0.75 mg/kg). The ponies were designated as insulin\u2010resistant (IR) or insulin\u2010sensitive (IS) based on fasted glucose\u2010to\u2010insulin ratios and oral glucose tests. C\u2010peptide concentrations increased rapidly from fasted levels following both oral (P < 0.01) and IV (P < 0.001) dextrose, with similar AUC for both tests. C\u2010peptide and insulin concentrations were correlated (P < 0.05), when AUC were compared. The AUCC\u2010peptide was similar in IR and IS ponies for IV dextrose. However, the AUCC\u2010peptide for oral dextrose was 7\u2010fold higher (P < 0.05) in IR, compared to IS ponies. Insulin clearance (fractional difference to C\u2010peptide) was greater for the oral test, and in IS ponies 60 minutes after dextrose administration, for both tests. Whereas C\u2010peptide and insulin responses to IV dextrose indicated that pancreatic capacity was similar for both groups, only IR ponies maintained this magnitude of response to oral dextrose. Increased insulin secretion is a major component of hyperinsulinaemia, although reduced clearance also appears to contribute, with increased capacity for insulin response to oral carbohydrate in IR ponies.",

To investigate whether this may be true for equine heaves, we characterized the tracheal microbiomes of three healthy horses and five horses with historical, clinical and/or bronchoalveolar lavage cytological findings consistent with heaves. On two occasions, approximately 2 weeks apart, tracheal aspirate (TA) samples were collected transendoscopically using a two\u2010stage sampling catheter. Total genomic DNA was extracted from one aliquot and DNA integrity verified by PCR amplification of the horse mitochondrial cox1 gene. Total bacterial load was estimated by quantitative PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, and PCR amplicon libraries based on the universal 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60) gene were prepared using established protocols and sequenced using the 454 GS Junior pyrosequencing platform. Sequences were assembled into operational taxonomic units (OTU) and compared to the cpnDB reference database (www.cpndb.ca) to identify the closest reference sequence (nearest neighbor) for each OTU. Phylum assignment of OTU sequences was based on the taxonomic lineage of the nearest cpnDB reference sequence. Alpha and beta diversity were calculated using QIIME, and hierarchical clustering of microbiome profiles was performed in R. A second aliquot of each sample underwent routine microbiologic analysis using aerobic culture on blood and McConkey agar plates, followed by biochemical testing and identification. Up to 12 colonies per microbiologic culture plate were amplified using cpn60 universal primer PCR, sequenced and compared to the microbiome library from the corresponding horse.",

A total of 94,800 sequence reads were analyzed (median 1,488 per sample; range 137\u201335,926). Consistent with the 16S rRNA copy number, microbiomes of horses with heaves appeared to have higher species richness than those of healthy horses. Microbiome profiles of horses in both clinical categories were dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. OTU sequences corresponded to 329 nearest neighbor reference sequences. OTU with similarity to Pseudomonas fluorescens, Rothia spp., Pantoea agglomerans, and Streptococcus spp. were the most prevalent among all samples and were frequently the most abundant in individual microbiomes. Both phylum level profiles and hierarchical clustering of OTU level profiles based on Bray\u2010Curtis dissimilarity showed that microbiome profiles of individual horses were largely similar between the two samplings, and that microbiomes did not cluster by clinical category. Sequence data were obtained from 51 bacterial colonies, which represented 35 unique sequences. Only 8/35 of these sequences were >99% identical to OTU in the relevant microbiome libraries. Species identified by both culture and microbiome sequencing included only Firmicutes and represented only 6.7% of the sequence data generated from all horses, consistent with the more comprehensive view of the microbiome provided by the culture\u2010independent approach.",

Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to compare the pathogenicity and shedding of clinical US isolates of all three genotypes (A, B, C). Sixteen weaned Jersey bull calves seronegative to PI3 were randomly assigned to one of four groups; calves were challenged intranasally with approximately 107 CCID50 of one of the PI3 genotypes or served as negative controls. The calves were maintained in isolation rooms and daily nasal swab collection and observation for signs of disease by a blinded investigator were performed throughout the 14\u2010day study. Mild clinical signs were observed similarly in all challenged groups and included serous nasal discharge and coughing. Onset of nasal shedding differed between groups with all PI3\u2010A challenged calves shedding beginning on Day 4, 3 of 4 PI3\u2010B challenged calves on Day 5, and PI3\u2010C challenged calves on Day 6.

The objectives were: 1\u2010 to compare JD prevalence between Pennsylvania organic and conventional dairy farms, and 2\u2010 to identify risk factors associated with differences in JD prevalence. A JD milk ELISA was performed on individual milk samples from each lactating cows in the study herds. Information regarding management practices was collected during a farm visit. Overall herd prevalence, and within\u2010herd prevalence were compared between groups. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with differences in JD prevalence between groups. A total of 2,739 cows from 50 herds (25 organic and 25 conventional) were included in the study. Median herd size was 58 (range 20\u2013114 cows) for conventional farms, and 39 (range 20\u2013211 cows) for organic farms. Of all the farms included in the study, 27/50 (54%) were positive, with 15/25 (60%) positive conventional farms and 12/25 (48%) positive organic farms. From the conventional farms, 25/1,506 (2%) cows were positive, compared with 28/1,233 (2%) cows from organic herds. After adjusting for herd size, there was no significant difference in herd prevalence (P = 0.56), or within\u2010herd prevalence (P = 0.41) between conventional and organic farms. Risk factors are currently being analyzed. Preliminary results indicate that there is no difference in JD prevalence between Pennsylvania organic and conventional dairy farms.",

An excessive demand for nutrients due to the increased performance required for milk production results in a negative energy balance. One major adjustment consists in the rapid mobilization of energy sources from tissue depots in the form of non\u2010esterified fatty acids. Cows poorly adapting to NEB are at high risk of developing disease. Many transition period diseases, including fatty liver, occur in a subclinical form, affecting milk production and reproductive performance of dairy cows.
