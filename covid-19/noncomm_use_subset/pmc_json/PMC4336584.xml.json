When combined with improved techniques for DNA transfer and the rapid targeted alteration of biosynthetic genes this provide a powerful platform for focused drug discovery efforts with the aim of improving drug-like properties, pharmacokinetics and reducing off-target effects. These bioengineering techniques are readily combined with semisynthesis to identify molecules with further improved properties.

However, cyclophilins recruited from host cells have been shown to have essential roles in many viral life-cycles. Initially, cyclophilin A was shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions14,15, involved in viral replication, and its expression level in patients related to the speed of progression to AIDS16. Cyclophilin A isomerase activity, and potentially other cyclophilins such as B and cyclophilin 40, have been shown to be required for HCV replication17\u201319. Other viruses where cyclophilin involvement has been implicated in their life-cycle, or where cyclophilin inhibitors have shown inhibitory activity, include Vaccinia virus20, West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Yellow fever virus21, Hepatitis B virus22, Human papilloma virus23, Cytomegalovirus24, SARS coronavirus25, Japanese encephalitis virus26 and Influenza A27.",

This approach moved the immunosuppressive NPs from tool compounds appropriate for chemical genetics to being compounds that could reasonably be pursued as therapeutic agents. We then used bioengineering to make further alterations to the macrocyclic portion of the molecule, changes which could not have otherwise been done without complex total synthesis. The major aim of this work was to further improve the drug-like properties of the final molecule by specific manipulation of the parts of the molecule involved in cyclophilin binding.",

It is this inhibition which is now thought to be the mechanism for the dose limiting hyperbilirubinaemia34. These compounds also have drug-drug interaction concerns through inhibition of xenobiotic transporters such as Pgp and BSEP35,36. Comparison of the inhibition of these transporters using vesicular transport or uptake transporter inhibition assays, and in vitro inhibition of the xenobiotic transporters, Pgp and BSEP revealed that whilst alisporivir and CsA potently inhibited many of them, BC544 (figure 1, previously stated as compound 3o in Moss et al., 2011) and NVP018 showed minimal or no inhibition (see table 2). To test the effect of NVP018 on bilirubin levels, we then dosed three mice with up to 250 mg/kg/day NVP018 for 7 days.

Cyclophilin inhibition is one of the few mechanisms of action of HCV inhibition which consistently shows a high barrier to resistance, and in Phase 2 trials, some patients were clear of the virus after being treated for 24 weeks with 1000 mg/day alisporivir monotherapy39.

Comparison of the inhibitory potential of NVP018 with the semisynthetic sangamide, BC544 and alisporivir against HCV replicons revealed that NVP018 was much more potent in all assays, and was similarly active against all genotypes tested (see table 3).

These are frequently used independently, but in the past have been less commonly used together42,43. This enabled a combinatorial approach to natural product drug discovery and led to the selection of NVP018, a compound with more potent cyclophilin inhibition, antiviral potency versus HBV, HCV and HIV-1, and reduced off-target transporter inhibition as compared to the parent compound, sanglifehrin A. A fluorine was introduced into the compound by mutasynthesis, a method which has been successful in introducing this substitution pattern in a less invasive way than semisynthetic chemistry44,45,46,47,48.",

This is due to their potency, high barrier to resistance, activity on multiple steps of the viral life-cycle and oral bioavailability. It is also worth noting the recent publications which suggest that these compounds might also have additional impact on Interferon Regulatory Factors, which have long been implicated in the escape of certain viruses, such as HCV and HIV, from the immune system49,50. Whilst cyclophilin inhibitors do not exhibit inhibition of all viruses, they have been shown to have activity against a wide variety of both RNA viruses (eg Coronaviruses, HIV and HCV) and DNA viruses (HCMV, HBV, VZV). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cyclophilin inhibitors may be a step in the direction of agents with broad antiviral activity51.",

The PPIase activity of recombinant CypA, produced by thrombin cleavage of GST-CypA, is determined by following the rate of hydrolysis of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin only hydrolyzes the trans form of the peptide, and hydrolysis of the cis form, the concentration of which is maximized by using a stock dissolved in trifluoroethanol containing 470 mM LiCl, is limited by the rate of cis-trans isomerization. CypA was equilibrated for 1 hour at 5 \u00b0C with selected sanglifehrin derivatives using a drug concentration range from 0.1 to 20 nM. The reaction was started by addition of the peptide, and the change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 10 data points per sec. The blank rates of hydrolysis (in the absence of CypA) were subtracted from the rates in the presence of CypA. The initial rates of the enzymatic reaction were analyzed by first-order regression analysis of the time course of the change in absorbance.
