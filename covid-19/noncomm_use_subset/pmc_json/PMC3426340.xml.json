Advances in food safety were largely due to the efforts of Rudolf Virchow (1821\u20131902), a German physician who established the field of veterinary pathology and public health meat inspection programs that transformed the role of veterinarians into vanguards of public health (8).",

The deadly E. coli 0104:H4 outbreak centered in northern Germany during May and June 2011 has devastated parts of the European agricultural industry, sickened thousands, and killed 32 people so far, highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration (9). The source of this outbreak, which likely involved the contamination of food with bacteria, remains uncertain, but it is likely (based on precedent) that domestic livestock were the source of fecal contamination. Logically, veterinarians who understand animal husbandry would be engaged in the investigation of this outbreak. However, manpower constraints and competing interests stand in the way. Currently, there are only 71 accredited (by AAVMC standards) schools of veterinary medicine (10), and the number of graduates pursuing careers in public health does not meet global needs.",
