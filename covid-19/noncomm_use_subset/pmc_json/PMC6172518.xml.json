The prevalence and mortality rate of pneumonia is particularly high in underdeveloped countries having poor healthcare resources and poor quality of sanitation. Understanding the incidence rate of pediatric pneumonia and identifying the pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) forms the basis for diagnosis, therapeutic treatment, and intervention. In a study of 154 children hospitalized for CAP in the United States, between January 1999 and March 2000, a period prior to the universal use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), Michelow et al. [2], identified a bacterial pathogen in 60% of cases of pneumonia. The Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria strain was identified in 73% of bacterial pathogen. S. pneumoniae was a common pathogen of CAP at that time [2]. The causal pathogen of CAP was very different in a survey of children under the age of 18 years who were hospitalized for pneumonia in designated hospitals in southern and Western part of US, between January 2010 and June 2012, a period after the universal use of PCV [1]. In this latter survey, a viral or bacterial cause was identified in 81% of cases, with more than one kind of virus detected in 66% of cases [1]. An exclusive bacterial cause was identified in only 8% of cases, with both bacterial and viral causes identified in 7% of cases. Therefore, by 2012, viruses had emerged as more significant pathogens of pneumonia than bacteria.",

S. pneumoniae was also reported as a major pathogen for pediatric empyema in a multicenter survey conducted in Korea between 1999 and 2004 [4].

Bacteria and viruses were the most typical pathogens, with M. pneumoniae being a common pathogen among preschool-aged children. The difficulty in identifying the causative pathogen due to difficulty in collecting specimen, such a sputum or mouth culture, for microbiological diagnosis, likely explains why an etiology was not specified in two-thirds of our cases. Among those with a clear etiology, viral pathogens were the most common, followed by M. pneumoniae and bacteria. In our case series from 2007 through 2014, the highest prevalence of viral pneumonia occurred in 2009 due to an outbreak of H1N1 influenza, although the prevalence of viral pneumonia did increase from 2007 through 2014 (Table 3). We speculate that the introduction of multiplex real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) improved the diagnosis of viral pathogens of pneumonia in Korea over the 8-year period of our study [11,12]. In fact, our data clearly indicate this, with an increase in the diagnosis of human metapneumovirus pneumonia using multiplex RT-PCR since 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR is a test for the addition of human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus to conventional respiratory virus detection (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus). In Korea, a study on respiratory virus using multiplex RT-PCR has been started in 2006 [13,14] and was gradually expanded [11,14]. Human metapneumovirus was a newly discovered virus, and it would take time for the ICD code to be created and used in Korea.",

The efficacy of the PCV7 for preventing invasive infections and acquiring herd immunity has been confirmed in several studies, including through monitoring by the US Centers for Disease Control [15,17]. The PCV has been associated with a >25% decrease in streptococcal pneumonia, as well as lowering the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and of pneumonia caused by antibiotics-resistant pneumococcal strain [15]. In Korea, the increasing trend in deep infection caused by one of the subtypes of S. pneumoniae in children under the age of 5 years from 1991 to 2003 was reversed in 2004 to 2006, presumably due to PCV immunization programs implemented in November 2003 [18]. Our data indicates the presence of a herd immunity among unvaccinated individuals, with a decrease in the prevalence of bacterial and pneumococcal pneumonia among children 7 to 18 years of age, although the PCV7 optional immunization program was only introduced in Korea in November 2003 [19].",

According to an epidemiological survey conducted by the Korea National Research Institute of Health, the incidence of mycoplasma infection increased in 2007, with a subsequent upsurge between 2010 and 2011 [9]. MP is associated with diverse radiological findings, including concomitant pleural effusion and lobar pneumonia, which makes its differential diagnosis from bacterial pneumonia difficult merely based on clinical presentations and chest radiographs [20,21]. Further, it is not uncommon for M. pneumoniae infection to coexist with infections from other pathogens [22]. Therefore, the prevalence and effects of a M. pneumoniae infection should be considered whenever the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia is evaluated. Over our 8-year study period, although not significant, though, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia decreased between 2007 and 2014, with the exception of a unique spike in 2011. The increase in the total number of patients with pneumonia, the number of patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of patients with pleural effusion and empyema in 2011 and the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia among children in the 4\u20136 and 7\u201312 years age groups in 2011 are speculated to have resulted from an nationwide MP epidemic extending from late 2010 to early 2012 (Fig. 2). The increased prevalence three years later (2013\u20132014) also likely resulted from a MP epidemic.",

Notably, the decreasing trend in the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia, and concomitant pleural effusion or empyema (Table 2), suggests that, similar to other countries, the introduction of PCV in Korea had a specific effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia and its complications.",

In May 2014, PCV10 and PCV13 were incorporated in the national immunization program in Korea [21]. With regard to the immunization rate achieved, about 40% of the candidates for vaccination are estimated to have received the PCV7 as of 2007 [15]. The 2011 national immunization rate survey of 3-year-old children (born in 2007) reported a PCV vaccination rate of 67.1% for the first dose, 60.5% for the second dose, 56.7% for the third dose, and 51.4% for the fourth dose, with a complete vaccination rate of 49.7% [24]. The 2013 national immunization rate survey of three-year-old children (born in 2009) showed an increased rate of PCV vaccination, with a vaccination rate of 83.4% for the first dose, 80.5% for the second dose, 77.8% for the third dose, and 70.4% for the fourth dose [25]. Although we could not evaluate immunization rate among the patients included in our analysis, we were able to confirm a vaccination rate of 50% among 3 years old in our 2007 cohort, which increased to about 70% for this age group in 2013. A limitation of our data set, which spans 2007\u20132014, is the difficulty in determining if the decline in pleural effusion and empyema could be explained by an increase rate of vaccination with the PCV7 or the introduction of the PCV10 and the PCV13 in 2010. The cyclical MP epidemic in Korea also influences the prevalence of pneumonia, making difficult to clearly distinguish the effects of PCV7 from those of the PCV10 or the PCV13.",

Overall, however, there is a paucity of data regarding changes in the incidence of pneumococcal infections in children in Korea after the introduction of the PCV10 and the PCV13, as well on the overall effects of these vaccines [26]. A detailed evaluation of the effects of pneumonia vaccines in Korea is challenging as it requires accurate specimen collection and identification of bacteria, as well as laboratories and researchers to support the entire research process. Nevertheless, our analysis of a relatively large cohort of children with pneumonia over an 8-year period does provide evidence of a declining prevalence of bacterial pneumonia, pleural effusion and empyema with the exception of a unique spike in prevalence in 2011. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the probable contribution of the PCV vaccination program in lowering the risk for pneumonia in children and adolescents.",
