Bacterial RTIs are less common and often develop after a viral infection. In children <5 years, 95% of the sore throat cases are caused by viruses; 85%\u201395% in adults. Only in the group of 5- to 15-year-old children, this percentage is reduced to 70%.2 Viruses associated with RTIs are picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses [HRV]), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human coronavirus [hCoV] OC43), ortho- and paramyxoviruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus), and adeno- and herpesviruses.3",

In 2005, Oxford et al5 published that lozenges containing AMC and DCBA showed some virucidal effect in vitro on three enveloped viruses, such as RSV, influenza A virus, and a member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV. However, they were not active against non-enveloped HRV2 and a not otherwise specified member of adenovirus group C. Recently, Shephard and Zybeshari6 showed some virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges on PIV3 and Cytomegalovirus or on PIV3 only, respectively. The mechanism of the virucidal action is not clear. However, the authors suggest a denaturation of external protein spikes, a pH-induced rearrangement of the tertiary structure of attachment proteins, or some selective effect on viral lipid membranes/protein\u2013lipid interaction to be responsible for the morphological changes and the virucidal action.5,6",

Currently a series of such lozenges with the same active ingredients but different flavors is available; additionally, lozenges were marketed, containing HR, as active agent. Shephard and Zybeshari6 tested the virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges. The experimental setup was the same in both publications. Lozenges were diluted in 5 or 4.5 mL artificial saliva or medium. Nine parts of the lozenges solution were then directly mixed with one part of the respective virus stock at a known titer. After different contact times, the residual infective virus was determined using quantitative titration. Oxford et al5 also checked for morphological changes using electron microscopy and found clumping of viruses and denaturation of spike proteins within 2 minutes of contact time. From these results it is concluded that lozenges containing either AMC/DCBA or HR might exhibit a local antiviral effect in patients with sore throat due to viral RTIs. However, the experimental setup does not allow the extrapolation of these data to a potential clinical effect. Dissolution of the lozenge in the mouth stimulates saliva production, resulting in a flow rate of 1.5\u20136 mL saliva/minute.14 As a consequence, 20\u201380 mL saliva were produced during the whole dissolution process of 13 minutes and 20 seconds. Therefore, the concentration of matrix and active ingredients at which the effect of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges was tested is 4\u201316 times higher than any achievable concentration in the mouth.",

The iota-carrageenan concentration of the assay reference is shown in the bottom right column. The agglutination control and all samples in the presence of virus (+) are tested in triplicates; agglutination control in the absence of the virus (\u2212) as singlet. Fully agglutinated wells indicate the absence of antiviral activity of the lozenges solution at this specific dilution.
