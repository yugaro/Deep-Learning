A RV outbreak was defined as two nosocomial cases (non-roommates) in a designated unit with symptom onset within 48 hours and a lab-confirmed respiratory virus detected in a least one case. In the absence of laboratory confirmation of a respiratory virus, three nosocomial cases (non-roommates) within 48 hours in one unit was considered a RV outbreak.7 RV outbreaks were declared over on day 8 following the onset of the last nosocomial RV case, in accordance with local public health guidelines.7",

This review identified that outbreaks resulted from a delay in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (6/12, 50%), staff working while ill (2/12, 17%), shared accommodations (2/12, 17%) and no definite cause identified but sick visitor suspected (2/12, 17%).",

Table 1 summarises the four new processes developed and their relationship to the problems identified. First, clarity was achieved regarding the criteria for initiation of droplet and contact precautions to include any patient with any of the following symptoms: new or worsening cough, runny nose, congestion or sore throat (September 2017). Second, communication to visitors to please not visit if they have any of those symptoms was included in two forms: an automated telephone message heard on calling the rehabilitation centre and signs placed in the lobby entrance (November 2017). Third, communication to staff regarding exemption for illness due to infectious causes was communicated to all healthcare providers in an attempt to address the perceived barrier of not coming to work ill (October 2017). To mitigate the risk of abuse of this exemption policy, improved reporting to OHS was required, which in turn necessitated a more efficient process for reporting to OHS. The fourth intervention was the development of an electronic programme allowing staff to report illness to OHS and simultaneously receive guidance about whether they are excluded from work due to infectious illness (December 2017). This programme incorporated questions about specific symptoms and symptom-onset and provided a personalised recommendation about whether the healthcare provider should work or remain home, based on whether or not they were considered infectious (see online supplementary material). In the event that the system identified a staff person as being infectious, the recommendation could be forwarded to the manager of the unit in order to exempt the employee from the attendance management system.",

In the paediatric population, nosocomial transmission has been shown to be prevented through screening of patients and cohorting nurses with positive children along with the use of transmission-based precautions.5 In a population of stem cell transplant patients, universal use of surgical masks by healthcare providers was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in nosocomial RV infection.8",

Our approach was to better understand the barriers to adherence to IPAC practices within the rehabilitation context. We used epidemiological data to identify important triggers of outbreaks and then drilled down to understand the main drivers. For example, delays in testing and initiation of droplet and contact precautions were occurring due to lack of clarity around syndromic criteria which was addressed through systematic training. Lack of private rooms was an additional barrier noted by our staff, but our experience showed that earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions actually led to the same number of isolation-days presumably due to reduced nosocomial transmission. Finally, we uncovered a number of system problems that made it easier for staff to work while sick rather than staying home. These included the perceived pressure from human resources attendance management and the challenge in accessing OHS. Once these were addressed through redevelopment of an OHS electronic software reporting programme, better reporting of illness was seen. These examples underscore the impact of process changes that are linked to the specific barriers to best practice rather than relying on education alone.9",

One explanation for this finding is that the additional absences for staff staying home when potentially infectious was offset by a reduction in staff becoming infected while at work due to fewer encounters with infectious colleagues and fewer unprotected encounters with nosocomial RV cases. These data argue against the perception that staff staying home when symptomatic could increase staff shortages and should empower organisations to create similar models of care that make staying home when sick the easier thing to do.10",

One potential explanation is that increased viral testing resulted in ascertainment of more nosocomial cases even though there was reduced transmission through earlier use of droplet and contact precautions. Another possibility is that our intervention could not fully prevent nosocomial transmission as visitors continued to enter with infectious symptoms since we could not monitor this practice accurately. Finally, even though we reduced symptomatic visitation, either healthcare providers or visitors could have continued to transmit RV through asymptomatic viral carriage.11 Some studies found limiting visits by children under the age of 12 during the winter months, may reduce nosocomial transmission of viral respiratory infection.12 However, this approach may be a challenging and costly to operationalise as active screeners have to be strategically posted throughout the season.",
