Hospital transmission of MERS-CoV has been attributed to suboptimal infection control practices such as lack of personal protective equipment use, poor hand hygiene, delay in timely index case isolation, lack of negative pressure rooms, and performing aerosolizing procedures without appropriate personal protective equipment. Thus, there is an urgent need to reinforce the execution of basic IPC measures at all times in all healthcare facilities. Other pivotal interventions in reducing nosocomial transmission include prompt triaging, staff cohorting, and excluding non-essential staff and visitors.6,15",
