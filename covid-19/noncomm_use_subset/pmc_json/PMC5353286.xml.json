            "text": "However, the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza transmission remains challenging. Reactive school closure during an influenza pandemic was often accompanied by other control measures such as intensive screening, border control measures and improved sanitation, which may confound the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza incidence. To differentiate the effects of school closure from other accompanied interventions and changed health-seeking behaviour, some studies have evaluated the effects of school closure on influenza transmission by focusing on school breaks rather than reactive school closures. As school calendars are usually set at the beginning of each school term, observed changes of influenza incidence before, during and after school breaks are believed to be less confounded than school closures aimed to control a pandemic.9\n10 Significant associations between winter school breaks and temporary reductions of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence have been found in Chile10 and Argentina,9 as children were less likely to be gathered during school breaks thus reducing the chance of influenza transmission. We hypothesised that the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks in China might also be relevant to ILI incidence reductions among schoolchildren and adults. Our study aims to assess the effects of winter/summer school breaks on ILI incidence by estimating the ILI incidence ratio of schoolchildren to adults before, during and after the breaks in Xicheng District, Beijing, China.",

Weekly district-wide ILI time series during 2008\u20132015 was obtained from Beijing Medical Institutions in Communicable Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System. ILI was defined as fever (temperature of 38\u00b0C or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. The ILI reporting system recorded weekly ILI cases into five age groups (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201359 and 60 years or older). Beijing Children's Hospital, affiliated with Capital Medical University is one of the sentinel hospitals for ILI surveillance, and accounts for more than half of the total paediatric outpatient visits in Beijing. To render our data more representative of ILI rates across the entire Beijing population, we age-standardised our ILI visit data in Xicheng District to the age distribution of Beijing's population. Age-specific population sizes in Xicheng District were collected from China's 2010 population census. We assumed that the age-stratified population remained constant over the study period. We ignored the immunised population as the influenza vaccination coverage was below 3% in the general population.",

A vector of dummy variables for each year was considered and sinusoidal terms of weeks were added in the Poisson model to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, respectively. As weekly adjacent ILI visits were temporally correlated, we further added an autocorrelated regression term to adjust for autocorrelation in the Poisson model.13 Details of the model can be found in online supplementary appendix and tables S1-S2. Model fitting was evaluated by pseudo R2 values. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks were used to evaluate the change of ILI incidence before, during and after winter breaks in each age group. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks smaller than 1 indicated that ILI visits during/after winter breaks were lower than those before winter breaks. We presented the estimates as weekly IRRs, which was calculated by dividing the weekly ILI incidence during/after winter breaks to an average of ILI incidence 2 weeks before winter breaks.

The models generally well fitted the observed ILIs with adjusted pseudo R2 values for the five age groups (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201359 and 60 years or older) ranging from 0.44 to 0.56. After incorporating the autocorrelation within error terms, we estimated IRRs of during/after to before winter break and their CIs (table 2). During-to-before IRRs were smaller than 1 for all age groups. However, the starting time and duration of the ILI reduction varied across different age groups. In age group of 15\u201324, ILI incidence dropped substantially by around 40% during the whole school break and lasted for 4 weeks thereafter. Declines of during-to-before IRRs for age groups of 0\u20134 and 5\u201314 were also observable but not necessarily smaller than declines in adults (table 2). For adults (age 25\u201359 and 60 years or older), ILI reductions were statistically significant in the second and third week of the break and lasted for about 2 weeks (table 2). Among all age groups, incidence of ILI visits returned to regular patterns with none of after\u2013before IRRs statistically significant 3 weeks after the end of winter breaks (table 2).",

For age groups of 0\u20134 and 5\u201314, peaks of ILI% had also been detected before summer breaks, which might be driven by final examination stress, poor classroom ventilation, incompletely developed immune system and other unfavourable factors related to young children. Since ILI visits could be caused by influenza, respiratory tract infection and other illness, ILI% is a broad indicator of respiratory disease activity not entirely specific for influenza and could be affected by changes in health-seeking behaviour.10 Therefore, laboratory surveillance data are necessary for further conclusions on age-specific seasonal influenza activities from a public health perspective.",

In consistency with previous empirical studies in Chile, USA and European countries,10\n17 the average reduction in schoolchildren-to-adult IRRs in Beijing lasted for up to 2 weeks (table 1) after school sessions resumed, and this allowed a few successive chains of transmission for influenza virus to reach full-scale transmission.10 The finding that ILI incidence rates decreased substantially in schoolchildren yet modestly in adults during winter breaks is consistent with past work on age-specific influenza transmission.17 Moreover, the reduction in ILI during the school holidays went beyond the dips in ILI \u00b14 weeks surrounding the holiday weeks (see online supplementary appendix), further supporting our suggestion of lower influenza transmission in schoolchildren during school breaks.",

In addition to different strains of influenza circulating in a certain year, there could be many other human behaviour factors playing a role in regulating seasonal age-specific ILI visits in China. For example, under pressure of final examinations before winter breaks, some schoolchildren are unwilling to spare any time to see a doctor when they had influenza-like symptoms. During Chinese Spring Festival vacation (covered by winter breaks), most of migrant workers in Beijing went back to their hometown18\n19 and local people who stayed in the city were unwilling to seek medical advice for fear of missing family gatherings (see online supplementary figure S1). Moreover, apparent drops of total outpatient visits were observed in every January (see online supplementary figure S1), suggesting the change of healthcare-seeking behaviour around the holidays. In fact, IRRs of schoolchildren aged 5\u201314 to adults during Spring Festival were significantly higher than other weeks within winter breaks.20\n21 Consequently, we infer the enhanced IRRs of schoolchildren aged 5\u201314 to adults in winter breaks are due to integrated effects of Spring Festival, population migration and changes in health-seeking behaviour.",

We found a significant reduction in ILI incidence rates for age group of 5\u201314 when entering winter breaks, compared with those of 2 weeks before (IRR 0.89, 95% CI (0.81 to 0.98)). However, the reduction is less significant when comparing with the rates throughout the entire break for the adults' groups. The phenomenon that reduction of ILI incidence rates for age above 60 was larger than those for age 25\u201359 and close to those for age 15\u201324 (table 2) could be due to age-specific health-seeking behaviour, immune system characteristics and residual confounders of seasonal ILI visits. Although a Serfling model has been adopted, our model is still relatively conservative in controlling seasonal pattern of ILI because timing of peaks of influenza activities had severe overlaps with timing of winter breaks, and the overfitting could underestimate the effect of winter breaks on decrease of IRRs. Therefore, additional analysis that considers high variability in the temporal relationship between winter breaks and weekly ILI rates across influenza seasons are needed and incorporating environmental factors or human behaviour data may better clarify the relationship between age-specific influenza activity and winter breaks.",
