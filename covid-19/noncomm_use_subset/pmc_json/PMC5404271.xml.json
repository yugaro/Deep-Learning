During the next 10 months, Taiwan CDC established a GHSA External Assessment Working Group in the Division of Planning and Coordination and an agency-level, interdepartmental GHSA External Assessment Task Force; secured funding and high-level support from the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW); and requested expertise and guidance from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Center for Health Security (now the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security) to prepare for the assessment. In February 2016, in light of the fresh release of the JEE tool, which already integrated the GHSA assessment tool, Taiwan CDC and the Center for Health Security promptly decided to switch to the JEE tool for this assessment.12 Although the JEE Working Group (formerly named the GHSA External Assessment Working Group) remained in the division of planning and coordination of Taiwan CDC, because the JEE was used to assess Taiwan's collected capabilities, not just those of the MoHW or Taiwan CDC, the interdepartmental task force was expanded to a multisectoral team that involved other government agencies, such as authorities of agriculture, defense, border control, environmental protection, and nuclear power, to address elements that were not included in the GHSA assessment tool.",

Before the discussion, individual members were instructed that, because the experts would talk them through each indicator and question to ensure full understanding, it was unnecessary for the members to answer or draft a response to the JEE questions in advance. The discussion of each element generally took at least 30 minutes, mostly involving clarification about what each question really means and how responses should be drafted. For example, elaborative answers that demonstrated real examples were preferred, rather than just yes or no answers. The members could also describe an example that came to mind and ask the experts if it was eligible for a response. Although most of the time the experts' answers would be \u201cyes,\u201d the Q&A process not only provided reassurance to the members who were not native English speakers but also helped engage the members in ownership of JEE implementation.

Throughout the process, the JEE working group facilitated communication and coordination among all departments, forwarded additional queries that were raised by the multisectoral team members to the Center for Health Security for clarification, provided support with English translation if necessary, and compiled the self-assessment report. Four high-ranking Taiwan CDC officials, each responsible for 4 to 5 JEE elements, were asked to review the reports with the team members who drafted the responses to ensure appropriateness of the content and representativeness of the report at the national level.
