In contrast, B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212 mice that were extensively backcrossed onto the B6 genetic background (CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6]) underwent AICD after BCR ligation. CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells also expressed CD5 after BCR stimulation but failed to up-regulate c-Myc transcript expression, whereas B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] had normal CD5 and c-Myc expression (Fig. 1, C and D). Similarly, B cells from IgTgsHEL mice with a B6 background underwent AICD, expressed CD5, and failed to up-regulate c-Myc after ex vivo BCR stimulation (Fig. 1, E\u2013G). In contrast, B cells from IgTg mice (lacking the sHEL auto-Ag) blasted robustly, expressed CD5 at normal levels, and expressed high c-Myc levels after BCR ligation. These striking phenotypic similarities between CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] and IgTgsHEL mice suggested that shared genetic and signaling programs regulated B cell AICD.",

To identify the genetic basis for the CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cell phenotype, CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] and CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] mice were first crossed to produce an F1 generation (CD22\u2212/\u2212[F1], Fig. 2 A) with either homozygous B6 (B6:B6) or heterozygous B6 and 129 (B6:129) genetic loci. CD22\u2212/\u2212[F1] B cell blast development after BCR stimulation was intermediate between B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] and CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] mice (unpublished data), indicating that maximal AICD of CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells required B6:B6 homozygosity at a critical locus (or loci). CD22\u2212/\u2212[F1] and CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] mice were subsequently crossed to generate genetically distinct CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] littermates due to independent chromosomal segregation and crossovers between regions of heterozygous B6:129 genomic DNA during gametogenesis. Remarkably, B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice underwent AICD (Fig. 2 B, top dot plots) or developed into blasts at substantial levels (Fig. 2 B, bottom dot plots), which correlated directly with increased or normal CD5 expression, respectively. These results confirmed the existence of a genetic modifier locus/loci that regulates BCR-induced AICD and CD5 expression.",

Therefore, a forward genetic linkage analysis was used to identify the gene locus/loci responsible for CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cell AICD. Genome-wide genotyping of 250 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the B6 and 129 mouse strains used genomic DNA from 44 CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice; 22 mice had viable B cells after BCR ligation, whereas 22 mice had B cells that underwent AICD (Fig. 2 C). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping regression analysis revealed a single locus with high logarithm of odds (LOD) scores (P < 10\u22126) on the distal end of chromosome (Chr) 15 (Fig. 2 D), with four consecutive SNPs spanning the region from 68\u201391 megabase pairs (Mbp, Fig. 2 E). LOD scores from the first three SNPs (68, 71, and 78 Mbp) were 8.3, increasing to 12.6 for the distal SNP (91 Mbp). The increased LOD score at 91 Mbp resulted from two mice (#14 and 28) with additional crossovers that were concordant with the observed phenotype. Parental CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] mice were homozygous B6:B6 within the identified locus (68\u201391 Mbp), whereas CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] mice were homozygous 129:129. All other SNPs on Chr 15 outside of this locus (3.8\u201353 and 102 Mbp) were homozygous B6:B6 in all mice. Therefore, the primary genetic element responsible for CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cell AICD was located within a 24 Mbp region.",

Mice having apparently discordant phenotypes under low resolution mapping (viable, #2 and 19; nonviable, #44, Fig. 2 E) had concordant genotypes with higher resolution analysis (Fig. 2 F). To further refine and validate this locus as harboring the genetic element controlling AICD, additional SNPs and a total of 103 CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice were analyzed (Fig. 2 G). Genotype and observed phenotypes were 98% (101/103) concordant in the mice, with additional crossovers observed in CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice #21 and 64.

            "text": "EndoU function in mammals is unknown, although EndoU transcripts are abundant in glucocorticoid-sensitive thymocytes undergoing apoptosis (Baughman et al., 1992). Highly conserved EndoU orthologs are found in many advanced and primitive species (see Fig. 8 A; Renzi et al., 2006), but EndoU paralogs derived from ancestral gene duplications do not exist in mice. The Xenopus ortholog of EndoU, XendoU, has been defined as an endonuclease targeting ssRNA molecules harboring polyuridine (poly(U)) regions (Renzi et al., 2006). Because EndoU substrates have not been defined in other species and EndoU-related molecules that could share redundant activities are not found in mice, the ability of EndoU to bind and/or process XendoU ssRNA substrates was examined. Recombinant EndoU protein specifically bound poly(U) ssRNAs, but not ssRNA species lacking these sites (Fig. 3 E). However, EndoU did not cleave these poly(U) ssRNAs, even in the presence of Mn2+, a condition favorable for XendoU endonuclease activity (Laneve et al., 2003). Mn2+ chelation did not interfere with EndoU binding of ssRNA molecules, as described for XendoU (Gioia et al., 2005). Thus, EndoU binds ssRNAs, likely through its predicted XendoU Superfamily domain (see Fig. 8 A).",

Like the XendoU ssRNA substrate, c-Myc mRNA was also bound by recombinant EndoU (Fig. 3 F), but mRNA cleavage was not detectable (not depicted). Thus, c-Myc mRNA is a potential EndoU substrate, which may explain reduced c-Myc expression when B cells overexpress EndoU. Further supporting this notion, ectopic EndoU expression in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts significantly reduced c-Myc protein levels (Fig. 3 G; 32% decrease, P < 0.05).",

EndoU-deficient mice were generated by appropriately targeting the EndoU gene on B6 Chr 15 (Fig. 4, A\u2013C). PCR-based SNP genotyping of genomic DNA from targeted mice confirmed that the targeted EndoU locus was B6 in origin. The chimeric mice were then bred onto a B6 genetic background to generate EndoU\u2212/\u2212[B6] mice that were homozygous B6:B6 throughout the 93.3\u201398.3 Mbp Chr 15 region (unpublished data). The absence of EndoU protein in homozygous gene-targeted mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which identified an appropriately sized protein in WT mice (Fig. 4 D). EndoU from CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells and thymocytes migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE gels (\u223c50 kD band) than EndoU from CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] thymocytes (\u223c48 kD band, Figs. 3 C and 4 E), due to a nonsynonymous SNP present within EndoU exon 2 which switches a single Glu (B6 mice) to Lys (129 mice). This was verified using A/J mice that share the EndoU SNP sequence with 129 mice, with EndoU from both CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] and A/J mice migrating identically (Fig. 4 F). Splenocytes from CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] and CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] mice expressed a single EndoU cDNA species as confirmed using 5\u2032 RACE procedures (unpublished data).

In WT[B6] mice, EndoU transcription and protein expression were suppressed by the balance between tonic BCR signals and their modulation by CD22, permitting normal BCR-mediated responses without blatant AICD after BCR ligation. In contrast, heightened BCR signals in peripheral B cells of CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] mice drove EndoU overexpression and the CD5highHSAhigh phenotype with predominant AICD after BCR ligation. Genetic deletion of EndoU expression reversed the CD5highHSAhigh phenotype of B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] mice and normalized AICD, confirming its important regulatory function in these processes. Bona fide EndoU substrates are likely to include c-Myc and other regulatory transcripts in vivo because c-Myc up-regulation is uniquely impaired in CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells (Poe et al., 2004), c-Myc expression was normalized in CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells by EndoU deficiency, EndoU bound c-Myc mRNA in vitro, and ectopic EndoU expression in a fibroblast cell line reduced c-Myc levels. A regulatory role for c-Myc in the mouse WEHI-231 B cell model of AICD has been previously described (Sonenshein, 1997; Donjerkovi\u0107 and Scott, 2000). In CD22\u2212/\u2212 mice, EndoU overexpression and AICD required B6 homozygosity at the EndoU locus. Therefore, genetic alterations must exist within the EndoU locus between the B6 and 129 genetic backgrounds that positively influences EndoU[B6] allele transcription in B cells, but not T cells. Although the EndoU locus has yet to be fine-mapped or sequenced in 129 mice, these important regulatory elements are likely to be located within the numerous stretches of conserved noncoding DNA present within the EndoU 5\u2032 promoter region and 3\u2032-UTR between B6 mice and humans (Fig. 8 C).",

In contrast, chronically high EndoU expression by CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells prevents c-Myc up-regulation after BCR ligation, resulting in AICD.

Genetic deletion of EndoU normalized this B cell phenotype in a substantial number of IgTgsHEL mice, which correlated with robust anti-HEL auto-Ab responses at an early age in mice that were defined as high responders.

Given the linkage between EndoU, c-Myc up-regulation and AICD, it is likely that decreased B cell AICD in EndoU\u2212/\u2212IgTgsHEL mice leads to increased numbers of B cells that eventually consume endogenous sHEL auto-Ag, permitting clonal expansion with a resultant increase in anti-HEL auto-Ab production.",

For example, IgTgsHEL mice deficient in the inositol phosphatase PTEN have reduced BCR occupancy by sHEL and produce anti-HEL auto-Abs at a higher level than IgTgsHEL mice. This results in a subsequent break in tolerance in some mice caused by depletion of available sHEL auto-Ag (Browne et al., 2009). Likewise, IgTgsHEL mice transgenic for CD19 overexpression progressively break tolerance as they age and eventually produce high anti-HEL auto-Ab levels (Inaoki et al., 1997). In fact, remarkably similar to EndoU\u2212/\u2212IgTgsHEL mice, CD19TgIgTgsHEL mice develop as both high- and augmented-responder mice by 2 mo of age. Thus, modest increases in B cell numbers or enhancement in auto-Ab production resulting from altered B cell signaling can lead to auto-Ag depletion. Once this initial reduction in sHEL levels occurs, the resulting lack of B cell anergy enables peripheral B cell numbers to be maintained at a level that exceeds sHEL production, resulting in sustained and high-level anti-HEL auto-Ab production. Thereby, the EndoU regulatory pathway is likely to be an important component of B cell tolerance regulation, which is consistent with the known polygenic origins of autoimmunity.",

EndoU transcripts expressed in mouse B cells encoded a protein of 454 amino acids, which includes an N-terminal somatomedin B-like domain believed to be involved in protein\u2013protein interactions (Gijsbers et al., 2003), a XendoU Superfamily ssRNA-binding domain, and a predicted transmembrane domain. EndoU specifically interacted with an ssRNA substrate harboring U-rich sequences that is also bound by XendoU, which is implicated in small nucleolar RNA processing in Xenopus (Gioia et al., 2005; Renzi et al., 2006). XendoU apparently generates snoRNAs through the cleavage of pre-mRNAs encoded within introns (Laneve et al., 2003). Human EndoU may exhibit low-level U-directed ssRNA endoribonuclease activity against the same in vitro ssRNA substrates recognized by XendoU (Laneve et al., 2008). However, mouse EndoU did not demonstrate measurable endonuclease activity against XendoU substrates. Mammalian EndoU may thus be functionally distinct from its Xenopus ortholog because human EndoU is excluded from the nucleolus of multiple cell lines (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405/subcellular).",

Although Nsp15 is required for viral replication, specific Nsp15 substrates have not been identified and, surprisingly, appear to exclude the viral genome itself (Ivanov et al., 2004). Nsp15 has been postulated to suppress host immune responses (Ricagno et al., 2006) and to facilitate apoptosis in cells expressing the MAVS (mitochondrial anti-viral signaling) adapter protein that induces host anti-viral responses (Lei et al., 2009). Mouse hepatitis virus is also a member of the nidovirus family, is lymphotropic, and induces immunosuppression at least in part through the elimination of developing B cells (Lamontagne et al., 1989; Jolicoeur and Lamontagne, 1994). It therefore remains possible that mouse EndoU and hepatitis virus Nsp15 may target similar ssRNA substrates in B cells despite their evolutionary divergence.

Furthermore, these studies suggest an EndoU, CD22, c-Myc, and CD19 regulatory loop that directs normal B cell survival and malignant transformation (Fujimoto et al., 1999; Poe et al., 2012). EndoU likely regulates c-Myc and potentially other crucial ssRNA (mRNA or pre-mRNA) transcripts and nonclassical ssRNAs that directly regulate or fine-tune specific subsets of genes required for optimal B cell proliferation and survival. For autoreactive B cells that survive central selection and inhabit peripheral tissues, EndoU overexpression has nonetheless evolved as a checkpoint protein within the complex pathway that keeps potentially pathogenic B cells at bay through deletion via AICD.",

B cells from some CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice were anergic (were CD5high and underwent AICD [7AAD+FSClow] after BCR stimulation; top), whereas others had a normal phenotype (were CD5low and developed into blasts [7AAD\u2212FSChigh], bottom). Results are representative of those obtained from >40 CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] littermates assessed in 10 independent experiments. (C) Survival analysis of BCR-stimulated B cells from CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] littermates used for genomic SNP genotyping. Results are pooled from 10 independent CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mouse B cell blast assays (open squares), as described in B. Each value represents a single mouse, with dashed boxes distinguishing between CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] littermates having B cells sufficient in blast development (top box), or insufficient in blast development (bottom box). Shown for comparison are the parental mouse B cells assessed in each of the assays as controls: CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] B cells (apoptotic, black diamonds) and CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] B cells (viable, gray circles).

The Cd22 gene location (Chr 7) is indicated. (E) Detailed heat map display of the Chr 15 mapping data shown in D. The locus of significance was defined by four consecutive SNPs positioned at 68, 71, 78, and 91 Mbp with LOD scores of 8.3\u201312.6. Columns represent individual CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice, with blue squares indicating homozygous B6:B6 SNP loci and red squares indicating heterozygous B6:129 SNP loci. Representative genotypes of parental CD22\u2212/\u2212[B6] and CD22\u2212/\u2212[inbr] mice are shown at the right, with green squares indicating regions of 129 homozygosity. (F) Refined PCR-based SNP mapping of the Chr 15 locus of CD22\u2212/\u2212[N1] mice at 1 Mbp intervals from 78 to 102 Mbp. Open squares represent SNPs that were not assessed.

A targeting vector was generated that contained a neomycin-resistance gene (neor) introduced into two unique BsmBI restriction sites, which introduced an in-frame termination codon. A thymidine kinase gene (tk) was inserted at the 5\u2032 end of the EndoU gene sequence. (B) Homologous recombination of the targeting vector into the EndoU gene of heterozygous and homozygous offspring expanded the endogenous 7.5 kb HindIII digested genomic DNA fragment into an 8.5 kb fragment as assessed by Southern blot. (C) Appropriate targeting of the EndoU gene was further confirmed by PCR analysis (primer locations shown in A), whereby a common forward primer (PCR1) was used in combination with reverse primers either adjacent to (PCR2) or within (PCR3) the neor gene. Results show amplification of genomic DNA from WT, heterozygous, and homozygous offspring.
