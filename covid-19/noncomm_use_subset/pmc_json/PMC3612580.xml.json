However, no comorbidity\nscore is perfect and residual confounding cannot be completely excluded in this\nobservational dataset. Data on time from symptom onset to hospital admission were\navailable in 1,083 (71.3%) patients. There was no systematic reason\nfor missing data and patients with missing data were similar to other patients.\nTherefore, given the overall size of the FLU-CIN cohort and the strength of the\nassociations examined, it is unlikely that the missing data resulted in\nsignificantly altered results. Pandemic influenza vaccination status was not\nreliably recorded in the medical notes for all patients in the FLU-CIN cohort.\nAsthmatics, being in the target group for vaccination in the UK, may have been more\nlikely to have been vaccinated compared with nonasthmatics. As all patients in this\nstudy had laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection, if any patient had received the\npandemic influenza vaccination, it had not prevented occurrence of infection. The\npossibility that vaccination of asthmatics may have attenuated the severity of\nillness remains. However, patients with other comorbid illnesses (who would\nhave been equally likely to receive early vaccination) were not observed to\nhave fewer severe outcomes, as had asthmatics. Therefore, a protective effect from\npandemic influenza vaccination is unlikely to explain the findings of the current\nstudy.",

Likewise, low\nadherence rates to asthma medication, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, are\nassociated with poorer asthma outcomes [20,\n21].

            "text": "The relationship between asthma, in-hospital systemic corticosteroid use and clinical\noutcomes is more complicated. Some cohort studies of critically ill patients with\nH1N1pdm infection have reported an association of systemic corticosteroids with\nhigher mortality or higher rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia [22\u201324], while other studies have not identified any association between\nsystemic corticosteroid use and severe outcomes [25]. None of these studies differentiated between asthmatics and\nnonasthmatics. In the current study, systemic corticosteroids were associated with a\nlower likelihood of severe outcomes in asthmatics, while in nonasthmatics, there was\nan association with an increased likelihood of severe outcomes. This reflects the\nsubstantially different indications for administration of systemic corticosteroids\nin asthmatics compared with nonasthmatics. The benefit of systemic corticosteroids\nin the acute management of exacerbations of asthma is well described and rests on a\nlarge evidence base [26]. The findings from\nthis study support the principles of acute asthma management, including the use of\nsystemic corticosteroids for asthmatics hospitalised with influenza infection. In\ncontradistinction, for nonasthmatics, the role of systemic corticosteroids in the\nmanagement of severe influenza infections remains unclear and may even be harmful\n[27, 28]. In this study, corticosteroid use in nonasthmatics may have been\nmore frequent in severely ill cases and, therefore, its use may merely be a marker\nfor severe disease. However, this explanation alone does not account for the finding\nby Han\net al. [24] that patients\nwith H1N1pdm infection who were treated prospectively with corticosteroids as a\nfever suppressant suffered worse outcomes. An adequately powered randomised\ncontrolled trial is required to inform the current debate, taking into account the\npossibility that different clinical groups may have different types of disease and\nmay either benefit from or be harmed by steroid therapy.",
