In addition, the prevalences of comorbidities and mortality have been reported to be higher than 40-50% in ARF patients, especially in those with diffuse infiltrates as seen on chest X-rays.1-3 The clinical and radiological findings in ARF are nonspecific,4-6 and prompt investigation and diagnosis are essential to improving patient survival.7-9 In this context, the complexity of clinical presentations makes diagnosis a constant challenge for the clinician. Despite recent advances, most types of diagnostic support are still expensive. Clinicians often initiate treatment to avoid the rapid progression of the disease and to spare the patient from more invasive procedures. Therefore, it is important to determine the leading causes of death in this population to establish correct prophylactic actions, which is the least expensive strategy for preventing further pulmonary dysfunction and avoiding the need for lung biopsies.10",

In this study, we reviewed all of the available microscopic and macroscopic diagnoses of death at autopsy, along with the patient medical records. The only inclusion criterion for the definition of ARF was based on arterial blood gases (PaO2<60 mmHg or PaCO2>50 mmHg with pH<7.30) while breathing room air.1-3 We excluded patients younger than one year of age and individuals not diagnosed with ARF.",

The paraffin-embedded tissue sections were assessed following hematoxylin and eosin staining. To document the presence and distribution of the wide spectrum of infectious agents and neoplasms to which this population was susceptible, we prepared a variety of special stains (periodic acid-Schiff staining, immunohistochemical analysis, fluorescence, Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining, Gram acid-fast staining, Mucicarmine acid-fast staining, and Gomori's methenamine silver acid-fast staining) for selected tissue sections. Bacterial bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as the presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in bronchioles and adjacent alveoli. For the diagnoses of cytomegalovirus and fungal pneumonia, histological evidence of lung involvement was required, with or without tissue culture. Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined as sepsis with the addition of organ dysfunction or the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypotension, which may or may not have been responsible for the aggressive fluid resuscitation. The diagnoses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and atypical mycobacterial infection were confirmed using fluorescence, the Ziehl-Neelsen techniques and a Lowenstein-Jensen culture.
