Additionally, the antibody and CMI memory\nresponses induced by this vaccination protocol are relevantly associated with the protection\nstatus of chickens vaccinated and challenged with a nephropathogenic IBV strain,\nhighlighting the importance of these immune responses to confer protection against this\npathotype of IBV and stressing the potential of combining heterologous live attenuated\nvaccines with homologous inactivated vaccines for efficiently controlling infection caused\nby nephropathogenic variant IBV strains, such as those of BR-I genotype.",
