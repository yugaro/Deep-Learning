At present, no vaccine or specific treatment is available, although serious attempts to develop preventive therapy are ongoing.32 According to the World Bank, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak resulted in an estimated global economic cost of $16 billion,5 and it is believed that the MERS-CoV infection toll on the overall global economy, and particularly the Saudi economy, will also be enormous. The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea resulted in an estimated economic loss of $10 billion in the tourism sector alone.33 Although among countries affected by MERS Saudi Arabia was impacted the most, no effort was made to estimate the immense impact of this epidemic on either the macro- or microeconomic levels. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with the management of MERS-CoV cases at one of the tertiary referral hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",

One-third of the patients included in the analysis were health care workers. The presence of such a high percentage of health professionals among MERS patients raises serious questions regarding the effectiveness and/or enforcement of infection control policies in hospitals. Moreover, it exposes the lack of response among decision makers to past calls for improvement,25,26 providing a grim outlook for the future. The inadequate prevention of nosocomial infections is further underlined by the fact that four of the 24 MERS cases (16.67%) were admitted for symptoms that were not related to MERS infection, and the disease was identified three to 6 days later, suggesting that those patients caught the infection during their hospitalization, which questions again the effectiveness of the hospital infection control policy. Additionally, the unavailability of the data for 20 out of 44 MERS cases unveils poor documentation practices and lack of mandatory management protocols (Figure 1).",

The high prevalence of MERS-CoV infections caused by human-to-human contact calls into question the effectiveness of infection control policies at the national level and reveals the inadequacy of the preventive measures taken by the Saudi Ministry of Health that persists after more than 3 years of the MERS-CoV outbreak.25 In fact, the current analysis identified 13 cases (54%) that were discharged within one day of their MERS diagnosis mainly due to the lack of available treatment and the fear of nosocomial transmission. However, the decision to discharge those patients could increase the risk of MERS-CoV transmission outside the hospital, particularly to those at higher risk, such as immunocompromised patients with diabetes and other health conditions prevalent in Saudi Arabia.34 This is concerning given that approximately 46% of the cases were exposed to a MERS case within the past 2 weeks prior to their admission. To control the transmission of MERS-CoV, patients diagnosed with MERS should have been quarantined, an intervention that was successfully implemented in South Korea to contain MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015.27,35 The failure to isolate sick patients contributes significantly to the perpetual problem in containing this epidemic that the Saudi health system is still grappling with. Lastly, as a part of the present investigation, a significant effort has been made to review more cases from multiple referral centers. However, these attempts went in vain. The lack of transparency in the management of MERS-CoV infections by some health care facilities in Saudi Arabia is alarming. Notably, the mismanagement of MERS epidemic in Saudi Arabia was highlighted in the press.36",
