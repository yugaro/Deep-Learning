Pathogens that infect multiple host species are more likely to emerge in human populations than host-restricted pathogens (Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse 2001). It is therefore important to understand the genetic diversity of viruses circulating in both human and animal populations and to identify possible cross-species transmissions.",

            "text": "Aichi Virus A-1 (hereafter \u2018AiV-A1\u2019) is one of several recently discovered enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans which belongs to the Kobuvirus genus (Yamashita et al. 1991). Kobuviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome 6.9\u20138.4 kb in length. The genome structure is composed of a leader protein (L), followed by structural capsid proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1) and non-structural proteins (2 A\u20132 C and 3 A\u20133 D) (Yamashita et al. 1998, 2003; Ng et al. 2012). To date, kobuviruses have been found in multiple host taxa including humans, lagomorpha (rabbits), chiroptera (bats), rodentia, artiodactyla, carnivora, and aves, as well as in environmental samples (Yamashita et al. 2003; Reuter et al. 2008, 2010; Kapoor et al. 2011a; Wu et al. 2012; Lodder et al. 2013; Smits et al. 2013; Oem et al. 2014; Pankovics et al. 2015, 2016). Kobuviruses are currently grouped into six different species (AiV A to F) and unassigned kobuviruses according to the latest report of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/). However, it is still unclear whether the broad host range of kobuviruses is indicative of cross-species transmission events. Additionally, there may be novel and unknown kobuviruses present in other host species; their existence may increase the scope for further transmission events between animals and humans.",

Approximately half of the Vietnamese population participate in small-scale animal production (GSO 2013; Rabaa et al. 2015). Many smallholdings have minimum biosecurity and house several different animal species within a small area. Housing different animal species within a single enclosure creates an environment where interspecies transmission of pathogens may be more likely. In addition, eating wild animals that have been hunted and commercial wildlife farming (such as bamboo rats, civets, porcupines, wild boars, and bats) are both popular in Vietnam as a result of population growth and urban prosperity (Cooper 1995; Drury 2011; Deutsch and Murakhver 2012). Such activities increase the likelihood of pathogen transfer between wildlife, humans and domestic animals (Krause 1994).",

Samples were enriched for viruses, after which nucleic acid was extracted (de Vries et al. 2011, 2012). All nucleic acids were transcribed and subjected to second strand synthesis. Prepared dsDNA were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. The resulting dsDNA from each sample was sheared and fractionated to 400\u2013500 bp in length, after which Illumina adapters with a unique barcode were ligated to the fragments. Resulting libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platforms to generate 3\u20134 million 250 bp paired-end reads per sample (Munnink et al. 2017). The quality of the reads was assessed using FASTQC (Davis et al. 2013). Primers and lower quality bases were trimmed using Cutadapt (Marcel 2011). Read pairs likely to have derived from host organisms (limited to humans, pigs and rodents), bacteria or archaea were identified and removed with Kraken (Wood and Salzberg 2014). De novo assembly on remaining read pairs (presumed viral) was conducted using CLC Assembly Cell V 5.0.4 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/clc-assembly-cell/). The resultant contigs were compared with the NCBI GenBank nt database using BLASTn.",

Different combinations of substitution models, clock models and population size models were evaluated by using the path sampling sampling to estimate marginal likelihoods (Baele et al. 2012). The best fitting model was a general time-reversible model with a gamma distribution (G) across sites as the substitution model, with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock model and with a constant size coalescent process prior over the phylogenies. The MCMC chains were run for 100 million iterations with sub-sampling every 10,000 iterations and 10% burn-in. MCMC convergence and effective sample size of parameter estimates were evaluated using Tracer 1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk). Our sequence data were obtained from samples collected over a short time period (within 5 years) so cannot be used to generate robust estimates of the substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Therefore, we applied an informative prior on the substitution rate parameter using a normal distribution (mean rate = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year; SD =5 \u00d7 10\u22124) based on published evolution rates of the VP1 gene of related picornaviruses in both humans and non-humans, as is fully described in our previous study (Lu et al. 2016). An asymmetric model with Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable selection (BSSVS) was applied to identify statistically significant transition rates between host species and geographic locations. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized using Tree Annotator and visualized using FigTree v1.4.0 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",

Comparing the entire coding region (2, 164aa), a Vietnamese bat kobuvirus (MF947437) showed 87% aa identity to a Vietnamese rodent kobuvirus (MF947446) as well as to KoV-SewKTM. MF947437 also showed 74% aa identity to a mouse kobuvirus (JF755427), but only 40% aa identity to a known bat kobuvirus (KJ641686). Comparing the VP1 region only, the Vietnamese bat kobuvirus sequences shared 82\u201392% aa identity to rodent kobuviruses (Supplementary Fig. S2). The time-scaled phylogeny of VP1 regions showed that the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses and the clade of rodent kobuviruses were close related with a TMRCA estimated at \u223c100 years but with some uncertainty (mean 99 years, 95% HPD 55\u2013164 years). Vietnamese bat sequences may have a more recent TMRCA with mean estimate of 43 years (95% HPD 10\u201378 years) (Fig. 1). Further metagenomic investigations indicated that the bat faecal samples belonged to two bat species: Scotophilus kuhlii and Murina ussuriensis. These two bat species are within the family Vespertilionidae and are commonly found in Asia (Parker, Rambaut, and Pybus 2008). Further ancestral reconstruction of Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences indicated possible cross-species transmission between the two species (with BF > 100), despite the limited sample size (Fig. 4). In addition, we observed that the Vietnamese bat kobuvirus VP1 sequences were separated into two subclades. It is unclear whether the clustering of the two subclades was associated with bat species differentiation as the uneven samples from two bat species (37 samples from S.kuhlii n = 37 and 1 sample from M.ussuriensis), and is also not related to geographic separation though the bat faecal samples, which were known to be collected from two districts (Cao Lanh and Chau Tang) in Dong Thap province (Supplementary Fig. S3).\n",

Four (MF947441, MF947407, MF947442, and MF947408) were identified in hospitalized young children (2 months to 2 years old) with diarrhoea, only one patients (where MF947442 were isolated from) had contact with animals (kept dogs and cats at home) in the record. Two (MF947409 and MF947410) were isolated from adult farm workers who had close contact with animals (including domestic pigs, chickens, ducks, dogs, and cats). None of them had contact with rodents and bats in the record. The estimated mean TMRCA of AiV-A1 overall (including three Genotypes A\u2013C) was 73 years with 95% HPD= 41\u2013218 years. Genotypes A and B have similar TMRCAs, originating in the early 1980 s (mean = 35 years and 95% HPD = 17\u201340 years for Genotype A; mean = 33 years and 95% HPD = 22\u201343 years for Genotype B). Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene sequences showed that the six AiV-A1 sequences found in our study all belonged to Genotype B with an estimated TMRCA around 2006. They were close related to other Genotype B sequences isolated from southeast China and South Korea in 2008 and 2010. Two AiV-A1 sequences (EU143279 and EU143278) have been previously detected in Dong Thap province in 2002 and 2003; they belong to Genotype A (Pham et al., 2008). This result may indicate the current dominant AiV-A1 in Dong Thap province in Vietnam is Genotype B, the ancestor of which existed and spread in this area over a 10-year time frame (Supplementary Fig. S4).",

            "text": "Similar to rodents, bats are one of the most diverse and widely distributed mammals. They are a natural reservoir for many important emerging infectious viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses, lyssaviruses, filoviruses, and mammalian paramyxovirus (Johara et al. 2001; Leroy et al., 2005; Calisher et al. 2006; Drexler et al. 2012a). Bat-derived viruses can be transmitted to other host species via contamination of food with bat excreta, or direct exposure to bat blood or excreta, or infection via intermediate hosts (Quan et al. 2013). Pathogens derived from other animals may also spill over into bats, as some bat species feed on small vertebrates such as rats and birds (Morrison 1983). Therefore, there is a possibility of a bat-derived virus transmitting to rodents living in the same environment or vice versa. In this study, we described a rodent-like kobuvirus from bat specimens in Dong Thap province in Vietnam. However, direct evidence of virus spill over between rodents and bats is still lacking. Ancestral reconstruction analysis indicated that kobuviruses are more likely to jump from rodents to bats, although this result had only weak support. Given that the common ancestor of the two lineages existed >100 years ago, there could also be an unknown host of both lineages and the host jump event may have occurred somewhere a long time before. In addition, the Vietnamese bat kobuviruses found in our study were distinct from the species AiV-F and unassigned kobuviruses previously found in bats, indicating that bat-derived kobuviruses are quite diverse. In comparison, high genetic diversity has also been observed among bat-derived hepaciviruses, which raises the possibility that other hepaciviruses, including HCV, may have originated from bats (Kapoor et al. 2011b; Drexler et al. 2012b; Quan et al. 2013). However, for kobuvirus, although the clade of Vietnamese bat kobuviruses is adjacent to the clade of human kobuviruses, there is no clear evidence to show that AiV-A1 originated from bats. Further investigation and discovery of kobuvirus sequences over larger geographical scales and in other host species may help to clarify the evolutionary connections.",

This is the first large-scale study investigating kobuviruses in human and animals. The sequences obtained in this study provide new information on the occurrence of these viruses in a wider range of hosts than previously known. Cross-species transmission events are revealed at the host order, family and species levels. Further molecular and epidemiological studies are required to determine the relevance, distribution, and diversity of kobuviruses in larger geographic scales and over time.",
