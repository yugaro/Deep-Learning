All reported cases originated in the Arabian Peninsula or can be epidemiologically linked to an index case via an infected traveler from the region; however, the reason for prolonged persistence of infection in human populations despite a low reproductive number (R)3 remains unknown. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV, with a slow, sporadic pattern and prolonged persistence, contrasts sharply to SARS, which had a higher estimated R value and yet peaked in a classic epidemic pattern and was over within eight months.4 Local transmission of MERS-CoV has been reported in various familial and hospital settings, but appears limited and variable, suggesting that the infectivity of the virus is low.2,5,6 The fact that new infections continue to occur over two years after emergence points to an ongoing source of new infections that is not yet elucidated.",

However, phylogenetic analysis has identified a close relationship between MERS-CoV in humans and various bat species.7\u201310 Additionally, MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-like antibodies have been identified in dromedary camels,11\u201323 suggesting that MERS-CoV is widespread, and previously infected various camel populations (including countries where human cases have yet to be reported). The studies have also revealed that MERS-CoV has been in circulation since at least 2003,16 much longer than previously estimated based on the most common ancestor for the MERS-CoV strains found in humans.24 A recent study by Memish et al.25 analyzed the virus in an infected camel and infected caretaker of the camel, and the findings suggested cross-species transmission, though it is unknown if the camel infected the human, or the other way around. Infected camels may therefore represent a direct source to humans, or the virus may have crossed from camels to alternative zoonotic hosts or environmental sources responsible for the recent transmission to humans. Additional evidence supporting camels as a host animal was provided by a recent study that sequenced complete MERS-CoV isolates from five camels in Saudi Arabia, which were shown to be identical to published sequences of human isolates.23 Multiple introductions from zoonotic sources to humans, resulting in limited clusters of cases, is one explanation of the observed epidemiology, although it is unknown how many jumps to humans have occurred, or what the mode of transmission is between the animals and humans.26",

Fig.1(a) shows the striking differences in the epidemiology of SARS and MERS-CoV when cases are plotted from the date of emergence.34\nFig.1(b) illustrates the temporal pattern of all reported cases for MERS-CoV, showing a peak of infections associated with a nosocomial outbreak in Al-Ahsa in May\u2013June 2013, more than a year after the emergence of the virus, and a significant increase in the number of reported cases since March 2014. The pattern in the Al-Ahsa outbreak, which resulted in 26 cases, shows an epidemic curve that on the surface was interpreted as a classic human-to-human, rapid-onset, short time-frame nosocomial outbreak,35 and could possibly represent an evolving epidemiology. Yet, inexplicably, multiple different clades of the virus were identified in that one outbreak, and 3 of 13 transmissions could not be explained by human-to-human transmission, and instead appear to be independent transmission events, all within a very short time period.36 Similar conclusions were reached by Memish et al.37 in a study conducted to identify common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of MERS-CoV reported from the Hafr Al-Batin outbreak. The results indicated multiple sources of transmission, and the authors suggested camels as the most likely source. Evidence for multiple transmission sources is further supported by Briese et al.,23 who found that viral particles from individual camels contained more genetic variation than MERS-CoV isolates from humans. Under the assumption that camels are the source of the virus to humans, only certain genotypes may be able to infect humans, offering a possible explanation as to why human cases are less common.",

The Hajj occurs in approximately October each year, based on the Islamic lunar calendar, during which over 3 million pilgrims congregate in Mecca. During both the 2012 and 2013 Hajj, new MERS-CoV cases were identified in Saudi Arabia. Of specific interest is the fact that no confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Hajj pilgrims were reported either year, despite extreme close contact environments and attempts at surveillance of symptomatic pilgrims.38\u201340 Similarly, no infections have been reported in pilgrims returning from the Umrah pilgrimages, which occurred in July\u2013August 2012 and 2013.2",

This process could also be applied to the periods between other reported MERS-CoV infections. In this analysis, we assume that the source node is responsible for the infection of the target node, and evaluate the minimum number of persons that must have been infected in order to connect the two known reported cases for a range of serial intervals. To compute a lower bound, we assume that there is a chain of infected individuals, each transmitting the infection to a single person that connects the two cases. Because the objective is to quantify a lower bound on the number of missing cases during the 89-day period, we ignore other sources of transmission and the probability of transmission to contacts that do not connect confirmed cases. A recognized limitation of this study is the assumption that the two reported cases are connected. We do acknowledge that MERS-CoV may have infected humans through multiple introductions from a sporadic source, in which case the lower bound in the analysis is effectively zero. Our analysis simply addresses one possible explanatory scenario for the fact that MERS-CoV cases are still being reported in Saudi Arabia. The lack of reported infections elsewhere during that time, the increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission in multiple clusters, the absence of clear evidence of zoonotic transmission in most human cases nor consistent history of animal contact, and an increasing number of asymptomatic and mild cases revealed in the region supports the reasoning for this simple analysis.",

Given a contact network composed of a single infected individual s and C susceptible contacts, the infected individual s poses a risk of infection to all susceptible contacts. For the simple contact network evaluated, the relationship between p and expected R0 is R0 = NHp, where H is the exposure period during the Hajj, N is daily number of contacts, and p is the probability of transmission per contact. If p is the probability of infection per contact (per day) during the Hajj, the likelihood of an infected individual s not infecting any group member can be modeled as a binomial experiment B(n,p), where n = C*H. We compute the probability of k = 0 successes, or the probability of no secondary infections resulting from a single infected individual s, which depends on p, C, and H. We therefore consider a range of transmission probabilities and group sizes in the analysis presented. The results are presented in Figs.2 and 3.",

Using a maximum serial interval of 35 days, based on the upper bounds for the latent period and infectious period, that is, L = 15 days and D = 20 days,4 respectively, a minimum of three cases were required to form the infection path from the June 6 to September 3 cases; hence, only one unreported case during this 89-day period was required for the virus to have remained in circulation. The apparently low infectivity of the virus and recent asymptomatic cases in screened contacts2 suggests that this scenario is plausible; however, this relies on the significant assumption that the two reported cases in June and September are linked. If the lower bounds of the latent and infectious period are used, that is, L = 2 and D = 1, corresponding to a serial interval of 3, the minimum number of undetected cases increases to 28. Using the serial interval estimated from the Al-Ahsa outbreak of 7.6 days,35 the expected number of cases required to link the June and September cases was also computed, and equal to 12.

For this reason, we quantified the likelihood that at least one individual was infectious with MERS-CoV during the Hajj, but did not result in a single secondary infection, which would be consistent with observed data. Given the low number of reported cases and known opportunity for transmission, the MERS-CoV behaves like a disease with a very low transmission probability. Based on these observations, the analysis will only consider the range of p < 0.02, where p is the probability of transmission per contact.",

            "text": "The key question remaining is: What is the source of ongoing infection that has sustained MERS-CoV for over 25 months in the human population and yet not resulted in an epidemic or even a few cases during either the 2012 or 2013 Hajj? The observed pattern of infections could be explained by several scenarios. One scenario is a predominance of sporadic human cases resulting from direct exposure to a nonhuman source (with speculation being camels) with minimal potential for human-to-human transmission. While camels have been confirmed hosts of the virus, the mode of transmission from camels to humans remains unknown. Genetic sequencing of numerous MERS-CoV isolates suggests multiple introductions to humans from a zoonotic source; however, unrecognized sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out.36,37 At this point, no consistent pattern of zoonotic exposure has been found in human cases of MERS-CoV, although ongoing testing of plausible zoonotic and environmental sources for infection will help in identifying any source of sporadic, ongoing infection.",

            "text": "Another explanation is sustained human-to-human transmission, masked by unreported, mild, or undetected infections. Undetected mild cases have been posited as a factor in the apparent decrease in the case fatality rate over time in a model estimating a 940 (95%CI 290\u20132,200) symptomatic cases with 62% undetected.3 However, the results from our first analysis expose the possibility that only a few undetected cases could have allowed MERS-CoV to be sustained in the population over a three-month period solely via human-to-human transmission. While there is some evidence of human-to-human transmission, subclinical or mild infection has only been documented in those associated with family clusters, and only detected during extensive contact tracing, which does not support the presence of large numbers of undetected cases. Furthermore, large-scale nasopharyngeal sampling of Hajj pilgrims38 and a serological survey of blood donors and abattoir workers33 failed to identify nasal carriage or serological evidence of widespread infections in the population. Diagnostic serology and contact investigation of close contacts is important to determine asymptomatic or mild infection. The need for further serological surveys or other surveillance in affected areas to determine whether a large burden of disease has gone undetected is also necessary. Finally, it is possible that we are experiencing an early-stage epidemic caused by a still evolving virus that is adapting over time to become more transmissible; however, preliminary reports of genetic sequencing suggest that this does not appear to be the case.45",

The combination of a sporadic source(s) and some human-to-human transmission best fits the available facts; however, most cases lack a clear history of zoonotic exposure. The number of sporadic introductions into the population and extent to which sustained human-to-human transmission persists in the population remains uncertain. Our study raises further questions about the unusual and yet unexplained epidemiology of MERS-CoV, which is very different from any other emerging infection in recent history, and should be further explored as a matter of public health urgency.",
