The effectiveness of these initiatives depends on the effectiveness of regional and international cooperation on health challenges and issues.[1] There are, however, little substantive information and knowledge gaps on how international cooperation and activities can best be used as tools for the management of global health and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[1,2] China-Africa heath development initiatives is timely to address public health and health research gaps, South-South health development platforms and cooperation in shaping innovative national health evidence policies, priorities, programs and benefits in developing countries. International bilateral or multilateral cooperation on health development has been evolving rapidly since the late twentieth century to meet the increasing needs of vulnerable populations, moving forward effective Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and SDGs.[2,3] In addition, to face the challenges of health and epidemiologic transitions, ageing and globalization challenges, collaborative diplomacy on health security have become more vital than ever in not only saving lives and improving public health but also in improving and providing long lasting benefits to both world\u2019s poorest and developed countries. At the same time, however, the rising concern on response and funding from international health actors (WHO, World Bank, UN/UNDP, etc.) remains challenging and requires more efforts and collaboration in harmonizing multilateral efforts and timely actions in emergencies situations.[4,5] While the news have often reported on the growth of Chinese involvement in Africa, there has been very little literature on its effects on public health. There is a need for deeper analysis on China\u2019s cooperation and efforts at improving public health large-scale development in Africa. There are no statistics showing declines in mortality or disease burden. Furthermore, it\u2019s still unclear exactly how the Chinese approach differs from the Western approach, as the difference between the \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d approaches are never described practically or operationally.[3,4,6]",

Also, strengthening health systems in scaling up health and medical skills transfer to achieve universal coverage, health equity and overall long-term benefits of improved quality healthcare delivery towards sustainable national development and growth.[2,3,6] Reciprocally, to support China in meeting up with the growing demand on natural resources and citizenry needs, international laws and declarations are critical areas for international cooperation. The current political environment and commitment to address health problems has created unprecedented opportunities for bilateral health cooperation.[4,5] Furthermore, as China has become an increasingly important part of global health over the past decades, interest in China\u2019s international health cooperation has increased among public health professionals internationally and in China.[3,5,6] Thus, this systematic analysis of China-Africa cooperation is timely in leveraging on infectious diseases and poverty alleviation health experiences and lessons learned in reshaping strategic health diplomacy formulation and enhancing successful approaches in health programs and networks in Africa.[5,7]",

The Chinese government worked with international community, humanitarian agencies and frontline non-governmental organizations including African countries to contain and control Ebola epidemics in West Africa. Compared to other developed countries, China provided a robust technical and non-technical assistance to 13 countries in and around the affected West Africa sub-region valued at about $120 million (USD), and pledged an extra $5 million (USD) to the UN Response Multi-partner Trust Fund to support recovery and rehabilitation process of the affected countries. In addition, China also provided logistics in major affected provinces, including the supply and free distribution of Ebola protection kits, mobile laboratory testing vehicles and building new national Ebola research laboratories. Also skills development of over 13,000 health workers and health professional were improved through training and capacity development.

There were more than 200 participants, including the health ministers of China and over 40 African countries, as well as representatives from the AU and international organizations such as the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. The meeting adopted the Cape Town Declaration and its implementation framework to promote China-Africa collaboration in public health. It developed a roadmap for China and African countries to work together to address the key health problems affecting the African continent. The latter Johannesburg Summit was the second summit since the inception of FOCAC 20 years ago and the first held in Africa. The timely conference resulted in upgrading new type of China-Africa relationship into a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. As a marked indication of this collaboration, China pledged to provide $60 billion (USD) funding support for 10 major China-Africa cooperation plans to be implemented in health-related challenges and issues. These ranged from addressing poor access and availability of quality and essential medicines and medical devices, weak health systems and capacity development, lack of entrepreneurship and technology transfer, unreliable and inexistent monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs/projects. Noteworthy, weak regional approach and national sustained health policy reforms, inadequacies in skills and knowledge capabilities to tackle emerging epidemics and infectious diseases with limited resources were documented and should be addressed.",

China has also strengthened cultural and educational exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation in an effort to improve Africa\u2019s ability to develop independently. China has offered assistance to Africa in digging wells for water supplies, and in building affordable housing, broadcasting and telecommunications facilities, and cultural and educational sites in an effort to improve the productive and living conditions of local people. Since 2009, China has carried out dozens of well-digging projects in the Sudan, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Guinea and Togo, playing a positive role in easing water problems for local people. It has also provided support for the building of portable dwellings in South Sudan, schools in Benin, and rural schools in Malawi, and in doing so, improved local living conditions and educational facilities.

Supporting cultural and educational exchanges make up an important part of the new type of strategic partnership between China and Africa. By supporting young Africans studying in China, sending young Chinese volunteers to Africa and developing joint research initiatives, China tries to promote mutual understanding between China and African countries and strengthening the social foundation of their friendship. From 2010 to 2012, China granted 18,743 government scholarships to students from African countries. By the end of 2012, China had sent 408 young Chinese volunteers to 16 African countries. Twenty pairs of leading Chinese and African universities have begun cooperating under the 20+20 Cooperation Plan for Chinese and African Universities. From the launch of China-Africa Joint Research and Exchange Plan in March 2010 to the end of 2012, it had supported 64 projects in the form of workshops, subject research, academic exchanges and publishing, public health forecasting, financial planning and contextual proven interventions.

With the situation turning more serious and based on the needs of epidemic regions, China later announced three consecutive rounds of assistance.

CAD Fund is one of the eight measures which was announced by Chinese government at the Beijing Summit of the FOCAC in November 4th, 2006 aimed to support Chinese companies to develop the cooperation with Africa and enter the African market.[1,3,5] Distinctive characteristics in the capital nature, the business area, and operation mode is continually following the investment philosophy: to build up \u201cbridge linking\u201d and \u201cconnection\u201d of the economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa; to enhance self-develop capability of Africa; to strictly fulfill the investment environment and social responsibility; to promote mutually beneficial and win-win between China and Africa by market-oriented operation.[5,7,21] CAD-Fund is a pioneering move in the process of mutual and beneficial China-Africa cooperation. It remedied the gap under the traditional model of free aid and loans. With the increasing African countries double public health burden (chronic illnesses and infectious diseases), new investment models and market-oriented economic development and operation should be examined in achieving sustained and healthy dual or self-development.[9,11,18] Moreover, promoting the role of international organizations and agencies in boosting existing partnerships, to guide and support Chinese enterprises to develop the direct investment is essential. Improving people\u2019s livelihood for African regions by additional large scale (e.g.: network project) investment to African countries could be beneficial in long terms.[14,20] For instance, the Chinese government officially approved the establishment of the CAD-Fund, with first-phase funding, USD 1 billion, provided by China Development Bank. CAD-Fund operated independently based on market economy principles under a standardized corporate governance structure. China Development Bank (CDB), the shareholder, has a great wealth of experience in project review and management and is backed up with sound expert resources. Having invested in five funds and three specialized fund management companies, the bank has developed sophisticated fund management and risk control systems. CDB has accumulated profound experience vis-\u00e0-vis investing in Africa through its \u201cGoing Global\u201d initiative.[19-21] CDB, by virtue of its overall resources and advantages, will provide a high level of professional support. Again, on the investment side, the Ministry of Commerce revealed that China\u2019s direct investment in Africa stood at $1.19 billion (USD) in the first half of 2014, falling over 40 percent year on year. The downturn is attributed to the sluggish global economic recovery, international commodity fluctuations, and the Ebola outbreaks.[8,17,21]",

These have precipitated growing opportunities in internationalization of south-south and south-north health cooperation in changing outcomes.[8,9] The advances in technological development and increases in global interconnections are increasingly being utilized inexpensive and prompt health information communication diffusion broadly and interdependence between different people, regions and continent benefits.[8,9] Improvements in communication and information technologies has enabled international responses to health threats and disaster crisis more rapidly and in a coordinated fashion,[7] bringing about greater sharing of information and increasing international interactions and collaboration.[10] Globalization requires increasing cooperation among countries to ensure the stability and security of the global system, a reason why implementation of international agreements and joint declarations has become important.[10,21] For instance, industrial demand and globalization coupled with intense urbanization have been generating new ecological, climate and environmental threats and associated consequences beyond local, regional boundaries and worldwide. These consequences and issues have raised the need for international cooperation and foreign assistance agreements either as direct delivery of services, capacity transfer or implementation of health interventions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[5,8,10,22] In today\u2019s more interdependent world, international cooperation, which involves the interaction of countries, international organizations and non-government actors, shapes values, policies and rules. As globalization continues to widen the gaps, development and implementation of comprehensive health models between developing and developed nations, the interest in global health partnership and foreign assistance effectiveness has grown in importance at improving funding on health systems priorities including scaling up access to essential medicines and service delivery, universal health coverage and building new primary healthcare facilities.[11,18,20,21]",

According to the statistics by Chinese customs, crude oil, iron ore, diamonds, and agricultural products together accounted for 56.5 percent of Chinese imports from Africa during the first three quarters of 2015. And this number is on the low end because China\u2019s demand for raw materials has been suppressed by its economic slowdown this year. In this sense, China\u2019s intention of downplaying the importance of natural resources in Sino-Africa trade in its policy manifestation is clear, given the mutually understandable win-win image associated with Sino-Africa economic relations aspirations. China\u2019s International health development cooperation initiatives since the 1980s, health privatization and reforms expectations and outcomes from international coalitions were formed to address the heavy global challenges, including national burden of infectious diseases, poverty and inequality. With the global funds support from early 2000, the vertical approach to funding and aid has been gradually shifting to a horizontal approach and from mere bilateral efforts to multilateral organizations, local and international NGOs, aimed at reshaping major funding, cooperation, new alliances and networks.[10,13] Furthermore, boosting provision of aid or humanitarian assistance paradigm shift from a small-scale task plan to large multiple programs financial support projects and programs.",

Reciprocally, from 1994 to 2001, the EU contributed \u20ac4.5 million to HIV/AIDS prevention in China, setting up six provincial level regional training centers to provide technical assistance to medical personnel in HIV/AIDS prevention.[14,15] This collaborative support is advantageous for capacity building, educational exchanges between institutions of all levels and dual technology transfer. Such efforts have been reported between China and the United Kingdom (UK), the US, and Australia in research and development and helpful in solving health issues and developmental challenges including climate changes and globalization of trade and travel.[8,11,16] Previously, the establishment of cooperation between China and other countries has been done through the signing of agreements and regular corporate communication. Contemporary advances in implementation mechanisms are performed by joint engagement and participation in mutual win-win partnership and joint health programs funding or investment seeking based on local and national priorities and real time field interventions.[17,19] Furthermore, China has dispatched more than 50 medical teams and more than 1,000 medical personnel to 39 African countries. Chinese governments highly valued and appraised local people and the team\u2019s devotion, willingly and generosity in providing medical services, training and technical assistance, in strengthening health systems development through FOCAC partnership.[3,6,9] In contrast to previous international vertical health approach, Chinese horizontal approach and process (people-people approach and relations) has been appraised in responding to the need of the populations. There is an urgent need for reliable and effective evidence in strengthening health systems development including constructing health care facilities, providing medicines and medical equipment, improving more targeted care access and utilization require contextual and scalable community-based programs and activities beneficial to both Chinese and African citizenry.[1,3,7,14,15]",

Addressing knowledge gaps between the developing and developed countries require innovative international and multilateral cooperation with priorities on significant infectious diseases, emerging epidemics, the rise of obesity related cardiometabolic and other chronic diseases. The MDGs, adopted and supported after the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in September 2000, provided a substantial progress in the reduction of poverty and marked improvements in infectious diseases and some neglected tropical diseases in most endemic countries through the Global Funds. It also offered other bilateral aid to the poorest and vulnerable populations worldwide by improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, while combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.[5,8,12,21-23] Attaining the SDGs and health for all by 2050 depends primarily on national efforts supported by domestic and regional public-private partnerships and global strategy of increasing access of the world\u2019s poor to essential health services. It also depends on support from international multilateral cooperation and collaboration within countries.[15,17,20] Further efforts should be devoted at reducing inequality and poverty in health aimed at accelerating progress towards the SDGs and should be a pubic priority. It is worth mentioning that there is still disproportionate health disparity between developing and developed countries.[19,21] For example children life expectancy chances are dramatically different depending on where they are born. In China life expectancy is longer than in African countries due to premature mortality ratio associated with malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as chronic infections, mainly maternal-child and elderly healthcare delivery.[13,23,27,28]",

Such recent efforts in the field of public health include multiple partnerships between the National Institute for Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Shanghai with several African institutions and universities in the areas of capacity development and training, technology transfer and exchanges coordination and leadership.[19,23,30] Most importantly, is the implementation of malaria and schistosomiasis elimination networks across Africa (e.g., Tanzania, Zanzibar, Sudan).[17,33] Lessons learned and technical assistance from Chinese researchers, ongoing consultation on strategic partnership could be very important in strengthening joint malaria and schistosomiasis projects network with Sudan, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mali are substantial opportunities.",
