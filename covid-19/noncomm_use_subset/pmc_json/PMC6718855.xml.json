The mortality rate was calculated as all mechanically ventilated patients who died in ICUs during the study period over the total number of mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs during the same year. Also, we estimated the length of stay in ICUs for those patients as we collected information on time and date of receiving mechanical ventilation, time and date of death, and time and date of ICU discharge. Moreover, for the adult population, the following information was collected from each patient\u2019s medical file on the day of ICU admission: 1) demographic variables, body mass index (BMI) (categorized into underweight, normal, overweight, and obese); 2) source of ICU admission (from emergency department, other that includes hospital ward, transfer from other hospital, or outpatient department); 3) Glasgow coma scale that (classified into severe brain injury, score 1-8; moderate brain injury, score 9-12, and mild brain injury, score 13-15); 4) mechanical ventilator setting; 5) cause of the initiation of mechanical ventilation (classified into coma, respiratory failure type I, respiratory failure type II, and other causes such as involved in motor vehicle accidents, burns, or post-operative complications); and 6) diagnosis at ICU admission (mapped on the ICD-10 classification of disease). For pediatric patients, we also extracted information on the demographics (in which we classified the age into first month, 2-12 months, and more than 12 months), source of ICU admission (from ER, labor suite, or other hospital), gestational week (classified according to the WHO classification of prematurity), cause of the initiation of mechanical ventilation (classified into prematurity with respiratory problems, respiratory distress syndrome, post-operation, and congenital), and diagnosis at ICU admission (mapped on the ICD-10 classification of disease).",

The primary outcome measure was the mortality during the ICU stay after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to describe the probability of survival after the initiation of mechanical ventilation; thus the exit time was set as the earliest of either the death date or the ICU discharge date. To examine the association effect of the factors on the survival among those who survived and those who died, a univariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), whereby p<0.05 was considered as significant. The statistical analyses were performed using STATA\u00ae software, version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).",

A total of 30 (17%) of this study population died after the date of mechanical ventilation with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days). The mortality rate was 9.9 per 1000-person years (95%, CI 6.96 to 14.25). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 30-day ICU mortality as shown in Figure 3. The curve shows that by the end of one month, 75% of patients on mechanical ventilation are still alive. The characteristic of the population as demonstrated in Table 3. The main source of the admission of those neonates was labor and delivery by C-section, with the mean gestational week being 32 (SD 5) weeks. Prematurity with respiratory problems (50%) was the main recorded cause of the initiation of mechanical ventilation, followed by respiratory distress syndrome (37%). The majority of admissions to ICUs were premature. Neonates who received mechanical ventilation within the first month of their life and who were born extremely preterm had a high mortality rate after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. A total of 169 (96%) of the neonates were intubated in ICU while only 3% had already been intubated before their ICU admission. Variables related to mechanical ventilation parameters on day one of mechanical ventilation are presented in Table 3. For the results of the univariate analysis of factors associated with mortality among this population, Table 4 shows that neonates who received mechanical ventilation within the first month of life and who were born extremely preterm had a high mortality rate after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. In addition, those neonates who had respiratory distress syndrome as the cause of initiating the mechanical ventilation had a high rate of mortality; however, the univariate analysis showed no significant association. Neonates who had congenital anomalies as the cause of receiving mechanical ventilation were more likely to have a lower survival rate (OR 13, 95% CI 2.68-62.8).",

            "text": "Thus, in the published research, many studies have reported that age is an independent factor associated with mortality.8 Those studies have shown an effect of age on the mortality of patients who received mechanical ventilation, whereby they reported that age has an independent effect on the outcomes of those patients. Our data showed a higher percentage of patients who died after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the 3 age categories 51-60, 61-70, and more than 71 years old. Also, the results of this study showed that the percentage of patients who were overweight was higher compared to the percentage of patients who died after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the same category. This finding supports the concept of the obesity paradox, whereby many studies have indicated that obesity and morbid obesity are associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with ARDS.22 However, this was not significant in the univariate analysis",

Additionally, in the current study the majority of the pediatric population was within one month of age, thus this population is different from classic pediatric patients and this finding limits our generalizability of the results to the wider pediatric population.",

They found that the survival of ICU patients depends on factors that develop during the course of the ventilation in addition to those factors that cause the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Although this point is considered a limitation in the current study, as we did not collect such information, the main aim of this study was to estimate the survival of a heterogeneous group of patients who were admitted to the ICU and required mechanical ventilation at one center in Saudi Arabia. Thus at a national level, many studies have been carried out that estimated mortality as one of many outcomes of patients admitted to ICUs.11 Thus, a limited number of studies has addressed this issue among patients with certain conditions such as malignancy or acute renal failure.13,25 An important consideration in our study was the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection that occurred during the study period. Thus, MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to ICUs was associated with high mortality, as 72% such patients died in ICUs.12",

Both KAMC and KACSH assign ICD-10 diagnosis codes for ICU admission diagnosis, whereby we adopt the same categories in the classification of the reason for ICU admission. Although this may be complex, re-grouping the principal diagnoses of ICU admission into mutually exclusive categories would impose further challenges as we may under- or overestimate the association of specific categories with others. On the other hand, one of the limitations of the study is related to the information concerning the severity of the patients: the APACHE II score, chronic use of corticosteroids, failure previous to mechanical ventilation, and other conditions occurring during mechanical ventilation were not studied. This study was observational in nature and the effect of many factors as well as unmeasured confounders cannot be fully controlled. However, we acknowledge that the presence of such information would be useful to give the full picture of our study population. Thus, based on previous studies, the severity of the disease and co-existing comorbidity are predictor factors associated with higher mortality among ICU patients. The small sample size in this study is considered one of the limitations of our analysis. Nevertheless, our purpose was to assess the overall mortality among mechanically ventilated patients who were admitted to the ICU in one center. A further retrospective multicenter study with appropriate statistical power and study design to include further confounders is essential to provide more realistic survival data on ICU patients in Saudi Arabia.",
