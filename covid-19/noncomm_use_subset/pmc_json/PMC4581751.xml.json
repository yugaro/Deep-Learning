            "text": "Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are disorders caused by an acute infection, commonly involving the nose, sinuses, pharynx or larynx. The various URTIs include the common cold, sinusitis, laryngitis and pharyngitis (1). URTIs are usually caused by viruses, including rhinovirus, corona-virus, Para influenza virus and adenovirus (2). Certain URTIs also result from bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoneae, Heamophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Bordetela pertursis and Bacillus anthracis (3). Bronchitis, which is inflammation of the mucosal membranes of the bronchi, is also caused by certain types of bacteria, with ~10% of cases caused by bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella perturis and S. pneumoniae (4,5). S. pyogenes is a spherical, Gram-positive bacterium, and causes > 700,000,000 infections worldwide each year and >650,000 cases of severe, invasive infections with mortality rates of 25%. S. pyogenes the cause of several important human diseases, ranging from mild skin infections to potentially fatal systemic disorders. Infections typically begin in the throat or skin, with pharyngitis being common in S. pyogenes infection. Infections caused by certain strains of S. pyogenes are associated with the release of bacterial toxins, which in certain throat infections results in scarlet fever (6). Certain strains of S. pyogenes have now developed resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines and clindamycin, indicating the requirement for novel antibacterial agents (7\u201310).",

Essential oils were among the first topical and gastrointestinal antimicrobial agents used by humans. Due to the extensive use of conventional antibiotics and synthetic antimicrobial drugs, there has been an increase in the widespread development of drug resistant microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumonia and P. aeruginosa (11,12). Essential oils and their components target bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes, resulting in permeabilization, which is followed by the loss of ions, reduction of the membrane potential, collapse of the proton pump and depletion of the adenosine triphosphate pool (13\u201315). Due to their multifunctionality, essential oils have wide applications in medicine and aromatherapy. Essential oils exhibit potent antimicrobial actions against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (16). Essential oils have also traditionally been used for treating respiratory tract infections, and as an ethnic treatment for colds (17\u201319). Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute sinusitis and acute and chronic bronchitis and it has been reported that inhalation therapy using volatile essential oil vapors enhances the respiratory tract fluid output (20 maintains ventilation and drainage of the sinuses, reduces asthma, and reduces inflammation of the trachea (21\u201323).",

Several studies have investigated the chemical constituents of A. vestita, and a number of flavones, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenoids have been isolated. The chemical composition of the essential oil of A. vestita has also been investigated (24\u201326). At present, to the best of our knowledge, the in vivo and in vitro antibacterial activity of A. vestita against respiratory infection-causing bacteria has not been reported previously, and the detailed mechanism of action of A. vestita essential oil on bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study is the first on the A. vestita essential oil, in which in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities against the respiratory infection-causing bacteria, S. pyogenes (ATCC-12344), MRSA, S. pneumoniae (ATCC-2730), K. pneumoniae (ATCC-27853) and H. influenzae (ATCC-33391) are investigated. The effects of the oil on biofilm formation and its architecture, and its effect on leakage of potassium ions (K+) from S. pyogenes was also investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the essential oil and its major component, grandisol, on hepatotoxic- and nephrotoxic-associated biochemical parameters in a S. pyogenes-infected mice model were evaluated.",

To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the antibacterial activity of grandisol. In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of the A. vestita essential oil and its two major constituents, 1,8-cineole and grandisol, were investigated against common respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains. The essential oil and the two components exhibited potent in vitro bacterial growth inhibition. Survival curve measurements indicated that the essential oil of A. vestita lead to death of almost 99% of the bacteria within 4 h. The essential oil also induced leakage of K+ ions from S. pyogenes. SEM indicated that the essential oil of A. vestita also inhibited biofilm formation by S. pyogenes and altered its architecture.",

However, treatment with higher concentrations of the essential oil and grandisol significantly reduced the number of viable S. pyogenes bacterial cells in the lungs compared with the control. The essential oil (100 \u03bcg/mouse) produced therapeutically potent effects in reducing the number of viable bacterial cells of S. pyogenes in the lungs of the mice. A higher concentration of grandisol (135 \u03bcg/ml) was required to produce similar bactericidal effects in reducing the number of viable cells in the lungs.

Various strains of S. pyogenes have now developed resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines and clindamycin, indicating the requirement for novel antibacterial agents, including essential oils. The Food and Drug Administration categorizes essential oils and their components as 'generally regarded as safe' chemicals with few side-effects (42). This fact, coupled with their multicomponent nature, makes essential oils promising candidates for future non-antibiotic anti-infective drugs, since developing resistance against multicomponent agents is difficult.",
