Since its first outbreak in 1987 in USA (3), PRRS has spread to the major pig-producing countries and regions (4), causing tremendous economic losses to the world pig industry. The emergence and prevalence of highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV with a 30-aa discontinuous deletion in its nsp2-coding region devastated the Chinese swine industry in 2006 (5,6). PRRSV, a single positive-stranded RNA virus, is classified into the genus Arterivirus of family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (7\u20139). This virus can be divided into two genotypes, namely types 1 and 2 (10\u201312).",

PRRSV-infected target cells and host pig fail to induce the protein production of type I IFN. IFN-\u03b1 protein was undetectable in lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs, and only a very small amount of IFN-\u03b1 protein could be detected or was undetectable in the culture supernatant of PRRSV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte dendritic cells in vitro (15\u201317). PRRSV cannot induce protein expression of IFN-\u03b1 during viral infection, furthermore it blocks the production of IFN-\u03b1 induced by porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or double-stranded RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in vitro (17,18). However, the mRNA transcription of \u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1 can be activated by PRRSV in host target cells in vitro and in vivo (14,19,20). These findings clearly indicate that PRRSV suppresses the production of type I IFN in host by post-transcriptional and translational control. Although several previous studies exploring the molecular basis for PRRSV-mediated inhibition of type I IFN have demonstrated that PRRSV-encoded nsp 1, nsp 2, and nsp 11 and N protein play key roles in antagonizing the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (21), these focused mainly on the stage of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription, primarily in PRRSV permissive MARC-145 cells or non-permissive human cell culture systems. Therefore, these data have uncertain relevance to the host cells naturally infected with PRRSV. To date, the post-transcriptional mechanism concerning PRRSV-mediated innate immune response escape, especially blocking the production of type I IFN, during viral infection in host cells, remains unclear.",

Although miRNAs can be induced or repressed directly by type I IFN, they play a crucial role in regulating the innate immune response including suppression or enhancement of type I IFN production (23). Moreover, during viral infection, not only can host cellular miRNAs target directly viral RNAs or regulate host antiviral genes to modify the cellular state for performing antiviral functions, but also cellular miRNAs can be manipulated by virus to facilitate viral replication (24,25). Therefore, it is not surprising that PRRSV may interact with host cellular miRNAs to evade the type I IFN response. Actually, several previous studies have demonstrated that cellular miRNAs could be modulated during PRRSV infection (26\u201328), and some miRNAs could promote or inhibit PRRSV replication (29\u201332). Simultaneously, the mRNA transcription of type I IFN could be upregulated or downregulated by PRRSV-influenced cellular miRNAs (33\u201335), however, no literature on how PRRSV-modulating cellular miRNAs manipulate the protein expression of type I IFN have been documented.",

The inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 by PRRSV is of significant difference among different type of cells (36). PRRSV vaccine strain is insensitive to type I IFN in MARC-145 cells, however, in primary PAMs, PRRSV vaccine strain and virulent strain are sensitive to type I IFN. PRRSV has been shown to activate IFN-\u03b2 transcription in porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (14), but in MARC-145 cells, PRRSV inactivates and inhibits IFN-\u03b2 transcription activated by poly I:C (18). In addition to PRRSV strains and cell types, different pig breeds may also exhibit distinct characteristics during PRRSV infection. Compared with other pig breeds, PRRSV replication and proliferation can be suppressed or delayed in the PAMs of landrace pigs (37). Cellular miRNAs in lung tissues show significantly differential expression between tongcheng and landrace pigs during HP-PRRSV infection (27). Moreover, since the ultraviolet light- and heat-inactivated PRRSV cannot suppress type I IFN production induced by TGEV infection or poly I:C stimulation in PAMs, the inhibition of type I IFN by PRRSV in natural host cell may be pathogenicity-related (13). Additionally, the pathogenicity between HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV strains are significantly different in vivo and in vitro, therefore, the question of whether HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV show differences in the regulation and miRNA modulation of type I IFN during viral infection, is of considerable interest.",

PAMs are important host target cells for PRRSV infection and replication. It is helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV to investigate the interaction between the virus and its host cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that PRRSV is a poor inducer of type I IFN in vitro and in vivo (1,50). In the present study, cellular miRNA-mediated regulation of IFN-\u03b2 protein expression was investigated in primary PAMs infected with PRRSV in vitro. Our results showed that the transcription level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was increased, but its protein expression was decreased in PRRSV-infected PAMs in the early stage, suggesting that there was a post-transcriptional inhibition mechanism of IFN-\u03b2 protein expression. Cellular miRNAs, including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were capable of downregulating the porcine IFN-\u03b2 protein expression via targeting the binding sequences of IFN-\u03b2 3\u2032UTR, while porcine native IFN-\u03b2 protein could modulate cellular endogenous miRNAs expression using a negative feedback mechanism.

Our results are consistent with previous studies using PAMs and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (14,20). Studies have demonstrated that some nsps and N protein of PRRSV were involved in inhibiting the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in MARC-145 cells and human cells (21), it is debatable whether these results are similar in natural host cells of PRRSV, as the findings reported on mouse hepatitis virus (51).",

Our results presented that HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9 induced differential levels of IFN-\u03b2 protein expression in PAMs in vitro during early infection, and the post-transcriptional inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 induced by JXwn06 was stronger than that by HB-1/3.9 at the same initial viral infectious dose, indicating that different pathogenic PRRSV strains have different ability in the regulation of IFN-\u03b2 protein expression in vitro. Our data are consistent with the study that the IFN phenotypes induced by PRRSV field isolates were distinct in vitro (20), and is similar to the study that the Chinese HP-PRRSV isolate displayed more inhibitory effect than PRRSV strain VR-2332 in the suppression of CpG-ODN-induced IFN-\u03b1 responses by enriched plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) (50). The differential IFN-\u03b2 response of PAMs to different pathogenic PRRSV strains may be due to the viral distinct characteristics or variation in efficiency of viral infection and replication. Chinese HP-PRRSV JXwn06 possess higher replication efficiency and infection capacity than low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9 in PAMs in vitro at the same initial infectious dose [data not shown, as our similar recent study described by Li et al (52)], which may contribute to the stronger post-transcriptional inhibition effect of porcine IFN-\u03b2 protein expression by HP-PRRSV. Since IFN-\u03b2 is the first batch of host genes expression after PRRSV infection and a few fold changes in its protein level leads to almost amplifying the IFN-\u03b2 effect thousands of times by the signaling cascades (47), the differences between HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 induction in PAMs during early infection might correlate with their different virulence and replication efficiency in vivo. Compared with wild-type viruses, UV- and heat-inactivated PRRSV fail to suppress type I IFN production in vitro induced by TGEV or poly I:C, indicating that virus replication and cytopathogenicity are essential for PRRSV to inhibit the expression of type I IFN (1,53). Previous studies showed that type I IFN induction correlated with the virulence of some viruses (54). Additionally, our recent study showed that HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV elicited differential TNF-\u03b1 subtype production in vitro, suggesting that different pathogenic isolates of PRRSV might possess different capacity to induce other cytokines in vitro (43).",

Given that there is a subset of IFN-\u03b1 and a single IFN-\u03b2 subtype, and neither a single IFN-\u03b1 subtype nor all IFN-\u03b1 can be activated by reported stimuli (57), we chose porcine IFN-\u03b2 to investigate the interaction between miRNAs and type I IFN. In the present study, our results indicated that porcine IFN-\u03b2 protein expression in primary PAMs could be downregulated by cellular let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 which are capable of targeting the binding sequences of porcine IFN-\u03b2 3\u2032UTR. Similar phenomenon has been described by an early study using primary primate macrophages (47). It is possible that porcine IFN-\u03b2 response is modulated at different levels in primary PAMs, even more miRNAs may be involved in this regulation. Therefore, further studies are required to discover additional mechanisms or miRNAs in primary PAMs.",

            "text": "PRRSV has evolved several strategies to evade and antagonize anti-viral immune responses of host including using miRNAs (58). Data presented in this study showed that cellular endogenous miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, were upregulated in PAMs during early infection of PRRSV, and miRNA antagonists enhanced the production of porcine IFN-\u03b2 protein, implying that PRRSV may utilize the cellular miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, to negatively regulate porcine IFN-\u03b2 response post-transcriptionally, and further to facilitate virus replication, since porcine IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to protect PAMs from PRRSV infection (59). Interestingly, similar to Li et al (35), a recent study has demonstrated that miR-26a overexpressed in MARC-145 cells triggered IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway during PRRSV infection, but the protein expression of IFN-\u03b2 was not increased, indicating that miR-26a may modulate the IFN-\u03b2 expression post-transcriptionally (34). Similarly, since miR-373 could downregulate the transcription of IFN-\u03b2 via targeting cellular factors such as NFIA, NFIB, IRAK1, IRAK4 and IRF1, PRRSV could upregulate the expression of miR-373 by elevating Sp1 expression in MARC-145 cells during viral infection (33), which suggests that PRRSV is capable of altering cellular miRNA expression to modulate immune response and to facilitate the viral immune escape. Consistent with this possibility, PRRSV infection can not only suppress host miR-125b and poly I:C-induced miR-23, but also elevate miR-146a, suggesting that these miRNA-mediated regulations might be strategies for PRRSV to evade the type I IFN response (30,33,60,61). Supporting this, many viruses could induce miRNAs to escape from immune responses such as enterovirus 71-induced miR-146a in the mouse model, HCV-induced miR-21 in hepatocytes and respiratory syncytial virus-induced let-7b in DCs (62\u201364). Our present data suggested that porcine IFN-\u03b2 production could be augmented by suppressing the expression of endogenous miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145, which could be a new approach in future exploration to prevent PRRSV infection.",
