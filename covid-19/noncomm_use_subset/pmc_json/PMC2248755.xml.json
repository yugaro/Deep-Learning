Gag is produced by conventional translation whereas Pol requires a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift during the elongation step of translation, which generates the fusion protein Gag-Pol (1, reviewed in 2,3). Previous studies showed that a 2- to 20-fold increase in the Gag-Pol to Gag ratio prevents viral infectivity (4\u20137) and our group showed that a decrease in the frameshift efficiency as low as 30% severely impairs the replication of the virus in cultured cells (8). The Gag-Pol to Gag ratio is therefore critical for viral infectivity and the programmed \u20131 frameshift that determines this ratio represents an interesting target for the development of novel antiretroviral agents against HIV-1.",

            "text": "HIV-1 can use a cap-dependent mechanism to initiate translation of its mRNAs, like most eukaryotic mRNAs (for a review on translation initiation, see 12\u201315). There are two major control steps in eukaryotic cap-dependent translation initiation (see details in Figure 1A). One is the binding of the initiator tRNA, Met-tRNAiMet, to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which requires the participation of the initiation factor 2 (eIF2) associated to GTP. The other one is the binding of the 40S subunit bearing the ternary complex to the 5\u2032 cap structure of the mRNA, which is controlled by the eIF4F complex. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as the TAR RNA structure, can modify the rate of translation initiation. TAR, the transactivation response element, is a 59-nt stem-bulge-loop structure present at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of all HIV-1 mRNAs in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (reviewed in 16). It is also present under a free form of 58-66 nt in the cytoplasm of cells infected with the virus (17,18). In the nucleus, TAR mediates transcription activation by binding to the viral Tat protein and the cellular cyclinT protein (19,20). In the cytoplasm, a low concentration of TAR activates PKR, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, whereas a higher concentration of TAR inhibits this kinase by blocking its dimerization, which is essential for its activity (reviewed in 21). When PKR is activated, it phosphorylates the \u03b1 subunit of eIF2, interfering with translation initiation, whereas, when it is inhibited, the amount of eIF2 phosphorylated decreases and the rate of translation initiation increases.\n",

To this end, we used a dual-luciferase construct (8) which expresses the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the firefly luciferase (Fluc) separated by HIV-1 frameshift region as a fusion protein. Rluc is expressed following conventional rules of translation whereas Fluc expression requires a -1 frameshift in the HIV-1 frameshift region. This type of construct is adapted from Grentzmann et al. (22), who pioneered the use of a dual-luciferase reporter for studying recoding signals. CD4+ T cells (Jurkat) or 293T cells were transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid and TAR was added either in cis or in trans of the reporter mRNA. Several conditions were assayed to characterize the effect of TAR on frameshift efficiency and the involvement of PKR in this effect, such as the introduction of a small or a large amount of TAR in the cells, the use of mutants of TAR that cannot perturb PKR activity and the silencing of PKR expression with short interfering RNA (siRNA).",

            "text": "To measure HIV-1 frameshift efficiency, we used the dual-luciferase reporters pDual-HIV(-1) and (0) (8). These plasmids are derived from pcDNA3.1Hygro+ (Invitrogen) and contain the HIV-1 frameshift region inserted between the coding sequences of the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the firefly luciferase (Fluc). Expression of these genes is under control of a CMV promoter, which is followed by a T7 promoter. Plasmid pDual-HIV(0) differs from pDual-HIV(-1) by the addition of an adenine after the slippery sequence in the frameshift region. Derivatives of pDual-HIV(-1) and (0) were constructed where the TAR sequence was inserted after the CMV and T7 promoters. A TAR-containing fragment flanked with HindIII sites obtained from pcDNA3-RSV-TAR-Rluc plasmid (23), a kind gift from L. DesGroseillers (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al), was cloned in the HindIII site of pDual-HIV to produce pDual-HIV-TAR(-1) and (0), where the TAR sequence is located at a distance of about 40 nt from the 5\u2032 end of the reporter mRNA. To produce pDual-HIV-50TAR(-1) and (0), where the TAR sequence is at a larger distance from the 5\u2032 end of the reporter mRNA, a cassette of a 50-nt non-coding sequence was inserted in the AflII site of pDual-HIV, followed by the insertion of TAR immediately after these 50 nt, in the HindIII site. The oligonucleotides for the cassette were cass50nt-fwd and cass50nt-rev (see the sequence of all the oligonucleotides used in this study in Table 1 of the Supplementary Data). Plasmid pTAR, which expresses the free TAR sequence in trans from the reporter mRNA, was made by inserting the TAR-containing fragment flanked with HindIII sites into the HindIII restriction site of pcDNA3.1Hygro+. Derivatives of pTAR, pTARuucg* and pTAR\u25b5bulge*, which express mutants of TAR, were constructed by cloning oligonucleotide cassettes (cass_TAR-uucg* fwd and cass_TAR-uucg* rev or cass_TAR-bulge* fwd and cass_TAR-bulge* rev) between the two NheI restriction sites present in the TAR sequence of pTAR. In the first mutant, the upper loop, CUGGGA, is replaced with UUCG and, in the second mutant, the bulge UCU preceding the upper loop is deleted. Plasmid pCGN\u25b5C [a generous gift from N. Hernandez, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (24)] expresses a mutant of the TAR-binding protein Tat (Tat*), named TatC30,31A.",

To this end, we used a dual-luciferase construct, pDual-HIV(\u20131), which contains the Rluc and the Fluc reporter genes separated by the HIV-1 frameshift region (Figure 1B). In this construct, the Fluc is produced only by ribosomes that make a \u20131 frameshift when translating the HIV-1 frameshift region. To assess the frameshift efficiency, we used a control construct, pDual-HIV(0), in which an adenine is added after the slippery sequence in the frameshift region, so that the Fluc coding sequence is in-frame with the Rluc coding sequence. The Rluc is synthesized by conventional translation in both (-1) and (0) constructs. Before investigating the effect of TAR, we verified that changes in cap-dependent translation initiation affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. Jurkat cells, a CD4+ T-cell line, were transfected with pDual-HIV(-1) or (0) plasmids and treated with thapsigargin, rapamycin or hippuristanol, three inhibitors perturbing a different step of cap-dependent translation initiation (Figure 1A). The frameshift efficiency, which is 5.1 \u00b1 0.4% in the absence of inhibitors, was increased about twofold in the presence of either one of these three inhibitors (Figure 1C).",

TAR (Figure 2A) was inserted at about 40 nt from the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA in pDual-HIV, generating pDual-HIV-TAR(-1) and (0) (Figure 2B). We avoided placing TAR at the very end of the mRNA, since such a position could interfere with the binding of the 40S subunit to the messenger (23,26,27 and references therein). We first examined the effect of a high amount of TAR that inhibits PKR and stimulates translation initiation (21). The frameshift efficiency was assessed in Jurkat and 293T cells. When 2 \u03bcg of pDual-HIV-TAR were delivered into the cells, the frameshift efficiency was decreased to 70% of its value in absence of TAR in either Jurkat or 293T cells (Figure 2C and D). Under the conditions of these assays, the frameshift efficiency in absence of TAR was 6.1 \u00b1 0.2% in Jurkat cells and 11.3 \u00b1 0.9% in 293T cells. These values, and the value of 5.1 \u00b1 0.4% observed in the experiment described in the preceding section with Jurkat cells that were transfected under slightly different conditions (see details in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section), are comparable to the values obtained with different heterologous systems containing the HIV-1 frameshift region, which were shown to range between 2 and 10% in mammalian cultured cells (8,22,28,29). It can be recalled here that several groups observed that the absolute value of the frameshift efficiencies changes, depending upon various parameters such as the conditions used for the assay and the type of cultured cells (30).\n",

These results indicate that it is the presence of TAR in the cells and not its presence in the reporter mRNA that decreases HIV-1 frameshift efficiency.

In addition to its well-characterized transactivation effect on transcription of the viral mRNAs by binding to TAR, Tat influences translation by inhibiting PKR, either directly by binding this kinase or indirectly by blocking the binding of TAR to PKR (32,33). We used a Tat mutant (Tat*) that can bind TAR and inhibit PKR but cannot transactivate transcription, and, thereby, that does not affect mRNA levels (24). Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the plasmid coding for this Tat mutant and with pDual-HIV, pDual-HIV-TAR or pDual-HIV-50TAR. In the presence of Tat*, the frameshift efficiency was decreased to approximately 60% of its value in absence of Tat* (Figure 3C).

The ratio of Fluc activity to Rluc activity in lysates from these transfectants was unchanged in the presence of pTAR (data not shown), confirming that changes in the Fluc to Rluc ratio observed with stable transfectants expressing the dual-luciferase HIV reporter are due to variations in the frameshift efficiency.

After 24 h, cells were transfected with pTAR in different amounts and harvested 48 h later. As a negative control, an eGFP siRNA mix targeting GFP was used. In the presence of the eGFP siRNA, the frameshift efficiency increases when TAR is present. However, when PKR expression is silenced, this effect disappears, supporting that it is related to PKR activation (Figure 5A). Effective silencing of PKR is achieved under the conditions of the assay as shown in Figure 5B. It can be noted that the response of the cells to the increase in the amount of TAR appears to differ from that in Figure 4. This is due to a difference in the experimental protocol resulting in a lower ratio of the quantity of transfected pTAR to the number of cells (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section).\n",

Our experimental conditions do not drastically affect the expression of our reporters, implying that the changes in the translation initiation rate caused by activation or inhibition of PKR are small and that the changes in eIF2 phosphorylation should be modest. Using western blotting, we could not detect significant variations in the phosphorylation level of eIF2 in 293T or Jurkat cells transfected with different quantities of TAR (data not shown). We nevertheless suggest that the effect of PKR on HIV-1 frameshift efficiency results from changes in eIF2 phosphorylation that are too small to be detected in presence of the endogenous signal for phosphorylated eIF2 in these cells.

The frameshift efficiency of a plant virus, the beet western yellow virus (BWYV), was higher in a reticulocyte lysate than in a wheat germ extract, which has a lower rate of translation initiation (35). Also, the frameshift efficiency of the human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-2), when measured in a reticulocyte lysate, was higher with capped than with uncapped mRNAs, which have a lower rate of translation initiation (36). These observations disagree with our results that show a negative relationship between the rate of translation initiation and the frameshift efficiency. However, Paul et al. (37), when comparing the frameshift efficiency of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) with capped and uncapped mRNAs in a yeast extract, found that increasing the translation initiation rate decreased the frameshift efficiency. Furthermore, Lopinski et al.

The results of Paul et al. (37) and Lopinski et al.(38) are in perfect agreement with our findings, and, in line with them, we present the following model that explains our results (Figure 6).\n",

            "text": "When a ribosome translates the HIV-1 frameshift region, it encounters the frameshift stimulatory signal and makes a pause, its decoding center covering the slippery sequence (39\u201341). During the pause, the ribosome can shift or not the reading frame, and, after the pause, the ribosome unfolds the frameshift stimulatory signal and translation continues. If the upstream ribosome reaches the frameshift region before the signal has refolded, the probability that the frameshift occurs is extremely weak. The spacing between ribosomes translating the HIV-1 frameshift region, which is determined by the rate of translation initiation [basal rate estimated to about one initiation event every 6.5 s (42)], could thus affect the frameshift efficiency. Therefore, if we assume an average elongation speed of five amino acids per second per ribosome, corresponding to a displacement of 15 nt per second on the mRNA (42), the minimal distance between the decoding centers of two ribosomes translating a mRNA would be of about 100 nt. A ribosome covers about 32 nt on the mRNA and heel-printing studies showed that the first base of the P-site codon is at a distance of 12 nt from the 5\u2032 edge of the ribosome and of 20 nt from the 3\u2032 edge (43). From these calculations, there would be about 70 exposed nt between two elongating ribosomes. Thus, the HIV-1 frameshift region, including the 43-nt frameshift stimulatory signal, would be exposed after the passage of the first ribosome. The signal would then re-form, which takes only a few microseconds (44), before the upstream ribosome reaches the region of the mRNA containing the sequence of this signal. However, the pause made by the first ribosome when encountering the signal decreases the distance with the following ribosome, which has continued to progress during the pause of the first ribosome. This second ribosome could reach the region corresponding to the stimulatory signal before this signal could refold, being still partially covered by the first ribosome. A pause of about three seconds for the first ribosome is sufficient to prevent the refolding of the stimulatory signal. The second ribosome would thus avoid frameshifting and the spacing between this ribosome and the third ribosome would not be altered. As a consequence, the third ribosome would encounter the stimulatory signal and pause, and frameshifting would be possible. This analysis shows that the signal affects every other ribosome under basal conditions. According to this model, an increase in the rate of translation initiation would decrease the frameshift efficiency, since ribosomes would be closer to each other and a smaller proportion of ribosomes would encounter the folded frameshift stimulatory signal. Conversely, a decrease in translation initiation would increase the frameshift efficiency since ribosomes would be further apart and it is very likely that each ribosome would encounter the folded signal. Interestingly, Lopinski et al. (38), when studying the effect of a reduced translation initiation rate with the L-A virus in yeast cells, observed that the frameshift efficiency doubled, independently of the severity of the initiation defect. Their interpretation was that every other ribosome encounters the signal under basal conditions and that, with a reduced initiation rate, every ribosome encounters this signal. Our analysis fully supports this interpretation.",

Our results suggest that a change in cap-dependent translation initiation could affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency in infected cells. As mentioned in the \u2018Introduction\u2019 section, the virus replication appears to be exquisitely sensitive to changes in frameshift efficiency. Given the detrimental effect of such changes, the virus likely uses various strategies to counteract this effect. One strategy is inhibition of PKR (reviewed in 25,47) to stimulate translation initiation. HIV-1 uses two major ways to inhibit PKR: its Tat protein inhibits PKR and its TAR RNA structure blocks PKR dimerization when present in large quantities. TAR is located at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of all HIV-1 mRNAs and is also present under a free cytoplasmic form of 58-66 nt (17,18). All these forms of TAR can participate in the inhibition of PKR.",

Indeed, the HIV-1 Vpr protein is capable of inducing G2 arrest in cultured CD4+ T cells (48,49 and references therein), and, during such arrest, cap-dependent translation initiation is severely impaired (50). Another possible strategy to circumvent the problem caused by this situation is the use of a cap-independent mechanism by HIV-1 to initiate the translation of its full-length mRNA (25,45). The virus would thus continue to express Gag and Gag-Pol and would maintain a frameshift efficiency that is optimal for its replication. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was identified in the 5\u2032UTR region of HIV-1 full-length mRNA (51) and another IRES was found in the beginning of the gag coding sequence (52). IRES have also been found in HIV type 2 (53) and in simian immunodeficiency virus (54), two viruses related to HIV-1. However, the use of an IRES by HIV-1 in the context of replication-competent viruses remains to be proven (45). The two strategies that are described above are not mutually exclusive. HIV-1 could first counteract changes in cap-dependent translation initiation by inhibiting PKR, until a larger stress in the cellular environment severely perturbs cap-dependent initiation. The virus would then switch to an IRES-driven mode to translate its full-length mRNA.",

(A) Major control steps of cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes (15). The figure is adapted from Gebauer and Hentze (14). Only the factors we refer to in the text are named. The 40S ribosomal subunit associates with the ternary complex [initiation factor 2 (eIF2) plus GTP plus the initiator tRNA, Met-tRNAiMet] and with other factors, and binds to the 5\u2032 cap structure of the mRNA. This binding requires the eIF4F complex formed by three initiation factors: eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, eIF4G, a scaffold protein and eIF4A, a RNA helicase that unfolds secondary structures. After each round of initiation, eIF2 is released from the ribosome in association with GDP. Phosphorylation of the \u03b1 subunit of eIF2 (eIF2-\u03b1) prevents the recycling of eIF2-GDP in eIF2-GTP, blocking translation initiation. Thapsigargin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which stimulates the PERK kinase that phosphorylates eIF2-\u03b1, reducing the level of functional eIF2 (55\u201357). Rapamycin shuts down the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which blocks the phosphorylation of the translation repressor 4E-BP, and hypophosphorylated 4E-BP sequesters the initiation factor eIF4E (58,59). Hippuristanol is a selective inhibitor of eIF4A (60), which interferes with the binding of the 40S subunit to the mRNA. (B) Plasmid pDual-HIV contains the Rluc and the Fluc coding sequences under the control of a CMV promoter and separated by the HIV-1 frameshift region. (C) The frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from Jurkat cells transfected with 2 \u03bcg of pDual-HIV(-1) or (0) and, subsequently, treated with thapsigargin, rapamycin or hippuristanol or left untreated (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for details).
