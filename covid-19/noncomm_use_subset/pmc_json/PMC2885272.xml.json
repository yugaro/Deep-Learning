Already there have been many proposals to compare genomes. Boore and Brown1 used gene order to study the evolutionary relationships of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Snel et al.2 later constructed the phylogenetic tree for completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on gene content. In Snel et al.'s method, the similarity between two genomes is defined as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of genes. However, such techniques are time-consuming as they must first identify all the genes in one genome. These approaches, together with G + C content, edit distance, and reversal and rearrangement distances,3\u20135 compare genomes using only partial genomic information. Thus, these results are usually controversial because single-gene sequences generally do not contain enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms.",

This sentence enlightened us to get a novel idea of comparing genomes. We can construct a genome space. In this space, each point corresponds to a genome uniquely. The natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes. Currently, there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological information.",

The graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting, and comparing various gene structures. Thus, it is an attractive and promising research direction. The first important method in this direction is due to Hamori.7 He used a three-dimensional curve to represent a DNA sequence. Gates8 later constructed a two-dimensional graphical representation that is simpler than the Hamori curve. However, Gates' graphical representation has high degeneracy. Recently, we reported a new two-dimensional graphical representation of gene sequences9 which has no circuit or degeneracy, so that the correspondence between gene sequences and gene graphs is one-to-one. In this way, the original DNA sequence can be recovered from its graph mathematically without loss of biological information. In this paper, we make a minor modification of our previous method and obtain a new graphical representation approach for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method, and we can prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. The novelty and uniqueness of our approach is that by using these moment vectors of DNA sequences, we have constructed a genome space as a subspace in Euclidean space. Each genome sequence can be represented as a point in this space. Therefore, this genome space can be used to make comparative analysis to study the clustering and phylogenetic relationship among genomes. The biological (evolutionary) distance between two genomes can be obtained through the Euclidean distance among the corresponding points in the genome space.",

Mitochondrial DNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, thus it is very useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of organisms.22 We extracted 35 complete mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences from the GenBank, each of which has length of more than 16 000 nucleotides. Moreover, they have double-stranded and circular structures. As mentioned in the previous section, because we have already known the gene content of both strands of these genomes, we just treat them as the single-stranded (by using the heavy strand) circular genomes. For this case, we treat every point as the start point in this circular sequence of length n, and then we get n linear single-strand genomes. For every linear single-strand genome sequence, by using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1, we can compute its n-dimensional moment vector. Then, we take average by n for these n n-dimensional moment vectors to get a normalized moment vector (M1, M2, \u2026 , Mn). Here, we use the first 60 components of the moment vector (M1, M2, \u2026 , M60) to characterize these 35 genome graphical curves and obtained 35 points in 60-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distances between these points, we got the distance matrix for these 35 organisms. The phylogenetic tree for them shown in Fig. 3 is generated using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package.23 The last 10 mammals are grouped into a cluster because they are primates, and the phylogenetic relationship among them coincides with those found by Raina et al.24 We also found that Norway rat, vole, and squirrel are grouped into a cluster for the reason that they are rodent species.",

HIV is a lentivirus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. To develop the anti-HIV drugs and vaccines, the research into the origins and evolution of this virus has become very important. Rambaut et al.25 reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of the primate lentiviruses including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It was discovered that the two human viruses are related to different SIVs and therefore have different evolutionary origins. However, in Rambaut et al.'s paper, the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of polymerase gene in these lentiviruses. Generally, a single-gene sequence does not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms, thus we use our new method to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome sequences.",

In fact, these RNA genome sequences downloaded from GenBank have already been transformed into DNA sequences (change U by T). Thus, we treat them as linear DNA sequences. Using the nucleotide vector system shown in Fig. 1, the sequence graphs of the genomes of the 33 lentiviruses were obtained. Here, we use the first 12 components of the moment vector to characterize these 33 genome graphical curves, and thus we obtained 33 twelve-dimensional vectors. These 33 vectors can be viewed as 33 points in a 12-dimensional genome space. By computing the Euclidean distance between these points, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of these primate lentiviruses (Fig. 4) using UPGMA program in the MEGA 4 package.23 The figure illustrates that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 lineages fall within that of the SIVs which are isolated from other primates, thus they represent the independent cross-species transmission events. In agreement with Rambaut et al.'s result, our phylogenetic tree shows that HIV-1 group N is a new HIV-1 type between the HIV-1 groups M and O (somewhat closer to the M group). It also indicates that HIV-1 groups M, N, and O are closely related to SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) because there is a mixing of the HIV-1 and SIV lineages. Moreover, our result suggests that P. t. troglodytes (SIVcpz2 and SIVcpz3 in Fig. 4) is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 group O, which is not clear in Rambaut et al.'s evolutionary tree. In Rambaut et al.'s evolutionary tree, the position of HIV-1 group O is just between P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii, but not closer to either of them. Our suggestion coincides with those found by Gao et al.26 In Gao et al.'s work, the authors concluded that the HIV-1 group O is closely related to the just one of these SIVcpz lineages, found in P. t. troglodytes. For HIV-2, we find that the SIVs that are closely related to HIV-2 are not only SIVsm (sooty mangabey monkey) and SIVmac (macaque) as shown by Rambaut et al.'s tree, but also SIVsun (sun-tailed monkey).",

This result is the same as the identification by van der Hoek et al.27 Our two-dimensional genome space reveals that for human SARS-CoV, the most closely related coronavirus is from a small infected mammal, the palm civet (not a bird as initially suspected). This result coincides with those found by Guan et al.28 and Wang et al.29 In Guan et al.'s work, the authors also suggested that SARS viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China. Similarly, in Wang et al.'s work, the researchers found six palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus. They think that SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.",

Here, we should emphasize that we do not need to calculate all the moments to determine the biological information of genomes. Remember that in the central limit theorem in probability and statistics, the limiting process is Gaussian. For Gaussian, the first two moments determine the density function. Thus, we just use the first N moments to get the results, where N is much less than n (the length of genome). Thus, for coronavirus genomes, we only used the first two components of the moment vector (M1, M2) because these two moments have allowed us to obtain the stable classified result\u2014when higher moments are included the relationship of being close or farther away remains unchanged.

            "text": "Gene rearrangements play important roles in evolution. The order of genes and transcription regions are changed during evolution by gene rearrangements such as DNA inversions and transpositions,31 which do not affect the gene content of the chromosomes. For example, inversions of large genomic fragments are often observed even between closely related species. The phylogenetic analysis based on the gene order is challenging as it requires detailed complex gene order data in genomes and intensive computation. In order to test whether our genome space is stable for genomic rearrangement, we consider the following simulated experiment. We choose the human mitochondrion genome and then invert its two genes ATPase 6 and Cytochrome oxidase III to get a simulated genome, which we called human AC genome. We can treat this new genome as the result of the inversion of genes from the human mitochondrion genome. Next, we randomly generate a genome sequence which has the same length and nucleotide content as the human mitochondrion genome, which we called random genome. Thus, we have three genomes of the same length and nucleotide content: human, human AC, and random. In addition, we also choose the common chimpanzee mitochondrion genome as comparison. By using the 60-dimmensional genome space, we calculate the distance among these four genomes and get a distance matrix in Table 2. In Table 2, we found that the distance between human and human AC is very small. This means that even some genomic rearrangement happened in a genome, the new produced genome still has very close distance from the original genome. Thus, in our genome space, the original genome and its genomic rearrangement genome represent different points but have very close distance. Large-scale genomic rearrangements in closely related organisms make the genome sequences very different from the original genome sequences. Although the moment vectors of the original and rearranged DNA sequences are different, if we treat double DNA genomes as two single-stranded genomes to get two n-dimensional moment vectors for these two single-stranded sequences and take the average to get a general moment vector (M1, M2, \u2026 , Mn), the computed distances among related species by gene rearrangements will be small. The genome spaces constructed by the moment vector have advantages over the gene order phylogenetic analysis since the genome spaces do not depend on gene orders and are capable of using all gene families. We will apply the moment vector method on the detailed phylogenetic analysis using the large-scale genomic rearrangement data.\n",

There is no need to reconstruct the genome space for any subsequent application, whereas in multiple alignment methods, realignment is needed for add-on new sequences. (ii) One can have global comparison of all genomes simultaneously, which no other existing method can achieve. Furthermore, in our method, the results in two-dimensional genome space can be displayed and viewed graphically; this is user-friendly and allows even non-expert to understand the relationship among different genomes via viewing the graph of genome space.",

Because the genome lengths of these four species are similar (around 17 000 nt), the X-values of the end points of their graphical curves are very similar.
