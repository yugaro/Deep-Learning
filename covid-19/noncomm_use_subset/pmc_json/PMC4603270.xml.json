Over the past decade, attempts to control deadly zoonotic viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, have been, out of necessity, almost entirely reactionary. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which is not yet contained, and the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea, highlight the rapidity with which these deadly infections can spread. While detection of Ebola was relatively slow in West Africa and response even slower, MERS in South Korea was identified quickly. Yet cases in South Korea ballooned to 164 within 30 days with 24 deaths1 despite a lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Both epidemics share underlying super-spreader mechanisms of transmission attributable directly to cultural practices that were not immediately considered or addressed.",

These elements are essential in efforts to control and prevent emerging infectious disease transmission.

It is the norm for patients to consult several specialists prior to deciding on a first-choice facility.10 This cultural practice led to the contamination of several medical facilities, which in turn led to an unprecedented MERS outbreak in Asia. Clearly \u2018doctor shopping\u2019, (along with the strict implementation of universal precautions and infection control), is a target for policy change and strategic intervention. However, given that the practice is an open secret and is economically feasible, behavior change communications advising the public to stop doctor shopping are unlikely to be successful, even in the face of a fatal epidemic. The burial example in West Africa provides the strongest evidence that people will not automatically change behavior just because the public health community provides evidence that a behavior carries significant personal risk of illness and death. Without understanding the social and cultural philosophy that underlies the practice (e.g., insecurity in the ability to evaluate a physician) it will be impossible to identify the barriers to change that clearly exist, and equally impossible to develop serious and acceptable alternatives.",

Unlike other surveillance approaches, behavioral surveillance does not need to be frequently implemented, since behavior is notoriously resistant to change. To be effective as a prevention tool, behavioral surveillance should be a key component in a comprehensive infectious disease monitoring approach, implemented with high-risk populations in settings at increased risk of zoonotic transmission.2 Should an outbreak occur, a database that documents the social dynamics and behaviors essential to understanding transmission, as well as potential barriers and opportunities for intervention, could contribute to a rapid and feasible disease control and mitigation strategy. In addition, in order to facilitate impact evaluation, it is essential to conduct behavioral surveillance prior to the implementation of any policy or strategic intervention meant to prevent zoonotic disease spillover or outbreaks from occurring.
