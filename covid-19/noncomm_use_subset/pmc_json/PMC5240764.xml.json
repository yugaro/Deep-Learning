It has gained\nattention recently, because many viruses have been discovered and co-infections with\nmultiple pathogens are often fatal. Thus, the development of diagnostic tools for\nCIRDC-associated virus detection is necessary to enhance the diagnosis coverage. In this\nstudy, multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR for the detection of CIRDC-associated RNA and DNA\nviruses, respectively, were developed and compared with conventional methods. Both developed\nmultiplex PCRs could detect several viruses associated with CIRDC efficiently. The two\nmultiplex PCRs gave similar results equivalent to that obtained from the conventional\nsimplex PCRs that could only detect one pathogen per reaction and so required six separate\nreactions per sample. Nested amplification was performed for CRCoV detection in order to\nincrease the sensitivity of detection (Poovorawan, personal communication). Although\nmultiplex PCR has been developed previously to detect several pathogens of CIRDC, such as\nCIV, CDV and CRCoV [10], its application remained\nlimited because of the narrow range of viruses covered, with other CIRDC-associated viruses\nbeing neither detected nor ruled out. Thus, our study might provide a novel platform for\nwhole CIRDC-virus detection.",

            "text": "The overall sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR was more than 90% and\n87%, respectively, compared to their simplex counterparts. However, the detection of CRCoV\nwas modified as a hemi-nested RT-PCR to increase its sensitivity. The false negative\nreactions when performing multiplex PCRs in this study might be resulted from the selection\nof the single optimized Ta for several primer pairs and the low amount of particular target\ngenes [1]. These suggested for the decreased\nsensitivity of the developed multiplex PCRs. Moreover, there was 100% specificity in both\nmodalities for clinical sample detection. Thus, these platforms could likely be used\neffectively in practice. Recently, some multiplex PCR assays were developed in order to\ndetect the CIRDC pathogens [10]; however, the test\nmight be immature, because only CIV, CDV and CRCoV could be detected but not for others.\nThus, our study expanded the coverage of CIRDC virus detection. In an evaluation of the\ncommercially available three-antigen rapid test kit (CAdV-2, CIV and CDV), we found only CIV\ndetection showed an unexpected sensitivity and specificity. A previous study reported that\nthe developed multiplex RT-PCR for H3N2 CIV, CDV and CRCoV detection had an almost 100%\nsensitivity and specificity compared with the conventional RT-PCR and rapid antigen test kit\n[10]. In contrast, our study showed that the\nCIV-positive samples by multiplex RT-PCR were negative when tested with the rapid antigen\ntest kit. This is consistent with reports that many rapid test kits might have a low\nsensitivity to detect the influenza virus, but could still be suitable for rapid in-house\nclinical applications [11, 15]. This reflects that the type of kit, viral copy number, duration of\nstorage, route of sample collection, and type or virus strain may all influence the test\nresults [19]. Interestingly, in this study, about 70%\n(71/102) of samples from the clinical respiratory illness dogs were found to have multiple\ninfections. This finding supports that symptomatically, the CIRDC is a complex disease,\nwhich is mostly caused by co-infection with more than one pathogen. Recently, Jeoung\net al. (2013) used both NS and whole blood samples for CIRDC virus\ndetection, but found that only CDV (and not CIV and CRCoV) could be detected from the whole\nblood samples [10]. Correspondingly, respiratory\nswabs have been reported to be appropriate samples for the detection of respiratory\npathogens [9, 16]. Thus, NS and OS served as appropriate sample sources in our study due to\ntheir ease of and non-invasive sampling nature and that they lie on the viral shedding\nroutes. This study also suggested that the virus should be screened for in NS and OS, with\ndetection levels at each site depending on the type of virus. The CAdV-2 and CaHV-1 mostly\nreplicate in the lower respiratory tracts and shed via respiratory discharge, consisting\nwith our finding that they were mostly detected in the OS, even though NS could often detect\nthese viruses as well. However, the CAdV-2 primer pair used in this study was able to\namplify CAdV-1 DNA virus which also shows airborne transmission and replicates in tonsil\n[3]. Therefore, the positive PCR reaction for canine\nadenovirus could not discriminate between CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in this study. Additionally,\nCaHV-1 can be latent in various nerve ganglions, resulting in negative results from nucleic\nacid-based CaHV-1 detection in respiratory discharges in non-symptomatic dogs [12].",
