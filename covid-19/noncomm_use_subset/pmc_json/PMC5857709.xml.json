Following the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003,14 and the ongoing transmission of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Southeast Asia15 16 and China,17 WHO urged governments to develop pandemic preparedness plans18 as it revised the International Health Regulations in 2005.19 Details vary between countries,20 21 and the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009 demonstrated clearly that willingness to respond also varied substantially between countries, with several Asian countries adopting more aggressive response policies22\u201324 than the approach common in America and Europe, which could be described as being more proportionate to the severity of the epidemics that came to pass.",

This gap is especially noteworthy due to the considerable personal burden imposed by some interventions and the backlash against what some deemed excessive measures during the 2009 influenza pandemic.25 30\n",

Specifically, we assess three broad questions: (i) How informed are the public about infectious disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of different interventions? (ii) How much do the public support interventions\u2014quarantine, isolation of contacts, school closure and mass screening\u2014that restrict civil liberties in an outbreak? (iii) How consistent are overall preferences for intervention policies throughout the population? Are there subgroups whose preferences are in opposition to the majority? We hypothesised that the population would be broadly supportive of interventions that restricted their civil liberties, but that they might be averse to monetary impacts of those interventions. Our work was motivated by the past vulnerability of Singapore to a diversity of emerging infectious disease threats such as Nipah virus in the 1990s31 to SARS-CoV in 2003,32 Chikungunya in 2008,33 pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09) in 200934 and the Zika epidemic in 2016,35 and its perceived vulnerability to future threats, given its location at the centre of Southeast Asia where various highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza continue to spread, its role as a transport hub, its highly urbanised environment and its tropical climate, which permits year round transmission of many viruses.36 These results are hence intended to allow policy makers to identify policies which will have high levels of public support and are hence expected to translate into high levels of compliance, while exemplifying a method that can be used to address the same questions in different settings.",

Each policy scenario consists of a number of attributes (eg, social distancing) and each attribute of a number of levels (eg, none, closure of schools or closure of schools and cancellation of mass gatherings). Each participant was provided a series of 10 pairs of hypothetical alternatives, and for each pair was asked to select one of the two options (with a combination of one level for each attribute) as being his or her preference. An example of a typical pair of options is provided in table 1. Each pair contains the same attributes but different levels of each attribute; the attributes and levels used are found in table 2.",

The Singapore government, during the 2009 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS-CoV outbreaks, quarantined suspected cases and enforced the isolation of actual cases. Both of these measures were included as attributes with two levels for each: mandatory and voluntary. The cancellation of mass gatherings was also included as an attribute with levels ranging from no cancellations to the closure of schools and prohibition of other types of mass gatherings. Temperature screening using thermal scanners was used during both the two events in Singapore and was therefore also included with different levels indicating whether the screenings were to be conducted only at border checkpoints, at checkpoints and other sites within Singapore, or not at all. Finally, a monetary attribute was included which posited a hypothetical one-time tax to fund control efforts with the following values: S$15, S$20, S$40 and S$50 (in 2013 S$1\u2248US$0.80). The two remaining attributes described the outcome of an infectious disease outbreak in terms of two metrics: the expected number of infections (five levels ranging from 200 to 1 000 000 cases) and the expected number of infection-related deaths (five levels; 0\u2013180 deaths). Attributes and levels for the survey were determined through literature review, cognitive interviews and piloting a draft instrument (n=50)39 to span plausible ranges for emerging infectious disease outbreaks or pandemics.",

It is not clear how effective social distancing measures would be in a mild outbreak, however, as many respondents reported that they would not voluntarily reduce how frequently they go out to eat or shop. It may be the implicit recognition of this that made the majority of participants recognise that isolation and quarantine should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Results reveal that the preferences of the population are not uniform; respondents could be broadly categorised into two groupings: one group (mortality averse) was strongly motivated to reduce the number of deaths and willing to accept interventions that did so, whereas another (expenditure averse, 37% of our respondents) was tax averse, and not in favour of any measures that might increase their taxes, even at levels comparable to the per capita costs of Singapore\u2019s routine dengue vector control programme.56\n",

In Singapore, given our findings, this might involve stressing the necessity of such measures to reduce mortality, to co-opt the mortality-averse group, and to minimise the economic impact, to gain support from the sizeable tax-averse group. Studies such as this one can also identify misperceptions among the public that may hinder support for effective control. Two such examples surfaced in our study: (1) temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by our survey participants, although temperature screening at the country\u2019s main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in four in 2009,28 and was increasingly ineffective as the infection became more widespread,57 and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw \u223c 20 000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. Future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences. We included interventions that would be considered for use in response to an emerging infectious disease, and so did not consider vaccination given the lead time needed to develop a vaccine. For many vaccine-preventable infections, however, decisions about whether to be vaccinated are made by the individual, rather than by the government, and so alternative study designs might be better suited to determining features that lead to vaccine uptake and support, such as standard cross-sectional surveys.58 Ethical issues regarding loss of liberty during an outbreak were not covered in our experiment, and should be explored in future studies, together with more contextual information on why policies were favoured or not.59\n",

In addition, information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values. Whereas surveys have been performed retrospectively to gauge support for government responses to specific circumstances like the SARS-CoV outbreaks in 2003 and influenza pandemic in 2009,62 63 our method is the first conjoint analysis that quantifies public support for government interventions over a realistic range of outbreak scenarios and parameters.",

However, at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen\u2019s transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable.
