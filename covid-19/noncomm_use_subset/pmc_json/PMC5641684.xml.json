The prevalence of NAFLD in the general adult population ranges from 25% to 45% and rises with increasing incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes [1]. Patients with NASH reveal augmented mortality rate, whereas NAFL has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes [2]. Current management for NAFLD includes lifestyle modifications, control of metabolic risk factors, and pharmacological therapies. However, since only biopsy-proven NASH patients receive medical treatment [3], there is a need for suitable drugs for the treatment of NAFL.",

            "text": "Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) could serve as target in NAFL therapy. DPP4 is a serine protease that cleaves a variety of substrates including incretin hormones, chemokines, growth factors, and neuropeptides [4]. It is ubiquitously expressed on the apical surface of many cell types and also occurs as a soluble form (sDPP4) in the circulation and other body fluids [5], [6]. There is accumulating evidence that DPP4 is involved in the development of chronic liver disease [5], [7], [8]. DPP4 is highly expressed in the liver, and its expression as well as circulating levels are increased in NAFL and NASH [8], [9], [10]. sDPP4 is suggested as biomarker of NAFLD [11] and was shown to be a valid measure for hepatocyte apoptosis and fibrosis [12]. Genetic ablation of Dpp4 in mice [13] and rats [14] results in improved insulin sensitivity and liver function, and pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 causes reduction of hepatic steatosis and improvement of insulin sensitivity in mouse models of obesity [15], [16] and diabetes [17]. Beside its role in the degradation of incretin hormones, DPP4 was shown to exert incretin-independent functions such as the induction of insulin resistance [18], [19], [20], [21] and inflammation [22] in different cellular systems. However, whether elevated DPP4 and in particular hepatic DPP4 triggers insulin resistance and NAFLD or simply reflects the state of liver disease is not entirely clarified. We recently demonstrated in diet-induced obesity mice that expression and release of DPP4 is substantially increased in liver when compared to adipose depots [23]. We further showed that elevated expression of Dpp4 in livers of 6-week-old mice associates with early insulin resistance, which, in turn, triggers later liver steatosis [23]. In the current study, we analyzed the DPP4 activity in plasma of healthy and NAFLD subjects and elucidated the effect of hepatocyte-specific Dpp4 overexpression on the development of insulin resistance and liver steatosis in mice under obese conditions.",

Venous blood samples were obtained at time points 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for the measurement of glucose (ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Analyzer, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) and insulin (ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Insulin sensitivity was calculated with the composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) [25]. Liver fat was quantified by localized 1H-MR spectroscopy using a 1.5 T MR scanner (Magnetom Sonata, Siemens Healthcare). The cohort was divided into quartiles according to liver fat content. For quantification of plasma DPP4 activity, 158 samples from subjects of the first and fourth quartile, matched for age and sex, were used. DPP4 activity was measured in 25 \u03bcl plasma as described before [23].

Male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and Dpp4-transgenic (Dpp4-Liv-Tg) mice received a HFD (45 kcal% from fat) for 27 weeks and were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. Both Dpp4 mRNA and protein contents were significantly increased (2.2-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively) in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice but not altered in adipose depots or skeletal muscle (Figure 2A,B). Primary hepatocytes isolated from Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice also showed elevated DPP4 protein content and cellular DPP4 activity than those isolated from WT animals (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 1A,B). Moreover, comparing endogenous DPP4 levels in different metabolic tissues of WT mice reveal the highest expression of DPP4 in the liver (Figure 2A,B). Immunohistochemical staining of DPP4 in liver sections suggests increased membrane localization in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice indicated by a co-staining with the plasma membrane marker E-cadherin (Figure 2C). As transmembrane bound DPP4 can be shed from hepatocytes [23], we studied the capacity of DPP4 release by analyzing plasma DPP4 activity in WT and Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice. Dpp4-Liv-Tg animals exhibited a 2-fold increase in plasma DPP4 activity, demonstrating an elevated release of DPP4 from livers of these mice (Figure 2D). In addition, cell supernatants of primary hepatocytes from Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice showed higher DPP4 concentration and activity than those from WT controls (Supplementary Figure 1C,D).",

At a young age (6 weeks), both WT and Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice showed a low liver fat content of about 1.5% (Figure 4A). However, after 15 weeks of HFD feeding hepatic fat content raised to 4.2 \u00b1 1.0% in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice, whereas liver fat content in WT mice was unchanged (1.8 \u00b1 0.2%) (Figure 4A). After additional 8 weeks on the diet, liver fat content reached 6.4 \u00b1 1.6% in Dpp4-Liv-Tg and 3.1 \u00b1 0.4% in WT mice (p < 0.01) (Figure 4A), indicating a slow but direct effect of hepatic DPP4 levels on liver steatosis. At 30 weeks of age, liver glycogen and liver cholesterol were not significantly different, whereas levels of triglycerides were higher in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (Figure 4B). As a consequence, liver weight showed a tendency to be higher than of WT mice (Figure 4 B). Histological examinations confirmed the increased accumulation of ectopic fat (Figure 4C,D) and larger lipid droplets, indicated by staining of the lipid droplet coating protein perilipin 2 in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (Figure 4E). Plasma analysis of markers for liver damage showed significantly elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT, p < 0.05) and numerical increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT, p = 0.171) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, p = 0.132) levels (Table 1). However, markers for inflammation and fibrosis were similar in livers of WT and Dpp4-Liv-Tg animals (Supplementary Figure 2). Taken together, elevated levels of DPP4 in the liver cause hepatic steatosis with indications of liver damage but not inflammation and fibrosis in mice on a HFD.",

Microarray analysis revealed that 105 genes were up- and 60 genes downregulated in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (log2-fold change |>0.50|, p < 0.05). Focusing on genes involved in lipid metabolism, we detected no changes in genes of triglyceride hydrolysis, de novo lipogenesis (except Srebf1), and only slightly elevated mRNA levels of Cpt1a, Apob, and Dgat2 in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (Supplementary Figure 3). The most striking effect was observed for the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Ppar\u03b3) and its downstream target fatty acid translocase (Cd36), which were both significantly increased in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (2.2-fold and 2.3-fold, Supplementary Figure 3). Monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1), another target gene of hepatocyte PPAR\u03b3, also tended to be higher in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice (Supplementary Figure 3). Validation using quantitative real-time PCR confirmed a significantly elevated expression of Ppar\u03b3 and Cd36 and a trend towards higher Mogat1 levels in transgenic animals (Figure 5A). In agreement, western blot analysis showed higher PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 protein levels in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg animals (Figure 5B). Interestingly, only PPAR\u03b3 isoform 1 was upregulated in these samples, suggesting an isoform-specific effect of DPP4 on PPAR\u03b3 expression. In summary, DPP4-induced liver steatosis associates with elevated hepatic PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 expression.",

As studies on primary human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells discovered direct effects of soluble DPP4 on the insulin sensitivity of these cells [18], we tested whether elevated DPP4 levels also affect hepatic insulin sensitivity. Human HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of recombinant human DPP4 (rhDPP4) and analyzed for their insulin responsiveness. Insulin-stimulated Akt-phosphorylation was unaffected with low dose of rhDPP4 (75\u2013150 ng/ml) but completely blunted with a dosage of 300\u2013500 ng/ml (Figure 6A). Also, in primary murine hepatocytes obtained from 12-week-old lean WT mice, 500 ng/ml recombinant mouse DPP4 (rmDPP4) reduced the insulin-stimulated Akt-phosphorylation by 15% (Figure 6B). Moreover, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of full-length Dpp4 (Ad-Dpp4) [23] in primary hepatocytes led to a reduction of insulin sensitivity by 30%, when compared to Ad-Gfp infected control cells (Figure 6C). Primary hepatocytes obtained from 12-week-old standard diet fed WT and Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice did not differ in lipid content (data not shown) but revealed differences in insulin responsiveness, as hepatocytes from Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice showed an 18% lower Akt-phosphorylation than those of WT controls (Figure 6D). Taken together, soluble DPP4 reduced the insulin sensitivity of human and mouse liver cells, suggesting a direct role of DPP4 in hepatic insulin signaling.",

However, it was not clear whether elevated DPP4 levels in the liver are causal for the later onset of NAFLD. Here, we show for the first time that the overexpression of Dpp4 in hepatocytes of HFD fed C57BL/6J mice promotes the development of fatty liver. Thus, dysregulation of Dpp4 expression by e.g. epigenetic mechanisms [23] can lead to perturbations in hepatic metabolism and finally to elevated ectopic lipid accumulation in the long-term. Although we show increased hepatic steatosis as a consequence of Dpp4 overexpression, our data indicate that the elevated hepatic lipid accumulation in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice is a secondary effect of alterations in (i) hepatic insulin sensitivity and (ii) energy homeostasis via interference in the incretin axis.",

The fact that human HepG2 cells and murine primary hepatocytes showed impaired insulin sensitivity in response to DPP4 leads to the conclusion that DPP4 has a direct incretin-independent effect on hepatic insulin signaling. Insulin-stimulated Akt-phosphorylation was blunted by the treatment with recombinant DPP4 as well as by adenoviral and transgenic overexpression of Dpp4. Importantly, dose of recombinant protein inducing insulin resistance (500 ng/ml) was in a physiological range found in serum of obese and insulin resistant subjects [18], [19]. The observed effects on insulin sensitivity were independent of the lipid content, excluding lipotoxicity-induced insulin resistance. This is in line with recently published data showing improved insulin sensitivity and lower fat content in HepG2 cells after siRNA-mediated suppression of DPP4\n[32]. Furthermore, studies in primary human adipocytes showed insulin resistance by the administration of recombinant DPP4 [18] and improved insulin sensitivity when DPP4 was downregulated [20]. Moreover, long-term DPP4 inhibition improved insulin sensitivity and reduced liver fat content in animals with diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance [16], [33]. Thus, DPP4 has an autocrine effect on hepatic insulin signaling which might contribute to later accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver.",

Here we show that Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice exhibited lower levels of active GLP-1 in the periphery, whereas portal vein concentrations were not affected. This clearly demonstrates that despite normal secretion from intestinal L-cells, hepatic Dpp4 overexpression leads to a substantial reduction of active GLP-1 after liver passage, suggesting hepatic DPP4 as a major contributor in the degradation of postprandial GLP-1. Since hepatic DPP4 expression is usually confined to the bile canalicular domain, it is unlikely that DPP4 reaches the bloodstream to degrade GLP-1. However, under conditions of liver damage polarity of the cells can change leading to the release of DPP4 into interstitial fluids as described before [34]. Thus, increased plasma DPP4 activity in Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice seems not to be solely the result of elevated expression but also of changes in cell polarity as supposed from histological examinations (Figure 2C).",

In contrast, Dpp4-knockout rats reveal lower serum AST and ALT after 2 months on a Western diet [14], and Dpp4-deficient mice display less liver fibrosis and inflammation in an experimental model of liver injury [36]. Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific Dpp4 overexpression resulted in significant higher levels of GGT and numerical increased AST and ALT concentrations, providing further evidence for a direct connection between hepatic DPP4 and liver damage. The observed hypercholesterolemia of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice is in line with previous studies, showing increased cholesterol levels in human subjects with elevated hepatic DPP4\n[9], and reduced plasma cholesterol levels in Dpp4-deficient rats [14].",

            "text": "The elevated triglyceride content in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice appears to be the consequence of augmented levels of PPAR\u03b3 and CD36, both being implicated in liver steatosis. Similarly, exogenous DPP4 increases lipid accumulation and PPAR\u03b3 expression in pre-adipocytes [37], and activation of DPP4 on the surface of macrophages by middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) induces PPAR\u03b3 expression [38]. On the other hand, DPP4 was identified as PPAR\u03b3 target gene in cells derived from human placental tissue [39]. The mechanism of DPP4-mediated PPAR\u03b3 induction is still unclear, whereas effects of increased hepatic PPAR\u03b3 are well understood. Hepatocyte-specific expression of PPAR\u03b3 is associated with fatty liver in human [40] and mice [41], [42], and hepatic overexpression of PPAR\u03b3 induces liver steatosis [43], whereas PPAR\u03b3-knockout reduces hepatic fat content in mice on a HFD [44]. The major targets of PPAR\u03b3 in the liver are fatty acid (Cd36) and monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1), both being implicated in fatty liver disease [45], and upregulated in livers of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice. Thus, high PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 levels in Dpp4-Liv-Tg livers seem to contribute to elevated levels of hepatic steatosis.",

It has been shown that soluble DPP4 induces inflammation in human smooth muscle cells via MAPK and NF\u03baB-mediated pathways [22], and a study in primary human adipocytes revealed suppression of TNF\u03b1-induced IL6 secretion after genetic silencing of DPP4\n[20]. Moreover, it was suggested that DPP4 enhances inflammatory actions by upregulating toll-like receptors (TLRs) in kidney and adipose tissue, while DPP4 inhibition has anti-inflammatory effects [48]. The present data demonstrate an increased expression of macrophage markers and proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice, despite no effects on adipose Dpp4 expression. Since elevated activity of circulating DPP4 is of hepatic origin, it is likely that hepatic DPP4 contributes to the induction of adipose inflammation via PAR2- and TLR-mediated pathways.",
