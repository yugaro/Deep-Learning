Since then, the HIV epidemic has been concentrated in most at-risk populations (MARPs), including injection drug users (IDUs), commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM) and former plasma donors who became infected because of unsafe donation practices. Although the overall HIV prevalence in China is only \u223c0.05%, in some geographic areas HIV prevalence is >1% in the general population. With such great differences, interventions must be targeted to the local situation and population of concern. Since 1988, international cooperation projects have been an important part of China\u2019s HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. The strategies and experiences of these international cooperation projects are gradually being integrated into China\u2019s national HIV/AIDS prevention and control work, while still adapting to the situation at the local level. In this way, an HIV/AIDS prevention model unique to China is being formed, which in turn is having a positive impact on HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts among the international community.",

The first large international project was one million USD from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) for training in Yunnan province. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the European Union (EU), the Australian Red Cross, and other international organizations and international NGOs had activities focusing on HIV/AIDS monitoring, advocacy and training in 12 cities. The programmes also supported media campaigns on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Exploratory work was carried out in the area of stigma and discrimination reduction. For example, UNICEF supported the \u2018Unite For youth, Unite Against AIDS\u2019 global campaign, in which a couple of young students were chosen to be the youth ambassadors to join activities for promoting AIDS awareness in universities.",

This stage saw advancement in the development of HIV/AIDS prevention, control and care models, and provided a foundation for the establishment of HIV/AIDS policies. As China\u2019s HIV/AIDS epidemic became localized in high-prevalence areas, China\u2019s comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention and control work expanded significantly. The World Bank (WB) supported the Health IX project in China for HIV testing and screening laboratory network capacity construction. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the China\u2013UK AIDS project funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) focused on interventions among high-risk groups were also introduced to China during this period. The US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) Global AIDS Program (GAP) works closely with NCAIDS on surveillance, laboratory methods, interventions for hard-to-reach populations and improving HIV care and treatment (Programme Summary can be found at the website: http://www.uscdc.cn/en/content.jsp?classid=14&articleid=28). The programme plays a significant role in improving the effectiveness of national and provincial programmes and piloting innovative methods. The China\u2013Australia AIDS Project, funded by AusAID, advocates for harm reduction strategies has greatly influenced China\u2019s policy towards harm reduction. The China\u2013Germany Program provided continuous support on laboratory equipment, training, technical assistance and infrastructure construction. The China\u2013Sweden program provided financial support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) to help support the Chinese government to achieve the goal of reducing HIV secondary transmission.",

These strategies have been employed in several areas, including using surveillance to promote testing and early diagnosis of HIV infection, increasing universal access to AIDS care and treatment and preventing second-generation HIV transmission, among others. These activities have significantly accelerated the improvement of China\u2019s HIV/AIDS surveillance strategy from passive surveillance to active case finding combined with case management. In 2000, China initiated a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) pilot programme with the support of the WHO, the UNFPA and the China\u2013UK programme. Based on the experiences of the pilot programme, VCT became a national strategy in 2004 and was expanded to 7335 sites by December 2009. The surveillance strategy has also changed from sero-surveillance to behavioural surveillance, and later to comprehensive surveillance, which is the combination of the serology and the behavioural surveillance. The development of surveillance system impacts the determination of AIDS policy and the use of HIV/AIDS resource.12\u201314 UNAIDS and WHO have recommended a series of intervention measures for high-risk populations including VCT, health education, condom promotion and social marketing, methadone maintenance treatment and needle exchange. In 2001, with the cooperation of WHO, China launched a condom promotion project in Hubei, Jiangsu, Hunan and Hainan provinces. In Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, the China\u2013UK program also began to explore intervention models among commercial sex workers and condom social marketing. These projects proved to be useful in the Chinese context. Several interventions, including condom promotion, STD clinic-based outreach and intervention among low-fee sex workers and clients, have all been developed and are still improving. These methods have been adopted as national guidelines for HIV/AIDS control and were scaled-up throughout the country. Experiences accumulated in these projects have been very helpful to explore appropriate intervention models for high-risk populations in China. These experiences have established a base for the generalization of best practices and have informed strategies at the national level. For example, condom promotion was adopted in the national HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Regulation in 2006.",

These agencies have in turn adopted policies emphasizing transparency and the open sharing of data. To some extent, the involvement of international cooperation makes the various levels of government more serious about HIV prevention and pushes to improve the social environment surrounding HIV/AIDS. Advocacy for policy change and the development of strategic plans are a major task in the early stage of most international cooperation projects. Through a series of activities, including training, investigations, study sessions and workshops involving government officials and policy-makers from multiple sectors, an enabling environment has been created promoting cooperation between multiple sectors. This provides strong support for national leadership development and policy advocacy. China\u2019s HIV/AIDS comprehensive response mechanism, which is a government-led, multi-sector cooperation and involves participation of the whole society, was created one step at a time. Top national leaders have visited AIDS patients, supervised HIV prevention work and encouraged health workers during the annual World AIDS Day activities. This has set a good example for the whole society to follow. Supported by these programmes, the State Council AIDS Working Committee Office has issued several documents and guidelines such as Mid/Long-Term Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in China (1998\u20132010), China\u2019s Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2001\u201305; 2006\u201310), \u2018Four Frees and One Care\u2019 AIDS policy, State Council Notice on Strengthening HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Work and various technical guidance documents and practical suggestions on promoting condom use and community-based methadone maintenance treatment, among others. The issue of these documents has improved the social environment of AIDS control in China.16,17",

Technical documents, developed by different projects, have proven helpful to local health workers in mounting a rapid response to emergencies as well as in improving problem-solving capabilities and technical standardization. Some international cooperation projects have organized training sessions, workshops and study tours to improve abilities in project management, specialized knowledge and research methods. International cooperation projects create a team of HIV/AIDS fighters who are not only familiar with advanced international information and technology, but who also have ample field work experience. They have become the main force in fighting AIDS in China. In addition, programmes support applied research in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The results of research provide valuable knowledge and scientific evidence for improving China\u2019s HIV/AIDS prevention and control work.18,19",
