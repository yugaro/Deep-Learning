Protracted bacterial bronchitis is now recognized as one of the most common causes of chronic wet cough, especially in young children under 5 years of age.6,7",

In approaching these clinical entities, our goal was to promptly detect the patients with bacterial sinusitis and the involved pathogens and to treat them with appropriate antibiotics. To this end, we decided to employ a novel method described by Huang and Small,8 who reported that nasal secretion dipstick assay was highly correlated with sinus imaging studies and could be utilized for the diagnosis of sinusitis. We employed this simple approach for obvious reasons: speed, cost-effectiveness, and avoidance of radiation risk associated with sinus imaging studies. We also sought an equally simple and rapid method for identification of the pathogens for the suspected sinusitis. Positive findings in imaging studies of sinuses such as opacities and thickened lining indicate the presence of inflammation, possibly infection, but may have poor correlation with clinical disease9,10 and do not reveal any information on etiologies. Although sinus puncture would yield such information,11 this cannot be performed in most nonsurgical office settings. Studies have documented that nasal culture is a poor reflection of the microbes in the sinus cavity.12 Therefore, we analyzed the microbes from the osteomeatal area utilizing a quantitative PCR method in an attempt to detect the pathogens that may cohabit both sinus and nasal cavities.",

Resistance genes for the following antibiotics were included vancomycin, methicillins, beta-lactams, carbapenems, macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and quinolones.

SP, HI, and MC were classified as PPB since these have been established as predominant pathogens for acute and subacute sinusitis by previous studies.12,24 SE is reported to be a commensal bacterium in the nasal cavity.25 Although CP was characterized as pathogenic in some studies,26 it was reported to be part of natural microbiota of the nares and throat.27 DP has not been reported to cause sinusitis.28 SA was classified separately because of its presence in the nasal and sinus cavities of asymptomatic subjects29\u201331 and patient with sinusitis.32,33\nRhinovirus and Parainfluenza Virus were the only viruses identified and classified as potentially pathogenic viruses (PPV) since it is well known to cause upper respiratory symptoms. As seen in Tables 2 and 3, the presence of PPB as a dominant species in the nasal cavities correlated with the clinical diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis (P < .002) indicating that dominance of microbes over others is an important element of pathogenesis.34 The presence of a PPB in group 1B, 2, and 3 is not surprising because it is known to inhabit the nasal cavities of asymptomatic subjects.17 The nondominance of these PPB along with other clinical features should enable the clinicians to separate these groups from the ones with bacterial sinusitis (1A). Group 1A may represent a combination of recurrent acute, subacute, and chronic sinusitis with bacterial infections. These PPB are also reported to be the most common pathogens associated with acute otitis media33 and protracted bacterial bronchitis.6,7 It is possible that these patients may indeed have simultaneous sinusitis and protracted bacterial bronchitis since antibiotic treatment stops coughing in both entities. Such coexistence (via \u201cone airway\u201d) needs to be explored in the future. In group 1B, chronic cough was most likely due to postnasal drip resulting from nonbacterial pathologies such as allergy (91% of the patients had allergen sensitization as shown in Table 1), viral infection, or chronic irritation. Although SA was present as dominant species in 2 patients in this group, its pathogenic role is doubtful due to their presence in control groups 2 and 3. Staphylococci were present in the sinus aspirates of acute,29 chronic sinusitis,14,20,21 and in the nasal cavities of those with CRS with nasal polyps,16 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis, especially in adults.32,33 But they were also shown to be present in the nasal cavities of 25% to 30% of asymptomatic subjects30 in a competing relationship with PNPB,22 and their presence may be a transient colonization rather than infection.36",

This can be detected by simple methods: dipstick assay and quantitative DNA-PCR test of the nasal secretion. Therefore, we recommend that clinicians utilize these methods as an alternative to imaging studies to make a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis and offer a specific therapy for the pathogens in a rapid and accurate manner. Further studies are indicated to replicate these findings and refine the potential diagnostic capabilities of DNA-based methods for bacterial sinusitis and bronchitis.",
