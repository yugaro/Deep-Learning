We used the 16 October 2017 version of the database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov to identify clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2017. This cohort represents the entirety of clinical trials registered after US legal requirements for registering certain interventional trials available at the time of this study [9]. Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov is a relational database (PostgreSQL) developed and maintained by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative. It contains all information about studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov since its inception in February 2000 and is updated daily with content downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov. The database is publicly available in the cloud, with access information and documentation provided at the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative website [10]. We then focused on interventional trials by filtering the data set using the registry\u2019s \u201cstudy type\u201d field, which identifies studies as interventional, observational, expanded access, or not applicable.",

We previously used this database to characterize the landscape of ID trials, although that analysis was limited to the first 3 years (2007\u20132010) after registration of interventional trials became legally mandatory. Now that a decade of ClinicalTrials.gov data after FDA Amendments Act registration mandates are available, there is an opportunity to reanalyze the ID research landscape.",

For example, there was a strong emphasis on prevention-focused trials. Similarly, the importance of vaccine-based interventions persisted. ID trials also restricted trials to children at a much higher rate than non-ID trials, potentially owing to the focus on prevention and vaccination within the field. This may be due to the greater burden of certain IDs in children. This predilection of IDs for the young partially, but not entirely, explains the higher rate of exclusion for elderly subjects. The exclusion of elderly subjects in the HIV/AIDS, influenza vaccine, tuberculosis, and malaria categories may limit the generalizability of some trials within these categories.",

Consequently, the number of trials in a category is not always a good proxy for the extent of work being done on a particular disease.

Hepatitis C presented a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of clinical trials research as new treatments became available. Predictably, trials progressed from earl-y to late-phase designs as new directly acting antiviral drugs moved through development and validation. Industry funding, the primary source of funding for these and most ID studies, tracked closely with the number of late-phase studies, indicating the large extent to which industry funding was the driving force behind hepatitis C research during this period. The new drug classes took 4\u20136 years to progress through the clinical research pipeline, with the first 2 years focused on early-phase trials. It is worth noting that hepatitis C trials were found to be overrepresented in the ID trial data set compared with global morbidity and mortality rates. Considering that the parallel development of multiple drug interventions was occurring at essentially the same time, it is possible some of the overrepresentation of hepatitis C could have been averted through greater collaboration of industry, funding sources, and researchers. Platform trials, such as the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging And molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) model for breast cancer, could have been an ideal opportunity to streamline evaluation of these various new hepatitis C therapies [23].",

Influenza vaccine trials exhibited a distinct spike in the number of clinical trials in study years 2008 and 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic worldwide [24]. Hemorrhagic virus trials had a distinct spike in 2014\u20132015, corresponding to the 2014\u20132016 Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Western Africa [25]. Interestingly, the first Ebola case was reported in March 2014, just 6 months before the registration of several Ebola clinical trials. This is a relatively short time from the recognition of a need for clinical research, securing funding for that research, and initiation of the clinical trial [25]. A similar trend was observed with Zika trials, which also were registered only in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to the onset of that outbreak [26]. Despite extensive research on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus during 2007\u20132017, there were very few (n = 3) interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov pertaining to these infections. This is probably because the registry and our analysis focuses on interventional trials, whereas many studies of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were observational and were therefore not required to register.",

Along these lines, LRTI trials continued to be underrepresented, constituting only 6.6% of the ID studies registered and 35.8% of infection-related global deaths. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, childhood cluster diseases, and meningitis were also underrepresented compared with global ID morbidity and mortality rates, although these diseases were generally well represented or overrepresented compared with their very low prevalences in the United States.

Second, the FDA requirement for registration applies to interventional trials of FDA-regulated drug and biologic products and devices. Although \u201cintervention\u201d encompasses a wide range of topics, a substantial amount of research, including clinical research, is noninterventional and therefore not captured in this data set [3, 27]. In addition, less common intervention types (eg, dietary and behavioral intervention) may not be captured. Third, ClinicalTrials.gov does not collect information about trial funding. We have attempted to present funding information using previously published algorithms. However, these algorithms make certain assumptions based on study sponsor, which limits some of the conclusions that can be made about funding.
