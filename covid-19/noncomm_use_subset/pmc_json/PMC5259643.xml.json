Clinical presentation is highly variable with a broad spectrum of signs and degrees of severity and its treatment usually represents a challenge. Due to the elevated prevalence of kidney disease in the canine population with leishmaniasis, it is important to consider an effective treatment drug with few renal side effects. Recent data have shown that marbofloxacin has leishmanicidal effects without causing changes in renal parameters of non\u2010azotemic affected dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the effect on renal function of marbofloxacin in dogs with leishmaniasis and concurrent chronic renal disease (CKD). Twenty eight dogs with leishmaniasis and CKD (11 animals in stage 1 and 17 in stage >1; based on IRIS recommendations) and no other coexisting diseases were enrolled in the study. Dogs were treated with oral marbofloxacin at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Physical exam, blood pressure, CBC, serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis (including urine creatine:protein ratio and urinary cystatin C) were recorded at baseline (day 0) and after treatment with marbofloxacin (day 28) to determine the drug effect on renal function. Lymph node aspirations were also taken at days 0 and 28 to quantify the parasitic load by real\u2010time PCR. Values are expressed as mean\u00b1SE. P < 0.05 was considered significant. In the dogs under study the treatment with marbofloxacin was well tolerated with no obvious side effects and the clinical signs related to the disease notably improved. These dogs with impaired renal function evidenced an improvement in some of the CKD biomarkers: a significant decrease in the urinary protein loss (from 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 to 2.9 \u00b1 0.4; P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (from 180.0 \u00b1 6.9 to 170.0 \u00b1 7.3 mmHg; P < 0.05). Moreover, 72% of the dogs showed a significant reduction in parasitic load while in 28% the parasitic load remained stable. In relation to the aforementioned findings, dogs showed a significant increase in plasma albumin concentration (from 15.0 \u00b1 1.0 to 16.6 \u00b1 0.7 g/L; P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in globulin concentration (from 59.0 \u00b1 3.4 to 54.1 \u00b1 3.4 g/L; P < 0.05). No significant changes were found in the other parameters under study. In conclusion and based on these results, marbofloxacin can be chosen as an effective and safe alternative for treatment of dogs with leishmania and concurrent CKD.",

MDR bacteria are being increasingly reported in companion animals, thus raising great concerns for animal and public health. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and to characterize the beta\u2010lactam resistance mechanisms among isolates from cats showing clinical signs of various diseases in Southern Italy. A total of 101 cats affected by several clinical conditions (58.4% diarrhoea, 30.7% upper respiratory tract disease, 3.9% otitis, 2.9% conjunctivitis, 1% abscess, 2% stomatitis, 1% cystitis) were included. Data concerning living conditions and antimicrobial treatment were collected. Bacterial susceptibility testing to n = 8 antimicrobial classes and interpretation were performed according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints. Combination disc test was used for phenotypic identification of ESBLs producers. ESBL and pAmpC genes were identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic groups of MDR Escherichia coli were determined according to Doumith et al. (2012). Among 125 Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli (52%) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. (16%), Proteus spp. (10.4%) and Citrobacter spp. (9.6%). The higher resistance frequencies were found against amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid (64.8%) and third\u2010generation cephalosporines (38.4%\u201040.8%). Although lower, resistance to aztreonam (32%), ciprofloxacin (23.2%), amikacin (31.2%), chloramphenicol (24%) and sulphamethoxazole\u2010thrimetoprim (36.6%) were also significant. All isolates were susceptible to meropenem. Fifty percent of isolates were multidrug\u2010resistant. Twenty\u2010one MDR isolates were confirmed as ESBL\u2010producers, namely: blaCTX\u2010M\u2010group1 (n = 11), \u2010group2 (n = 1) and \u2010group9 (n = 1); blaSHV (n = 1) and blaTEM (n = 7). Eight isolates were pAmpC blaCMY\u2010producers, with five isolates also harbouring blaTEM and blaCTX\u2010M. ESBLs and pAmpC\u2010producing isolates were recovered from n = 19 cats, affected by diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract disease, abscess, otitis, stomatitis and cystitis. Of these, 58% were shelter cats, 42% were household; most (n = 15) were not receiving an antimicrobial treatment at the time of sample collection. ESBL/pAMPC\u2010producing E. coli (n = 11), belonged to phylogenetic groups B2 and D, and were collected from n = 5 diarrheic cats (n = 3 living in shelter, n = 2 household), n = 1 shelter cat with upper respiratory tract disease, n = 1 household cat with cystitis and n = 1 shelter cat with cystitis. This study shows the dissemination of MDR Enterobacteriaceae in a variety of common defined clinical conditions among a feline population from Southern Italy. The emergence of ESBL/pAmpC\u2010producing multidrug\u2010resistant Enterobacteriaceae poses major limitations in companion animals\u2019 therapeutic options. Furthermore, it raises great concerns regarding the bi\u2010directional transmission of MDR bacteria between pets and humans.",

            "text": "Biochemical parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) are often used to make a presumptive diagnosis of liver disease in the dog. Especially in idiopathic and copper\u2010associated forms or chronic hepatitis, there is a long subclinical phase in which dogs do not show clinical signs of liver disease. However, this would be the phase in which therapeutic intervention may be most effective. In dog breeds with a hereditary predisposition for the development of hepatitis, biochemical screening of subclinical dogs may be a valuable tool to identify affected dogs in an early stage. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ALT and AP for detecting hepatocellular injury in clinically healthy Labrador retrievers. Hereto, patient files of 198 client\u2010owned clinically healthy Labrador retrievers were reviewed. Labradors underwent a liver biopsy for screening for copper toxicosis as part of the research program into copper associated hepatitis of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University. Age, sex, liver histopathology results, ALT and AP were recorded. To determine sensitivity and specificity in these dogs, ROC analyses were used. In total, 69 dogs did not show histological abnormalities (controls) and 129 dogs showed hepatocellular injury (including 39 cases with primary hepatitis and 90 cases with reactive hepatopathy). In all 198 dogs, median ALT was 37 U/L (range 5\u2013733) and median AP was 26 U/L (range 8\u20133360). Using thresholds of 70 U/L (ALT) and 89 U/L (AP) which are upper reference values in our laboratory, the sensitivity for detecting hepatocellular injury in clinically healthy dogs was 22% for ALT and 10% for AP. Specificity was 93% and 98% for ALT and AP respectively. New thresholds for ALT and AP were determined using the point closest to the top\u2010left part of the plot with perfect sensitivity or specificity. New thresholds were 35 U/L for ALT and 26 U/L for AP. When using these values sensitivity increased to 68% (ALT) and 59% (AP) and specificity decreased to 62% (ALT) and 60% (AP). Overall, both ALT and AP have a very low sensitivity for detection of hepatocellular injury in Labradors with subclinical liver disease. Decreasing the threshold cut\u2010off to improve the sensitivity results in a substantial decrease in specificity. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed for early detection of subclinically affected dogs, in order to avoid the progression to late stage hepatitis and liver cirrhosis.",

            "text": "Hepatobiliary diseases are commonly encountered in dogs and can be divided into four main categories: parenchymal, biliary, vascular, or neoplastic disorders. In many cases clinical signs of hepatobiliary diseases are non\u2010specific. Current biochemical indicators can establish the presence of hepatobiliary disease, but cannot specify underlying disease and a thorough and extensive diagnostic workup is needed. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been identified as promising new serum biomarkers for hepatobiliary disease in humans and dogs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum levels of an established group of microRNAs can be used to differentiate between various hepatobiliary diseases in dogs. Real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction was used for quantification of 6 microRNAs (miR\u201021, miR\u2010122, miR\u2010126, miR\u2010148a, miR\u2010200c, and miR\u2010222) in serum of 46 dogs with an established diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease compared to 11 healthy dogs. Hepatobiliary diseases included parenchymal (acute/chronic hepatitis), biliary (mucoceles/cholangitis and extra hepatic bile duct obstruction), vascular (congenital portosystemic shunts), and neoplastic (adenomas/carcinomas/malignant lymphomas) subgroups. Linear regression was used to investigate the effect of diagnostic subgroup on the serum levels of the natural logarithm of the different microRNAs, with healthy dogs as reference category. P\u2010values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin\u2010Hochberg correction. With a microRNA panel consisting of miR\u201021, miR\u2010122, miR\u2010126, miR\u2010200c, and miR\u2010222 it was possible to distinguish between parenchymal, biliary, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. Within these groups, a differentiation between all above mentioned subgroups could be made. No differential microRNA expression was found in the adenoma and congenital portosystemic shunt groups. All other subgroups had increased levels of one or more microRNAs. MicroRNA\u2010122 and miR\u201021 were both associated with hepatobiliary disease in general, while miR\u2010126 and miR\u2010200c were uniquely upregulated in chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively. This study shows that serum microRNA profiling is a promising new tool that can be valuable in diagnosing and differentiating several common hepatobiliary diseases in dogs.",

Improvement of serum \u03b2\u2010hydroxybutyric acid concentration is a marker of correction of the catabolic state.",

The aim of this retrospectvive study was to determine whether the aorto\u2010septal angle (AoSA), assessed by echocardiography, is correlated with the presence of a systolic murmur in cardiologically normal cats. The medical records between January 2014 and March 2016 have been reviewed. Inclusion criteria included a normal echocardiographic exam, regardless the presence of a cardiac murmur. Cats had also to be normotensive (systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg) and euthyroid. Cats with echocardiographic evidence of dynamic right ventricular outflow obstruction were not included. Cats with normal diastolic thickness of the left ventricle but mild hypertrophy of the sub\u2010aortic portion of the interventricular septum were also included. The AoSA was measured from the right parasternal five chambers view as previously described. For each echocardiographic parameter, the mean of three consecutive measures was used for statistics. Forty\u2010one cats of different breed were included; 21 females and 20 males, aging 6.4 \u00b1 5.5 (mean \u00b1 SD); 22 with a cardiac murmur, 19 without a cardiac murmur. The AoSA in cats with a cardiac murmur (131.1\u00b0\u00b1 8.6\u00b0) was significantly narrower (P = 0.048) than AoSA in cats without a cardiac murmur (136.3\u00b0\u00b1 7.2\u00b0). The presence of septal hypertrophy was not associated with the presence of a systolic murmur (P = 0.41). Cats with septal hypertrophy were older (P = 0.0037), however there was not correlation between AoSA and age (P > 0.05). In conclusion, a narrow AoSA is associated with the presence of a systolic murmur in cats and might be considered as potential cause of ejection murmur in apparently healthy cats. A longitudinal study is needed to assess if a narrow AoSA might play a role in the remodeling of the interventricular septum at the level of the left outflow tract.",

In human medicine, the sequence of ventricular depolarization results in a characteristic QRS complex pattern in each precordial lead: rS with a R:S ratio < 1 in the right precordial lead (V1) and qR in the left precordial leads (V5\u2010V6). The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the QRS complex morphology in precordial leads using a previously described precordial lead system in dogs with different morphotypes. Sixty healthy dogs were enrolled and underwent physical examination, thoracic radiographs, 12\u2010lead electrocardiogram using a system previously described and standard echocardiography. The dogs were allocated in three groups according the thoracic index (dorso\u2010ventral thorax diameter x 100/latero\u2010lateral thorax diameter): 90\u2013100 brachycephalic, 50\u201360 dolicocephalic and 60\u201390 mesocephalic. The Shapiro\u2010Wilcoxon W\u2010test was used to test normality. Mean value \u00b1 standard deviation as well median and range was calculated. Non\u2010parametric analysis of variance was performed on data to evaluate difference on QRS complex appearance among three thorax shape, by Kruskas Wallis test. To evaluate repeatability between three measurements the intraclass correlation coefficient was executed. All data analysis was performed by commercial available statistical software (SAS v9.2). Q wave was absent in V1, V2, V3 and V4 in all groups, present in V5 in dolicocephalic group and in V6 in all the groups. R wave amplitude in all precordial leads was statistically different between the three groups (P = 0.0000). Brachycephalic group showed lowest R wave amplitude, while the dolicocephalic group presented the highest R wave amplitude. S wave in V3 (P = 0.041) and V6 (P = 0.046) was statistically different between the three groups, showing the highest amplitude in the dolicocephalic group, and the lowest amplitude in mesocephalic group. R:S ratio in all precordial leads except V6 was statistically different between the three groups. In lead V1, brachycephalic dogs presented a ratio R:S < 1 while dolicocephalic and mesocephalic dog R:S > 1 (P = 0.0005). Based on this data, the previously proposed precordial lead system provides a correct evaluation of the ventricular depolarization of the right ventricle in lead V1 just in brachiocephalic dogs due to the different orientation of the cardiac dipole in the thorax. Further studies are needed to evaluate an alternative positioning of lead V1 in the latter two groups of dogs.",

Mitral valve (MV) morphology is a key factor in distributing forces over the MV apparatus, and abnormal loads could have a role in the pathogenesis of MMVD. We therefore sought to evaluate the morphology of the MV of healthy CKCS and compare it to the MV morphology of other canine breeds using real\u2010time three\u2010dimensional echocardiography (3DE). We hypothesized that, compared to other breeds, the MV of healthy CKCS was morphologically different. To be enrolled, dogs had to be healthy based on physical and echocardiographic examinations. A total of 63 dogs were enrolled in the study: 22 CKCS and 41 dogs from 18 other breeds. The median (IQR) body weight (BW) was 14 kg (8.8\u201320 kg). Three\u2010dimensional echocardiographic datasets were analyzed off\u2010line with a dedicated software package and 16 morphologic variables were measured. Variables with a known association to body size were indexed using previously reported scaling factors. Differences between CKCS and all the other breeds were analyzed using unpaired Student's T\u2010test or Mann\u2010Whitney U\u2010test as appropriate for data distribution. Compared to healthy dogs, CKCS had significantly smaller BW (P < 0.0001), normalized anterolateral\u2010posteromedial annulus diameter (P = 0.0320), annulus height (P = 0.0255), tenting height (P < 0.0001), tenting area (P < 0.0001), normalized tenting volume (P = 0.0001), posterior leaflet length (P = 0.0012), normalized posterior leaflet area (P = 0.0258), and greater annulus sphericity index (P = 0.0417). In conclusion, the MV of healthy CKCS was more circular and had less tenting, compared to other breeds.",

The aim of the present work was to determine the value of PV/PA for the prediction of tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) compared with other echocardiographic indices in dogs with pre\u2010capillary PH of different origins. Echocardiographic images obtained from dogs with a tricuspid regurgitant jet were retrospectively reviewed. PV/PA, acceleration time to ejection time ratio of the pulmonary flow (AT:ET), main pulmonary artery to aorta ratio (MPA/Ao) and right pulmonary artery distensibility index (RPADi) were evaluated. Dogs were grouped into control (Group1, n = 19, TRPG<30 mmHg), and mildly (Group2, n = 10, TRPG 30\u201050 mmHg), moderately (Group3, n = 4, TRPG 50\u201075 mmHg), and severely (Group4, n = 11, TRPG>75 mmHg) affected with PH. Ten dogs were clinically heathy, and the remaining 34 dogs were suffering from angiostrongylosis (n = 13), brachycephalic syndrome (n = 6), bronchomalacia (n = 6), heart\u2010worm disease (n = 2), chronic pulmonary thromboembolism (n = 2), PH of unknown origin (n = 2), eosinophilic bronnchopneumopathy (n = 1), pulmonary fibrosis (n = 1), and diffuse pulmonary carcinoma (n = 1). PV/PA (median, [IQ range]) in both two\u2010dimensional (2D) and M\u2010modes (MM) were significantly reduced in Group3 (PV/PA_MM = 0.590 [0.532\u20130.658]; PV/PA_2D = 0.543 [0.471\u20130.718]) and Group4 (PV/PA_MM = 0.341 [0.245\u20130.477]; PV/PA_2D = 0.324 [0.215\u20130.485]) in comparison with Group1 (PV/PA_MM = 0.974 [0.937\u20131.083]; PV/PA_2D = 0.958 [0.926\u20131.002]; P \u2264 0.007), and in Group4 in comparison with Group2 (PV/PA_MM = 0.835 [0.701\u20130.957]; PV/PA_2D = 0.831 [0.798\u20130.983]; P \u2264 0.005). Results of the Spearman correlation analyses revealed the strongest correlation for PV/PA_2D (r = \u20130.767, P < 0.0001) to TRPG followed by PV/PA_MM (r = \u20130.766, P < 0.0001), MPA/Ao (r = 0.720, P < 0.0001), RPADi (r = \u20130.567, P = 0.001) and AT:ET (r = \u20130.537, P = 0.003).

In conclusion, PV/PA measured in 2D or MM is an accurate predictor of TRPG and may be particularly useful if TR is absent or difficult to measure in dogs affected with pre\u2010capillary PH.",

It has been reported that American Cocker Spaniels have taurine deficiency and this is associated with reduced systolic function and dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype. Supplementation with taurine is known to improve echocardiographicparameters and clinical signs in the affected dogs. Cocker Spaniels affected by DCM appear to have a better outcome than other large breed dogs with DCM. No studies have been performed investigating taurine deficiency in English Cocker Spaniels (ECS). In addition, the natural progression of the disease in ECS affected by DCM has not been fully assessed. Our database was retrospectively searched for ECS diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Between 2003 and 2016, fifty\u2010nine ECS were assessed by the cardiology department of the Small Animal Teaching Hospital of the University of Liverpool. Eighteen of these dogs were diagnosed with DCM: 3 pre\u2010clinical and 15 clinical DCM. Seven were females and 11 were males. Their age at the time of initial admission was 7.2 years (range 1.5\u201011) and their weight was 15.1 kg (9.5\u201020.8). Heparinised plasma Taurine levels were measured in 16/18 dogs and were low in 13/16 (mean 16.07 \u03bcmol/L, range 1\u201039; normal reference 50\u2010180). When low, taurine supplementation was started, in addition to conventional cardiac medications. Of these 18 dogs, 3 were lost to follow\u2010up. Of the 15 remaining dogs, 7 were still alive at the time of this study and 8 were dead. Of the 3 dogs with preclinical DCM, one was still alive, the other two were dead but remained preclinical at the time of death. The mean survival time (MST) for the overall populations of dogs with clinical DCM was 1237.5 days (95% CI 510.8\u20101694.2).

Familiar dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary cardiac disease with genetic predisposition causing mainly left ventricular systolic failure. To the best to the authors knowledge there are no data regarding echocardiographic difference between these two disorders in the dog. The aim of this study was, therefore, to retrospectively evaluate echocardiographic parameters in dogs with AICM secondary to sustained accessory pathways\u2010mediated tachycardia (APMT) and in dogs with familiar DCM. According to the breed and the presence of APMT two groups of dogs were made, and for each group reported mono\u2010dimensional and B\u2010dimensional echocardiographic measurements indexed to body surface area were taken by one author (MP). Group A included 21 dogs of different breeds with a mean age (\u00b1 SD) of 2.8 \u00b1 2.1 years, a mean body weight of 28.0 \u00b1 6.7 kg, and M:F 2.5:1 with AICM induced by APMT diagnosed with endocardial mapping prior to the ablation of the accessory pathway, group B, 12 Doberman Pinschers with mean age of 7.3 \u00b1 2.3 years, a mean body weight of 34.8 \u00b1 7.0 kg, a M:F 1.4:1 with familiar DCM. In group A echocardiographic parameters obtained during sinus rhythm and during APMT were compared to assess the effects of acute changes in heart rate. Echocardiographic measurements obtained in both groups during sinus rhythm were then compared to determine possible screening factors to differentiate these two entities. Normal distribution of values was assessed by the Shapiro\u2010Wilk W\u2010test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student's t\u2010test and non\u2010normally distributed data using Wilcoxon's sum rank test. In group A, shortening fraction (FS) and 2\u2010D ejection fraction (EF) were significantly higher during sinus rhythm than during tachycardia (P respectively 0.001 and 0.004). Shortening fraction and 2D EF were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P respectively 0.002 and 0.007) while end\u2010diastolic volume index, end\u2010systolic volume index and E\u2010point\u2010septal separation were significantly lower than in group B (P respectively 0.03, 0.001, 0.01). The echocardiographic difference between AICM dogs and DCM dogs found may reflect different pathophysiologic mechanisms or different rate of evolution of these myocardial diseases. Further studies are needed to determine cut\u2010off values allowing the differentiation between AICM and familiar DCM.",

Creatinine (P = 0.925) and phosphate (P = 0.608) concentrations did not differ between groups. Ninety NT cats were available for Cox regression analysis, of which 22 developed hypertension. In the final multivariable model (n = 88), increasing SBP (P < 0.001), and decreasing PCV (P = 0.009) and body weight (<4.0 kg, P = 0.018) were significant risk factors for hypertension in feline CKD. In addition, FGF\u201023 (P = 0.018) was a significant independent risk factor for development of hypertension in the multivariable model (<400 pg/mL, HR:0.41, CI:0.15\u20101.17, P = 0.096; and 400\u20101200 pg/mL, HR:0.14, CI:0.04\u20100.57, P = 0.006, compared with >1200 pg/mL).",

Most studies of uGGT and uALP are limited to small number of dogs with AKI of a single etiology or to experimentally\u2010induced AKI. We aimed to investigate their clinical utility for diagnosing naturally occurring AKI in a large, heterogeneous group of dogs. The study included client\u2010owned dogs with AKI (34 dogs), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 13), urinary tract infection (UTI, 15) and healthy controls (51). uALP and uGGT activities were normalized to urinary creatinine concentration (uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea, respectively). uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea significantly correlated (r = 0.67, P < 0.001). Both differed significantly (P < 0.001) among study groups, and between the AKI group and either the UTI or CKD groups (P < 0.05), but not the control group. Areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves for uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea as predictors of AKI were 0.68 and 0.61, respectively. Optimal cut\u2010off points for uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea showed poor sensitivity/specificity (58%/70% and 58%/68%, respectively). Higher cut\u2010off points with 90% specificity were associated with decreased sensitivity (38%, 41%, respectively).In conclusion, uGGT/uCrea and uALP/uCrea demonstrated poor discriminatory power for diagnosing AKI in dogs, contrary to previous reports of naturally\u2010occurring and experimentally\u2010induced AKI, and therefore cannot be recommended as screening tests for AKI. uALP/uCrea is a superior marker of AKI to uGGT/uCrea. Since both measures are readily available and inexpensive, they may serve as ancillary biomarkers for early detection of AKI, if appropriate cut\u2010off points, with high specificities, are used.",

It is a common finding in dogs with predisposing conditions. The pathogenic potential of associated bacteria is not clearly understood, suggesting that these dogs require at least monitoring. This retrospective case\u2010crossover study sought to describe SBU in dogs that were followed longitudinally. Dogs that had cultures and concurrent urinalysis of cystocentesis\u2010derived urine performed on more than one occasion were identified from the records of U\u2010Vet Animal Hospital Werribee. Urine samples of dogs that were treated with antibiotics were excluded. Based on urine culture results and recorded clinical signs, dogs were classified as having clinical urinary tract infection, SBU or no growth of bacteria. Age, breed, sex, neuter status, concurrent conditions, microorganism cultured and urinalysis parameters were recorded. In each dog, urinalysis of SBU episodes and no\u2010growth episodes were compared using conditional logistic regression with the aim to assess the value of individual urinalysis parameters in predicting SBU in each dog. A total of 44 dogs were included with a total of 151 paired urinalysis and culture results. A median of 3 paired results (range 2\u201313) were reviewed in each dog. Many dogs had predisposing conditions; most common were changes in urine composition caused by endocrine disease or drugs (n = 18; 41%) or renal disease (n = 9; 20%). In 9 dogs (20%), no underlying condition was recorded. Dogs were of various breeds, predominantly female spayed (n = 29; 65%) and senior (median age 9 years, range 0.3\u201317). The most commonly cultured organisms in SBU were Escherichia coli (n = 22; 52%) and Enterococcus spp (n = 6; 14%). Five dogs had SBU with multi\u2010drug resistant bacteria. Whilst urinalysis parameters were often abnormal in the individual dogs, only pyuria (identified by microscopic sediment examination) was reliable in differentiating SBU from no\u2010growth episodes (OR 34; 95% CI 4.5\u2013266). This suggests that urinalysis parameters other than pyuria commonly reflect a concurrent disease process rather than SBU. Furthermore, it confirms that urine sediment analysis is crucial in monitoring dogs affected by conditions that predispose to SBU or UTI, particularly if urine culture is not planned.",

Although culture of urine sampled directly from the renal pelvis is the gold standard to confirm pyelonephritis, culture of urine obtained by cystocentesis is most commonly performed. But in case of ureteral obstruction culture of urine collected by cystocentesis could be negative because of interruption of urine flow in the affected ureter. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of pyelonephritis in feline ureteral obstruction, to investigate if clinical signs and laboratory findings could help diagnose pyelonephritis and to compare results of urine culture obtained by pyelocentesis and cystocentesis in the same individuals. Cats in which pyelocentesis was performed during surgical management of ureteral obstruction were retrospectively included. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed if a positive urine culture was obtained in the sample collected by pyelocentesis. Signalment, clinicopathologic data and abdominal ultrasonography findings were compared between cats with pyelonephritis (group P+) and cats with negative urine culture obtained by pyelocentesis (group P\u2010). Forty\u2010five cats were included. Culture of urine collected by pyelocentesis was positive in 8 of 45 (18%) cats. The isolates were E. coli (n = 3), Raoultella Terrigina (n = 3), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). The cats in the P+ group were significantly older than in the P\u2010group. The average monocyte count was significantly higher in the P+ group. No significant differences were observed concerning clinical data, other laboratory findings or results of abdominal ultrasonography between the two groups. Three of 8 cats of the P+ group and 9 of 37 cats of the P\u2010 group had received antibiotic therapy prior to the urine culture. In thirty\u2010three cats (7 from P+ group, 26 from P\u2010 group) urinary culture was also performed in samples collected by cystocentesis. In 4 of 7 (57%) cases from the P+ group, the urine obtained by cystocentesis was sterile and in 3 of 7 (43%) cases culture results were similar between the samples collected by pyelocentesis and cystocentesis. Two of 26 (8%) cats from the P\u2010group had a positive urine culture obtained by cystocentesis. In this study, the incidence of pyelonephritis in cats with ureteral obstruction was 18%. Common clinical and laboratory indicators of renal infection were absent in cases of confirmed pyelonephritis. The discrepancy between results of urine cultures obtained by cystocentesis or pyelocentesis emphasizes the difficulty of diagnosing pyelonephritis in the context of ureteral obstruction.",

Two types of commonly used insulin are lente insulin and Neutral Protamin Hegerdon (NPH) insulin. The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical trial was to compare the effects of lente and NPH insulin in dogs with DM. Client\u2010owned dogs with newly diagnosed DM were enrolled. Dogs with relevant concurrent diseases and with prior administration of diabetogenic drugs were excluded. Dogs were randomized into two groups such as lente insulin (Caninsulin\u00ae) and NPH insulin (Humulin I\u00ae). In each group dogs were treated with insulin SC, BID and fed BID with the same commercial diet low in simple carbohydrates and high in fiber. Follow\u2010up evaluations were done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 weeks. At each re\u2010evaluation a physical exam, blood glucose curve (BGC) and serum fructosamine concentrations were performed. The glycemic control was classified as good on the basis of absence of PU/PD, body weight stability, normal attitude/activity and >50% of the values in the BGC within 90 and 270 mg/dL. Eight dogs were treated with lente and 12 with NPH insulin. At the time of diagnosis (T0) both groups were homogenous considering age, body weight, gender, serum glucose concentrations and serum fructosamine concentrations. At the last re\u2010evaluation (T12) mean(\u00b1SD) glucose concentrations of BGCs and median(range) serum fructosamine concentrations evaluated in the lente group were 279 mg/dL (\u00b153), 474 \u03bcg/dL (336\u2013749) and in the NPH group were 219 mg/dL (\u00b1114), 419 \u03bcg/dL (292\u2013597), respectively; such differences were not significant between groups. Median(range) lente insulin dose per injection at T0 [0.35 U/kg (0.3\u20130.6)] was significantly lower (P = 0.007) compared with T12 (0.6 U/kg;0.4\u20130.9); median dose of NPH was not significantly different between T0 (0.3 U/kg; 0.1\u20130.4) and T12 (0.5 U/kg;0.2\u20130.7). Median fructosamine concentrations at T12 were significantly lower (P = 0.01) compared to T0 in the NPH group but not in the lente group (P = 0.4). At T12 good glycemic control was found in 25% (2/8) and in 75% (9/12) of dogs treated with lente and NPH insulin, respectively; however the difference was not significant (P = 0.06). Hypoglycemic events (nadir <90 mg/dL) were identified in 4 patients (4% of the BGCs in the lente group and 7% in the NPH group) and such difference was not significant. According to our preliminary results the use of both insulin preparates is effective in the treatment of dogs with DM, however the success rate with NPH insulin seems to be greater than that with lente insulin.",

Medical pituitary inhibition has been challenging in some humans and cats with this condition. This could be related to variable expression of somatostatin (SSTR) and dopamine (DR) receptor expression. There are five different SSTR subtypes (SSTR1\u20105) and five different subtypes of DRs, with D2R being the predominant DR subtype in the human pituitary. Pasireotide, a somatostatin analogue with high binding affinity to SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR5, is effective at controlling GH secretion in feline acromegalics but somatostatin analogues with high binding affinity to SSTR2 (octreotide and lanreotide) are not.

FRD shares many similarities to Coeliac Disease (CD) in humans, such as complete response to strict elimination diet, and typical histological findings such as shortening of the small intestinal villi. Autoantibodies used to test for CD in humans include anti\u2010reticulin, anti\u2010endomysium (anti\u2010EMA) and anti\u2010de\u2010amidated gliadin peptide antibodies. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anti\u2010reticulin, anti\u2010EMA and de\u2010amidated gliadin antibodies can be useful for the diagnosis of FRD in dogs. We hypothesized that anti\u2010EMA antibodies would be detected more frequently in dogs with FRD compared to healthy dogs and dogs with SRD. Antibodies were detected using a human indirect immunofluorescence assay that was adapted for use in canine patients. Tissues on the BIOCHIP\u2122 (Euroimmun Ltd, GE) for this assay included primate intestine, primate oesophagus, primate liver and GAF\u20103X (synthetic de\u2010amidated gliadin antigen).

Healthy control dogs and SRD dogs tested negative for any autoantibodies. All dogs with FRD tested negative for antibodies directed against endomysium and de\u2010amidated gliadin peptides, however, five out of 17 dogs with FRD tested positive for anti\u2010reticulin antibodies. There was a significant association between the presence of food\u2010responsive disease and a positive immunofluorescence response for anti\u2010reticulin antibodies when compared to the healthy control (P = 0.014) and SRD groups (P = 0.009).

Prior studies have failed to detect a convincing association between mucosal histopathology and clinical signs, or response to therapy and outcome in dogs with IBD. For this reason, a standardized grading scheme for the interpretation of GI histopathologic findings was introduced (WSAVA grading scheme). However, no larger scale studies so far have evaluated whether clinical scoring systems linearly correlate with the WSAVA histopathological grading scheme. Such information would be useful for the clinician as WSAVA grading could be used to monitor treatment response and may give prognostic information. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dogs that were diagnosed with IBD and had clinical scoring performed using the Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI) and histopathology scoring using the WSAVA scoring scheme are linearly correlated to one another. Electronic data of WSAVA graded endoscopically retrieved biopsy scores assigned by a veterinary pathologist at one single centre were collected. A maximum of five sites were evaluated per animal: stomach; pylorus (n = 87) and fundus (n = 46), duodenum (n = 96), ileum (n = 37) and colon (n = 61). One hundred and two dogs diagnosed with IBD were included in this study. WSAVA scores were compared to the CCECAI scores assigned to the animals at the time of diagnosis. Linear correlation was assessed using Spearman Rank's test. Linear correlation of scores was very weak, with r2 ranging from 0.009 to 0.249 (gastric fundus; r2= 0.05, gastric pylorus; r2 = 0.028, duodenum; r2 = 0.249, ileum; r2 = 0.009 and colon; r2 = 0.095). The only site where linear correlation was significant was the duodenum (r2 = 0 .249, P = 0.014). This study indicates that linear correlation of the two grading systems is weak and that clinicians should not rely on one system to predict scores of the other. Studies correlating scores before and after treatment in large numbers of dogs are indicated to further evaluate predictive ability of the WSAVA score.",

E. coli was cultured from endoscopically collected mucosal biopsy material on Sheep Blood agar and MacConkey. Colonies showing characteristics consistent with E. coli were identified using API20E (bioM\u00e9rieux). DNA was extracted from the strains using the MagNA Pure 96\u00ae System (Roche), followed by loop\u2010mediated isothermal PCR amplification (LAMP) to detect the presence of shigatoxin (stx1 und stx2), heat\u2010stable enterotoxin (sta), and attaching and effacing (intimin) gene (eae).

            "text": "Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive parenchymal lung disease of unknown origin affecting mainly old West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). CIPF shares several clinical and pathologic features with human IPF. The use of next generation sequencing technologies recently allowed to identify differences in the composition and diversity of the respiratory microbiota in human IPF. Increased bacterial burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of IPF patients was proved to predict decline in lung function and mortality, with Heamophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella spp. being more abundant in IPF cases. The objectives of the present work were to identify and characterize the microbiota present in the lower respiratory tract of healthy beagle dogs and healthy WHWTs compared with the microbiota of WHWTs affected with CIPF. For this purpose, BALF samples were obtained from 4 groups of dogs: young healthy research beagles (n = 6, median age 7.6 months), adult healthy research beagles (n = 6, 8.8 years), healthy client\u2010owned old WHWTs (n = 5, 11.2 years) and client\u2010owned WHWTs affected with CIPF (n = 7, 11.6 years). Metagenetic analysis were performed on V1\u2010V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA after total bacterial DNA extraction from BAL specimens and sequencing on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Taxonomical assignation and microbiota community analysis were done with MOTHUR V1.35 with an OTU clustering distance of 0.03. Data analyses demonstrated that the same phyla predominated in all groups of dogs with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being the most abundant in a descending order. Bacterial species richness was significantly higher and evenness significantly lower in WHWTs, either healthy or affected with CIPF, in comparison with beagles, while there was no difference between groups for bacterial diversity. Beyond the effect of the breed, impact of the living environment (house\u2010holding vs. experimental kennel) might serve as an explanation for those differences observed between beagles and WHWTs. When comparing specifically CIPF WHWTs with healthy WHWTs, Pasteurella, Conchiformibius and Bergeyella spp. were found more abundant in CIPF dogs. Whether those alterations in the respiratory microbiota of CIPF dogs are a cause of a consequence of the disease remain to be elucidated. In conclusion, results of the present study demonstrate the existence of a core airways microbiota in dogs that might be influenced by the breed, the environment or the disease status. Further studies are needed to better understand whether alteration in the microbiota may take part in the pathogenesis or in the predisposition for CIPF.",

In humans with pneumonia APPs have also great utility as follow\u2010up biomarkers. In order to investigate the applicability of APPs as biomarkers of treatment response in dogs with BP, serum C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) were followed simultaneously along with hematology, serum biochemistry, arterial blood gas analysis and thoracic radiographs during a natural course of BP (n = 19). 64 healthy dogs were included as controls. All measured APPs were initially significantly elevated in dogs with BP compared to healthy controls, but the magnitude of elevation was not connected to disease severity. CRP and SAA reflected well the recovery process and declined rapidly after initiation of therapy. Normalization of serum CRP was applied to guide the length of antibiotic therapy (therapy was stopped 5\u20137 days after CRP normalization) in 9/17 dogs surviving to discharge (median treatment length 21 days, IQR 19\u201329 days), whereas 8/17 dogs were treated according to conventional recommendations (median 35, IQR 29\u201348 respectively). When CRP was applied to guide antibiotic therapy, treatment length was significantly (P = 0.015) reduced without increasing the number of relapses. According to this study serum CRP and SAA may be used as biomarkers of treatment response and the normalization of serum CRP may be applied to guide the length of antibiotic therapy in dogs with BP.",

            "text": "Eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy (EBP) is a canine respiratory disease characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the lung and bronchial mucosa. Hypersensitivity reaction to aerosolized antigens is suspected to act in the pathogenesis of the disease, while the exact inciting antigens remain presently unidentified. In humans, Aspergillus spp. has been proposed as potential trigger for inflammatory/allergic bronchial disease. In dogs, the association between Aspergillus and canine inflammatory bronchopneumopathy has not yet been explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the presence of Aspergillus spp. in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from dogs affected with EBP, compared with healthy dogs and dogs with chronic bronchitis (CB). For this purpose, BALF samples collected from 23 dogs with EBP (mean age = 4.5 years), 14 healthy dogs (6.3 years), and 21 dogs with CB (7.2 years) were retrospectively included and two qPCR assays were used: Aspergillus spp. and Aspergillus fumigatus. qPCR results were expressed as Ct values; Ct value above 32.1 corresponding to very low DNA copy numbers. Aspergillus spp. qPCR yielded positive results in two EBP dogs (Ct = 34 and 33), 1 CB dog (Ct = 36) and one healthy dog (Ct = 33), while Aspergillus fumigatus qPCR was only positive in the same 2 EBP dogs (Ct = 32), but not in healthy and CB dogs. Results of the present study suggest that an association between Aspergillus and canine EBP is unlikely. However, absence of Aspergillus genetic material in BALF samples cannot definitively rule out the implication of this pathogen in the disease. Future studies should include investigation of serum Aspergillus\u2010specific antibodies in order to definitively elucidate the role of Aspergillus fumigatus in canine EBP.",

Treatment was planned in 53.4% of dogs and 48.5% of cats that presented for a neoplastic condition, although in \u02dc26.0% of dogs and cats the decision to treat was not determined at the time of consultation. The most common treatment planned was surgery in dogs (57.8%) and analgesia / anti\u2010inflammatory in cats (39.8%); mainly performed in general practice.

Previous work has demonstrated that canine melanoma cell lines may contain activated AKT and mTOR pathways, as well as sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin. The aim of this study was to assess combination treatment using dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR and compare results to that achieved with inhibition of each pathway individually. Five established primary canine melanoma cell lines were grown in monolayer culture in vitro under standard conditions. Cell lines were derived from a canine primary oral melanoma, primary cutaneous melanoma, metastatic lymph node, or subcutaneous metastasis. Cells were treated with PI3k inhibitor LY294002, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or dual inhibitor GSK2126458 for 24 \u201072 hours. Cell viability was assessed using resazurin dye, with absorbance read on a spectrophotometer. Western blot was used to evaluate drug treatment impact on pathway components, including phosphorylated and total AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K. A dose\u2010dependent decrease in cell viability was observed in all cell lines. Dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR with GSK2126458 was more potent in pathway target inhibition and resulted in lower cell viability IC50 values than either of the other drugs tested. Dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR may be more efficacious than single pathway targeting in canine melanoma cells. Future studies will assess the potential for this targeted strategy to sensitize the chemotherapy response in this notoriously treatment resistant tumour type.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a new dietetic food (NDF)* to achieve weight loss and to improve mobility in obese/overweight client\u2010owned dogs with osteoarthritis. The objectives were 1) to evaluate weight loss parameters and 2) to assess clinical signs related to osteoarthritis in dogs fed the NDF. Thirty\u2010eight dogs were enrolled in the study. Initial and follow\u2010up evaluations (monthly for 6 months) included determination of body weight, body condition score (BCS), body fat index (BFI), and evaluation of osteoarthritis\u2010related parameters as assessed by the veterinarian (lameness, weight bearing, pain on joint palpation) and the owner (difficulty rising, aggression, reluctance to walk and to play, inactivity). Begging behaviour, faecal score and acceptance of food were also evaluated. Initial veterinary consultation consisted of physical examination, nutritional assessment, determination of ideal body weight (IBW), development of weight\u2010loss feeding guidelines (DER = 70 x IBWkg0.75), and explanation of the assessments performed. Statistical analysis comprised scatterplots, regression analysis, summary statistics, Friedman's chi\u2010square test, and a mixed model ANOVA to assess changes over time (statistical significance P < 0.05). Eighty nine percent of the dogs lost weight (n = 34) with an average weight loss of 12.6% (SEM, 1.3%) over 6 months and an average weekly weight\u2010loss rate of 0.5% (SEM, 0.04%) of starting body weight. The mean duration of weight loss was 174 days (SD, 36 days) with an average of 33 days (SD, 13 days) between rechecks. BCS and BFI in the dogs that lost weight were significantly lower compared with baseline in months 2\u20136 of the study. Difficulty rising and reluctance to play improved significantly compared with baseline starting at month 2 of the study whereas reluctance to walk and inactivity improved significantly compared with baseline starting at month 3 of the study. Similarly, lameness, weight bearing, and pain on palpation improved significantly compared with baseline starting in month 3 of the study. Faecal scores were unaffected and begging was significantly lower in months 3 and 4 compared with baseline. In conclusion, this clinical study confirmed the effectiveness of the NDF* in achieving weight loss and improvement of clinical signs related to osteoarthritis in overweight/obese client\u2010owned dogs. Owners and veterinarians reported significant improvements in dog's weight and mobility without negative side effects.",

This study was designed to analyze the various components of trans\u2010tracheal wash (TTW) of CD infected dogs For this purpose 25 dogs: 12 apparently healthy dogs and 13 CD infected dogs diagnosed by immune\u2010chromatographic assay on ocular and nasal discharges (The Canine Distemper Ag Test Kit). All dogs were submitted to cytological, biochemical and microbiological examinations of TTW as well as hematological examination. CD infected dogs were sub\u2010grouped into complicated and non\u2010complicated groups. Hematological findings of non\u2010complicated group revealed insignificant lymphopenia with significant monocytosis. Regarding complicated group, the hematological constituent showed regenerative anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis. Microscopical examination of blood smear in both groups showed canine distemper inclusion bodies inside neutrophils and red blood corpuscles which is characteristic for canine distemper. Concerning the cytological findings of TTW of complicated and non\u2010complicated dogs, the results revealed significant decrease of alveolar macrophages, lymphocyte and epithelial cells with significant increase in reactive macrophages and degenerated neutrophils.

            "text": "A vaccine against canine leishmaniosis was launched in some European Countries in 2011. Since then, veterinarians practicing in Spain, an endemic focus of canine leishmaniosis, have sporadically diagnosed clinical leishmaniosis in dogs previously vaccinated. The aim of this descriptive retrospective study was to define and evaluate clinicopathological findings in dogs with canine leishmaniosis previously vaccinated with CaniLeish. An active search for clinical cases from several veterinary hospitals in Spain was carried out. Sixteen sick dogs with clinical signs and/or clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with leishmaniosis and diagnosed based on visualization of Leishmania amastigotes by cytological evaluation, histopathological evaluation \u00b1 immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques were included. Clinical records as well as laboratory or imaging reports were thoroughly evaluated and information was gathered. The clinical presentation of all the dogs diagnosed with clinical leishmaniosis occurred between September 2012 and February 2016. Age ranged from one to 9 years with a median of 3.5 years. The majority of dogs (n = 13, 81%) were pure bred with 85% (n = 11) belonging to large breeds such as the Boxer or Labrador and only 15% (n = 2) to small breeds (Yorkshire Terrier and French Bull dog). Three large mixed\u2010breed dogs (19%) were also diagnosed. Interestingly, males (n = 11, 69%) were more frequently diagnosed than females (n = 5, 31%). The most common clinicopathological findings were ulcerative or nodular cutaneous lesions, lymphadenomegaly, lameness, mild to moderate non\u2010regenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, proteinuria and renal azotemia. Serology based on immunofluorescence or quantitative ELISA at the time of diagnosis was positive in all dogs with the exception of one dog, which was negative. Most dogs received a full vaccination protocol, although in some cases, vaccine was not administered in the same veterinary center where clinical leishmaniosis was diagnosed. Dogs were apparently healthy at the time of vaccination and most of them were considered seronegative based on a rapid serological test. Interestingly, the majority of dogs were diagnosed with clinical leishmaniosis prior to the first annual revaccination. The mean \u00b1 standard deviation of time between vaccination and appearance of clinical illness was 7 \u00b1 3 months with a range of 2 and 12 months. In conclusion, this study describes, for the first time, clinicopathological data in dogs with leishmaniosis after vaccination. Moreover, the majority of dogs were diagnosed few months after vaccination highlighting the importance of the use of accurate screening diagnostic tests prior to vaccination in dogs living in endemic areas.",

            "text": "Tick\u2010borne encephalitis is a zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks. The causative agent is tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus. Since no anti\u2010TBEV canine vaccine is available, seropositivity of dogs indicates natural exposures to Flavivirus. Dogs have served as sentinels in identifying the risk areas for humans of the natural Flavivirus foci and the seroprevalences in healthy dogs were shown to fluctuate from 0\u201330% depending on areas. Dogs may be resistant to developing clinical signs but clinical cases are often fatal. Our study had two aims: (i) assess the TBEV\u2010seroprevalence in dogs showing neurological signs and its relationship with regard to gender, age and breed, (ii) evaluate the possible concordance of TBEV\u2010seroprevalence and the specific areas suspected of Flavivirus foci in accordance with the RKI (Robert\u2010Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany) classification of \u2018risk counties\u2019. Between 2013 and 2015, we analysed 433 blood samples obtained from dogs with various unspecified neurological signs suspected of TBEV\u2010infection. The majority of the samples came from Germany (299), Austria (54), Czech Republic (33), Sweden (15), Switzerland (12), and Norway (10). IgG\u2010antibodies to TBEV were assayed using a commercially available ELISA. Based on the Antibody\u2010titre results, dogs could be classified as follows: Ab\u2010positive (>126 U/ml): 48/433 (11.1%), \u2018borderline range\u2019 (\u226563 \u2264 126 U/ml): 20/433 (4.6%), and Ab\u2010negative (<63 U/ml): 365/433 (84.3%). By breed with \u226510 dogs, Ab\u2010positive dogs were in the following decreasing order: Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, Mongrels, and Bernese Mountain Dogs. No gender\u2010dependency could be detected. The median age of the Ab\u2010positive dogs was 6.5 (1\u201313) years. 28/299 (9.4%) dogs from Germany were Ab\u2010positive and 27/28 (96.4%) came from risk areas (Bavaria, Baden\u2010Wuerttemberg, Hesse, Thuringia, and Saarland). Dogs from other countries presented the following Ab\u2010positivity; Austria: 14/54 (26%), Czech Republic: 4/33 (12.1%), Norway: 1/10 (10%) and Switzerland: 0/12 (0%). Our present study showed that (i) Retrievers were the predominant breeds with respect to TBEV\u2010seropositivity and (ii) a high concordance was confirmed between seropositive dogs with neurological signs and the TBEV\u2010risk areas in Germany as defined by the classification of the RKI. Our data also suggested that, although seroprevalence could be low, TBE should be considered a potentially useful differential diagnosis in dogs with neurological signs when the dog has a history of travelling or living in risk areas and, in that case, the serological diagnosis should be confirmed by a paired sample, taken two weeks apart.",

ICG clearance determination has been used successfully to evaluate hepatic function in laboratory dogs. However, it has rarely been used in clinical setting as the analysis of the serum ICG concentration requires an advanced laboratory technique (high performance liquid chromatography). Our recent study in healthy Beagle dogs revealed a good correlation (r\u00b2 = 0.81) between ICG clearance and a transcutaneous method determining the ICG plasma disappearance rate (ICG\u2010PDR in %/min) with a near infrared spectroscopy probe placed on the tail (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023315004645). In human medicine, the main indication for measuring ICG\u2010PDR has been the prognostic assessment of liver failure and liver transplantation. The present study evaluated the day\u2010to\u2010day variation of ICG\u2010PDR in healthy Beagle dogs to assess the repeatability of the test.",

ICG was given intravenously (0.5 mg/kg) and ICG\u2010PDR was determined by using the PulsioFlex monitoring platform with the LiMon module probe (Pulsion, Munich, Germany). Daily ICG\u2010PDR values from all dogs were compared and the coefficient of intrasubject variation (%CV) was calculated. Mean ICG\u2010PDR was 7.8 \u00b1 3.4%/min on day one, 8.8 \u00b1 3.7%/min on day two, and 7.9 \u00b1 2.6%/min on day three. There was no significant difference between the days and the mean ICG\u2010PDR was similar to previously reported data (7.79 \u00b1 3.3%/min). However, the mean %CV of ICG\u2010PDR was very high (35.9 \u00b1 16.8%) with the ighest individual %CV being 52.5%. In this limited number of animals, repeatability of transcutaneous ICG\u2010PDR in its current form was rather poor. It seems unlikely that the test method will be useful for the repeated assessment of mild to moderate changes in canine liver function. However, future studies are warranted to assess the prognostic value of ICG\u2010PDR for canine patients with severe acute or chronic end stage liver failure comparable to its current indication in human medicine.",

In this study, a hybrid technique was used to permit coil embolization using larger catheters in smaller animals or to enable the approach of difficult access shunting vessels (SV). We reviewed clinico\u2010surgical features, laboratory data, abdominal imaging results (contrasted\u2010computed tomography [CT] and portography), and outcomes in two male dogs (Yorkshire terrier [YT] and Akita [AK]), and three male cats (Exotic Short Hair [EH], American Short Hair [AH] Russian Blue [RB]) with PSS. Intrahepatic (IH) PSS between the portal vein (PV) and the caudal vena cava were diagnosed in four animals [YT, AK, EH, RB] and an extrahepatic shunt in the cat [AH]. Diagnoses and accurate SV anatomy were obtained from perioperative CT and intraoperative portography images associate with hyperammonemia. Left\u2010sided IHPSS were visualized in four animals. Two cats presented seizure episodes previous to the surgery. Two dogs and a cat had previously undergone partial shunt ligation with posterior recurrent hyperammonemia. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was nine months (range five to twelve months). French multipurpose catheters (3\u20135Fr) were inserted in the mesenteric vein or PV and advanced to the shunt site through a guidewire after transperitoneal approaches. Coil anchors were inserted in the SV of a dog [AK] and a cat [RB] previous to coil embolization procedure. PSS attenuation required deployment of additional coils due to persistent shunting flow in the dogs. The pushable coils were used to occlude PSS in the dogs because of low probability of coil migration, and the detachable microcoils were used to occlude the PSS in the cats due to the adaptability to irregular SVs and possibility of retrieve the device in case of instable coil deployment. PV pressures were measured to determine pre\u2010 and post\u2010occlusion plausible changes. Preoperative serum ammonia ranged from 95 to 254 \u03bcmol/L and from 15 to 130 \u03bcmol/L in postoperative period. Serum liver enzymes remained elevated in the follow\u2010up period in all patients. However, neurological and gastrointestinal abnormalities gradually improved in the short\u2010term post\u2010operative period. The residual PSS flow is expected to gradually cease due to blood clotting around the coils. Nevertheless, a long\u2010term follow\u2010up is recommended after PSS attenuation because of the risks involving coil dislocation and shunt recanalization. Follow\u2010up signs of liver dysfunction were managed using low protein diet and hepatoprotectives drugs.",

It is decreased below reference intervals in dogs with severe pulmonary hypertension. However, TAPSE, a linear measurement of tricuspid annular movement, scales non\u2010linearly with bodyweight in dogs. We examined whether TAPSE could be normalized to linear aortic measurements to create a bodyweight\u2010independent measure of RV systolic function. Echocardiographic evaluations were performed on 127 healthy dogs (50 dogs had been included in a previous study of TAPSE), 55 dogs with heart disease but no pulmonary hypertension (tricuspid regurgitant velocity <3 m/s) and 39 dogs with pulmonary hypertension of various etiologies and severities (tricuspid regurgitant velocity >2.9 m/s). TAPSE:Ao was regressed against bodyweight and, in dogs with pulmonary hypertension, against tricuspid velocity. TAPSE scaled non\u2010linearly against bodyweight (as previously reported), but TAPSE:Ao largely removed the effect of bodyweight, with a non\u2010parametrically determined lower reference limit of 0.67. Only 3/127 healthy dogs had TAPSE:Ao <0.7. Dogs with heart disease but no pulmonary hypertension showed a slight negative association of TAPSE:Ao with bodyweight with 4/55 dogs having TAPSE:Ao <0.7. In dogs with pulmonary hypertension TAPSE:Ao had a negative association with tricuspid velocity. However, only 5/39 dogs had TAPSE:Ao <0.7; all these dogs had TR velocities >4.4 m/s. TAPSE:Ao <0.7 was 97% specific, but only 38% sensitive in identifying dogs with severe pulmonary hypertension. TAPSE:Ao is a bodyweight independent measure of RV systolic function in dogs. Normal dogs have TAPSE:Ao >0.67. However, it does not appear to be a sensitive indicator of pulmonary hypertension.",

In healthy dogs reference values of ST\u2010HRV were publish (Pol J Vet Sci. 2015, 18, 307\u2013312). The aim of the study was to compare normal value of short\u2010term HRV in healthy dogs (H) (n = 50) and dogs with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) (n = 10). The ECG was recorded continuously for at least 180 min in dark and clam room. All QRS complexes from ECG were first edited automatically and then manually by careful inspection of the RR intervals. The data had no atrial or ventricular premature complexes. Signals were transformed into a spectrum by Fast Fourier Transformation. Heart rate variability parameters were measured at fixed time at the number of sample 60 min. Separate frequency (Hz) components of the HRV were obtained including very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power (TP) and LF/HF ratio. The time domain parameters (ms) were analyzed as follows: mean NN, SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index and pNN50 (mean \u00b1 SD). A computerized software package Statistica version 10.0, StatSoft, Poland was used to statistically analyse the data. Data were compared by t\u2010test.

Fifty\u2010eight client\u2010owned dogs were enrolled in this study: 48 dogs with confirmed cardiovascular disease and 10 healthy dogs. Cardiovascular patients were classified into ISACHC classes. Cardiovascular disease was confirmed on the basis of history, clinical examination, thoracic radiographs, electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Patients with other diseases were excluded from the study. Serum concentrations of inflammatory markers were determined with ELISA kits. Plasma NT\u2010proBNP (second\u2010generation Cardiopet\u00ae proBNP) levels were analysed by IDEXX Laboratory. Kruskal\u2010Wallis analysis followed by the Mann\u2010Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.008) was used for comparison of measured parameters among groups of patients and healthy dogs. The effect of therapy was tested with Mann\u2010Whitney U test. Interleukin\u20106 and TNF\u2010alpha concentrations did not differ significantly among ISACHC groups and between control group and ISACHC groups. The highest TNF\u2010alpha concentration was found in ISACHC III (median 7.956 pg/mL versus 3.900 pg/mL in ISACHC II and I). CRP concentration was significantly higher in ISACHC III (3.53 mg/L) and ISACHC II (4.401 mg/L) than in control group (0.900 mg/L); however no significant differences in CRP concentrations were found among ISACHC groups. The results showed no significant differences in any of measured parameters between patients with and withouth therapy. A positive significant correlation was found between NT\u2010proBNP and IL\u20106 in ISACHC II; correlations with TNF\u2010alpha and CRP were not significant in neither group of patients. Increased CRP concentrations in advanced stages of heart failure and significant positive correlation between IL\u20106 and NT\u2010proBNP indicate systemic inflammation in dogs with CHF. Therapy had no effect on measured inflammatory markers. Futher studies in larger groups of canine cardiovascular patients might confirm that cytokines are responsible for the progression of heart failure.",

BNP is produced by myocardiocytes in response to stress but is overwhelmed by other neurohormonal systems during heart failure. In humans with acute congestive heart failure, exogenous intravenous BNP helps alleviate signs of dyspnea. In addition, BNP has longer\u2010term anti\u2010remodeling properties, and developing methods to chronically administer BNP to humans and dogs with heart disease is a subject of interest. Administration of exogenous BNP has not been previously reported in privately\u2010owned dogs. We sought to determine the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of subcutaneous synthetic canine B\u2010type natriuretic peptide (syncBNP) (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) by performing a modified 3 \u00d7 3 phase\u20101 intra\u2010patient dose escalation study in 6 dogs, including 2 healthy dogs and 4 dogs with stage B1 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Stage 1 involved administering a \u201csubtherapeutic\u201ddose of 2.5 mcg/kg syncBNP to 3 dogs followed by a second \u201ctherapeutic\u201ddose of 5.0 mcg/kg 4 hours later. Stage 2 administered a baseline dose of 5.0 mcg/kg followed by a \u201cmaximum\u201ddose of 10.0 mcg/kg 4 hours later in an additional 3 dogs. syncBNP injections were well\u2010tolerated in all dogs at all concentrations with no statistically significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, or serum creatnine and BUN before and after syncBNP administration. Median plasma cGMP concentration was significantly higher at 45 and 120 minutes after the 5.0 mcg/kg dose as compared to baseline (baseline, 131.5 pmol/mL [IQR = 117.5\u2013144.8]; 45 min, 154.6 [145.6\u2013205.7]; 120 min, 192.7\u2013153.1\u2013239.6]; P = 0.042). There were no significant differences in serum aldosterone, plasma renin activity, urine specific gravity, urinary fractional excretion of sodium, or urinary cGMP concentration. A single subcutaneous injection of syncBNP at 5.0 mcg/kg did not cause any adverse reactions and was associated with an increase in the BNP secondary messenger, cGMP. Further studies investigating the clinical utility of acute and chronic syncBNP in dogs with naturally\u2010occurring heart disease are warranted.",

Its prevalence increases with severity of DMVD and its presence is a predictor of worse outcome. Left atrial (LA) function and size are prognostic indicators in DMVD. In dogs, LA contractile function has been shown to decrease with severity of DMVD. In human with chronic mitral regurgitation, LA function is an important correlate of right ventricular systolic pressure. The aim of this study was to assess if LA dysfunction was associated with PH in dogs with DMVD. Dogs with DMVD and a measurable tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were retrospectively recruited. Maximal LA diameter, LA diameter at the onset of the P wave and minimal LA diameter were measured on anatomic M\u2010mode from 2D cineloops on aortic short axis view. Left atrial reservoir (LA expansion index; Total LA shortening fraction), conduit (Passive LA shortening fraction) and contractile function (Active LA shortening fraction) indices were derived from above measures. Ninety three dogs including ACVIM stage B1 (22), B2 (28), C (39) and D (4), were included. Dogs were assigned to pulmonary hypertensive group (PH) (TR pressure gradient >40 mmHg) (n = 29, median: 51 mmHg; range: 40\u2013114) or pulmonary normotensive group (PN) (n = 64, 29 mmHg; 5\u201340). LA reservoir and contractile function indices were reduced in ACVIM stage C and D compared to asymptomatic stages (P < 0.001) and TR pressure gradient was higher in symptomatic dogs (P < 0.05) compared to asymptomatic dogs. TR gradient was positively correlated with LA size measured at different time intervals (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with LA reservoir (P = 0.02) and contractile (P = 0.009) variables LA reservoir variables (P = 0.008), and active LA shortening fraction (P = 0.006) were lower in PH group compared to PN ANCOVA was used to test the categorical effect of ACVIM stages along with the effects of LA function indices on TR pressure gradient. ACVIM stage had a strong effect on TR gradient (P < 0.001) but LA function parameters did not persist after correction for ACVIM stages. This study confirmed that, in dogs with DMVD, PH is strongly associated with the stage of heart failure but failed to show an independent relationship between LA dysfunction and development of PH. The reason may be a lack of accuracy of one dimensional variables to assess LA phasic function or the absence of causal link between LA dysfunction and development of pulmonary hypertension in DMVD dogs.",

When 2/3 of the kidneys become dysfunctional, clinical signs are apparently present in the patient. In this study, enzymuria and microalbuminuria were evaluated in eighty dogs with the lower urinary tract symptoms (pollakiuria, dysuria\u2010stranguria, hematuria, urinary incontinence, polyuria, polydipsia, excessive licking of the urogenital area) that were referred to Istanbul University, Veterinary Teaching and Research Hospital, Internal Medicine Clinics. Blood and urine samples were collected aseptically from each dog. The specific parameters that were detected in the study were; urine microalbumin concentration (Heska\u00ae E.R.D.\u2010HealthScreen Canine Urine Test), urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC), urine culture and enzymes (urine N\u2010acetyl\u2010beta\u2010D\u2010glucosaminidase (NAG), Alkaline phosphatese (ALP), Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Alanin Aminopeptidase (AAP) ). The blood pressure was measured with high definition oscillometric device (Memodiagnostic\u00ae). Statistical analysis \u201cGeneral Linear Model\u201dwas based on gender, age, nutrition, microalbuminuria and urinary tract disorders of the dogs. With the comparison of urine dipstick, urine protein\u2010creatinine ratio and microalbuminuria test results, it was agreed that microalbuminuria test was the most trustable and the practical method in small animal practice. It was also determined that microalbuminuria levels could be affected from the many factors like age and nutrition. Except microalbuminuria, the enzymes especially NAG and AAP were markedly elevated in dogs with lower urinary tract disorders. Thus, it was approved that parameters that were controlled in this study, can be easily used in routine veterinary practice. Thereby, with the early detection of proteinuria, it was aimed to notice fractional variations in the kidneys and increase the duration of life span and the life quality of dogs.

This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of baseline cortisol in the interpretation of ACTHST. The study included samples from 73 dogs, submitted to a referral laboratory for evaluation of HAC by ACTHST, and completed questionnaires about the referring veterinarians\u2019 (rDVMs) interpretation of the results. rDVMs reported whether the test results were considered confirmatory for HAC, how baseline and post\u2010stimulation cortisol were interpreted, and their final decision whether the dog had HAC. Most rDVMs (77%) considered both baseline (B) and post\u2010stimulation (P) cortisol in their interpretation, either their difference (P\u2010B) or their ratio (P/B). Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to assess the predictive accuracy of baseline cortisol alone, post\u2010stimulation cortisol alone, P\u2010B and P/B. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for baseline cortisol, P/B, P\u2010B, and post\u2010stimulation cortisol were 0.61, 0.62, 0.84 and 0.89, respectively, when the outcome was a confirmatory result, and 0.63, 0.58, 0.77 and 0.85, respectively, when the outcome was a final diagnosis of HAC. Post\u2010stimulation cortisol AUCs were significantly higher than all other AUCs, excluding P\u2010B AUC, for predicting a confirmatory result of HAC. In conclusion, post\u2010stimulation cortisol demonstrated good discriminatory ability for the interpretation of the ACTHST, and for the final diagnosis made by rDVMs. It was either superior or comparable to P\u2010B while baseline cortisol and P/B were ineffective. Baseline cortisol has no additive value in interpreting ACTHST results and diagnosing HAC by rDVMs.",

Six of these dogs (4%) had gastric carcinoma, including Tervuren (3), Rough Collie, Labrador Retriever and Rottweiler. Gastric metaplasia was diagnosed in six dogs of other breeds: Smooth Collie (2), Wire\u2010haired Dachshund, Shetland Sheepdog, Hovawart, and Siberian Husky. Logistic regression analysis revealed significantly higher odds ratio (OR) to undergo GDS for Wire\u2010haired Dachshund with 2.42 (95% confidence interval: lower 1.14\u2013higher 5.15), Smooth Collie with 2.36 (1.04\u20135.32), and Rough Collie with 1.72 (1.05\u20132.81).

Like in previous studies, Tervuren undergoing GDS were found at much higher risk to have gastric carcinoma. The high OR for Wire\u2010haired Dachshund and Collies to undergo GDS might indicate a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders beside neoplasia, warranting further studies. Gastric metaplasia was as rare as gastric cancer and no breed predisposition was found. Nonetheless, metaplasia can present as discrete, flat changes that are easily overlooked and possibly underdiagnosed considering the limitations of current white light endoscopy techniques and non\u2010directed sampling procedures. Future prospective studies in predisposed breeds should aim at applying more advanced endoscopic approaches to improve the knowledge about prevalence and breed predisposition of metaplasia and its possible association to canine gastric cancer.",

The aim of this retrospective single\u2010center study was to evaluate prognostic factors able to influence the response to treatment in dogs with IBD. Dogs with a diagnosis of idiopathic IBD, treated with immunosuppressive drugs, were enrolled. History about drugs and diet previously employed, clinical signs, laboratory findings, treatment, and follow\u2010up, were recorded. Data from September 2004 to December 2014 were reviewed. Group 1, were defined as dogs that had responded to treatment, in which immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotic treatment was discontinued without relapses. Group 2, were defined as dogs that responded to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs but the disease relapsed after interruption of treatment. Group 3, were defined as dogs that did not respond to diet, antibiotic and immunosuppressive drugs. Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves were obtained for groups 1, 2 and 3; the survival curves for these groups were compared using the log\u2010rank test. A two stage\u2010analysis was also applied. In the first univariate stage, the variables were screened using x2 test. In the second stage, factors that screened through P < 0.15 were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression, The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated from the final model. One hundred and four dogs met the inclusion criteria. Dogs of group 1 and 2 had a median survival longer than dogs of group 3, 1250 days (range 210\u20134380) and 913 days (range 61\u20133100) versus 210 days (range 30\u20132005), respectively. At univariate regression analysis, a statistical difference in dogs of group 3 with respect to dogs of group 1 and 2 in following variables, were observed: previous treatment with steroids; weight loss; prevalence of small bowel diarrhoea; decreased haematocrit, serum albumin, total protein, creatinine, cholesterol; increased concentration of aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); and received treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs than steroids at diagnosis. In multivariable model analysis previous treatment with steroids (OR = 5.47; 95%CI 1.86\u201316.11; P = 0.001) and decreased total proteins (OR = 12.5; 95%CI 3.62\u201341.75; P = 0.016) were independent variables associated with belonging to group 3.",

            "text": "Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NSDTR) dogs are predisposed to immune\u2010mediated disorders and particularly to a disorder characterized by chronic stiffness and pain from multiple joints, indicative of non\u2010erosive polyarthritis. Dogs affected by this disorder, called immune\u2010mediated rheumatic disease (IMRD), commonly display antinuclear antibodies (ANA) on indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Non\u2010erosive polyarthritis and ANA are commonly present in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in other systemic rheumatic diseases, in humans as well as in dogs. IMRD may be described as an SLE\u2010related disease. Diagnosis and monitoring of IMRD are primarily based on clinical signs and presence of ANA, and an objective, quick and cost\u2010effective test would be highly valuable. The acute phase protein C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) is used for diagnosing and monitoring systemic inflammation in both humans and dogs. It is considered to be a quantitative marker of inflammation in most diseases, but in human SLE, CRP concentrations are mildly to moderately increased and not correlated to the degree of inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate CRP concentrations in NSDTRs with IMRD. The hypothesis was that CRP concentrations would be mildly to moderately increased in IMRD compared to healthy dogs, similar to what has been reported in humans with SLE. Serum CRP concentrations were measured in 18 IMRD affected NSDTRs (9 IIF\u2010ANA positive and 9 IIF\u2010ANA negative) and 19 healthy control NSDTRs using two canine\u2010specific immunoturbidimetric assays (Gentian cCRP assay and high\u2010sensitivity CRP assay, Gentian AS, Moss, Norway). None of the dogs were treated with anti\u2010inflammatory medication at the time of sampling. Dogs with IMRD had higher CRP concentrations compared to control dogs (Welch two sample t\u2010test with log\u2010transformation of data, P = 0.003) but no difference was observed between the groups of IMRD dogs with and without positive IIF\u2010ANA, respectively (P = 0.6). The median CRP concentration was 10.3 mg/L in the IMRD dogs and 2.1 mg/L in the control dogs. The CRP concentration was low to moderately increased in a majority of IMRD dogs, as is seen in humans with SLE. The CRP concentration was lower than observed in, for example, studies of immune\u2010mediated polyarthritis in other dog breeds but higher than in canine osteoarthritis, two disorders that can resemble IMRD. The potential clinical value of CRP in dogs with IMRD warrants further investigations.",

The aims of this study were to non\u2010invasively quantify tidal breathing status in cats present with respiratory distress, and to compare the difference in ventilatory function between cats with respiratory distress and healthy cats. We hypothesized that ventilatory parameters such as respiratory rate and volumes will be elevated in cats experiencing significant labored breathing because of respiratory diseases and increase in ventilatory demand. Twelve cats present in NTUVH with persistently increased respiratory effort due to various etiologies (lung parenchymal disease, pleural space disease, upper airway obstruction, or lower airway disease) were enrolled in the study, and the informed consents were obtained from the owners. The cat was placed in a transparent Plexiglas chamber of the barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP) system without restraint for recording tidal breathing signals, and the breathing status of the cat could be observed easily by the clinicians at the same time without causing disturbance or stress to the cat. Compared with 14 cats without respiratory signs or historic respiratory diseases, cats in respiratory distress had significantly higher minute volume/body weight (MV/BW) (531.6 versus 234.5 mL/kg; P < 0.001), tidal volume/BW (TV/BW) (7.55 versus 5.46 mL/kg; P = 0.026), peak inspiratory flow/BW (PIF/BW) (29.2 versus 13.8 mL/s/kg; P < 0.001), peak expiratory flow/BW (PEF/BW) (35.2 versus 12.9 mL/s/kg; P < 0.001), enhanced pause (1.60 versus 1.00; P = 0.003), and significantly lower relaxation time (0.17 versus 0.36 s; P = 0.010). Among cats with respiratory distress, 5 cats that eventually died with respiratory failure had statistically higher MV/BW than 5 cats that survived and became stable over at least 3 months (639.0 versus 390.1; mL/kg) (P = 0.028). Interestingly, respiratory rate was neither significantly different between cats in respiratory distress and control cats, nor between cats that died and cats that survived. In conclusion, ventilatory function could be non\u2010invasively and non\u2010harmfully assessed in cats with respiratory distress by BWBP method. Elevation of MV/BW under natural breathing implies the increase in ventilatory demand and might be a poor prognostic indicator or severity index in cats with labored breathing. Furthermore, respiratory rate might not be reliable for identifying increased respiratory effort or disease severity. Care should be taken when the assessment relies on respiratory rate alone.",

            "text": "Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease mainly affecting old West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). CIPF shares several clinical and pathological features with human IPF. An imbalance between thrombosis and fibrinolysis has been demonstrated in human IPF patients favouring a local and systemic prothrombotic state which correlates with disease severity and outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems in CIPF. For this purpose, coagulation profile and thromboelastography data were collected and compared between WHWTs affected with CIPF and unaffected WHWTs (CTRL). Coagulation times (PT, aPTT), plasmatic concentrations of fibrinogen, D dimers, antithrombin III, Protein S and Protein C activities, anti\u2010factor Xa activity (FXa), and activated Protein C ratio (APCR) were retrospectively measured using the STA Compact automated coagulation analyzer from previously stored (\u221280\u00b0C) plasma samples obtained from 20 CTRL and 14 CIPF WHWTs. Point\u2010of\u2010care rotational thromboelastometer (ROTEM) was employed to prospectively measure clotting\u2010time, \u03b1\u2010angle, amplitude at 10/20/30 min, maximal clot firmness, lysis after 30/60 min, and maximum lysis on whole\u2010citrated blood sampled from 15 CTRL and 9 CIPF WHWTs. Satistical analyses were perfomed with a commercially available software using Student\u2010t test or Mann\u2010Withney test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at P \u2264 0.05. Compared with CTRL, WHWTs affected with CIPF demonstrated a longer aPTT (mean \u00b1 SD) (12.2 \u00b1 0.9 sec versus 11.5 \u00b1 0.7, P = 0.028), whereas results obtained in both groups were all within reference ranges. A trend for an increased fibrinogen concentration (4.1 \u00b1 1.8 g/L versus 3.1 \u00b1 1.1, P = 0.067) and for a decreased APCR (median, range) (25.6, 21.9\u201327.7 versus 26.8, 23.8\u201364.4) in WHWTs affected with CIPF was observed, while there was no siginificant difference between groups for the other factors assessed. FXa was found above the upper limit of the reference range in 3 WHWTs affected with CIPF, but in none of the controls (P = 0.075). ROTEM results demonstrated no significant difference between groups for any of the parameters studied. Results of the present study provide no clear evidence for a hypercoagulable state in WHWTs affected with CIPF. High fibrinogen concentrations found in CIPF WHWTs tend to suggest a proinflammatory state which may be a risk factor for thrombosis, but this finding should be confirmed by further investigation in larger cohorts of dogs.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ECT on tumor volume, mitotic index and microscopic necrosis in canine cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). This study included nine dogs referred to a veterinary hospital. Five patients had one lesion, three had two lesions, and one had four lesions. All the fifteen lesions were assessed. Tumor samples were taken before ECT (D0) and 21 days later (D21). ECT was accomplished by using the electroporator LC\u00ae BK\u2010100 model in association with intravenous bleomycin (15 UI/m\u00b2) plus doxorubicin (30 mg/m\u00b2) protocol. Tumor volume was calculated according to formula: length (cm) \u00d7 width (cm) \u00d7 height (cm) \u00d7 3.14/6. The mitotic index was determined by the number of mitotic figures in ten selected 40 \u00d7  high\u2010power fields. Microscopic necrosis was classified as \u201cabsent\u201d, grade I (less than 50%) or grade II (over 50%), as previously described. After testing for normality, the paired t\u2010test or the Mann\u2010Whitney test was applied to make the comparisons. The most common site of tumors was the abdomen (n = 10) and thorax (n = 3). One tumor occurred on the prepuce, and one was located on pelvic limb. After treatment, thirteen tumors presented clinical remission. One tumor progressed, and one remained stable in size. The mean of tumor volume in D0 (26.66 \u00b1 36.98) was higher than in D21 (18.07 \u00b1 33.06) (P = 0.0134). The mitotic index decreased in twelve lesions and increased in other three lesions. The mean of mitotic index in D0 (9 \u00b1 6.8) did not significantly differ from D21 (7.42 \u00b1 5.23) (P > 0.05). Before treatment, necrosis was classified as grade I in ten lesions and as grade II in four lesions. Necrosis was absent in one tumor. After ECT, the grade of necrosis did not change in most tumors (n = 12). One lesion decreased necrosis grade from II to I while other lesion decreased from I to \u201cabsent\u201d. One tumor that presented absence of necrosis in D0 was classified as grade I in D21. There was no significant difference between D0 and D21 for necrosis (P > 0.05). Although substantial tumor remissions, ECT does not significantly decreases mitotic index in SCC in dogs. Moreover, ECT does not influence the intensity of microscopic necrosis after 21 days from this procedure.",

            "text": "Adjunctive use of nutraceuticals to treat human cancers has shown promise, but little work has been done in canine neoplasia. Specifically, the multi\u2010modal effects of polyphenols and carotenoids have been established in human cell lines and rodent models, with limited work in canine cells. We have previously identified two natural ingredients, turmeric extract (TE) and rosemary extract (RE), which worked synergistically to reduce neoplastic cell growth, and had no cytotoxic effect on normal dermal fibroblasts. This combination had an additive or synergistic effect when used with the chemotherapeutic agents toceranib or doxorubicin hydrochloride. The purpose of this in\u2010vitro study was to examine mechanisms of action of this cocktail. Three canine neoplastic cell lines representing a variety of tumors were used: C2 (mastocytoma), CMT\u201012 (mammary gland carcinoma), and D17 (osteosarcoma). Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V staining and by a commercially available caspase\u20103/7 cleavage assay. Cell cycle changes using propidium iodide staining, generation of reactive oxygen species using Dihydrorhodamine123, modulation of cellular efflux pumps, and cellular accumulation of curcumin were analyzed by flow cytometry. Perturbation of various cell signaling pathways was assessed after 12 and 24 hours of incubation by western blotting. Cells were treated with 6.3 \u00b5g/mL of extract individually, a combination (3.1 \u00b5g/mL of each extract), or vehicle control. Comparisions between these four treatment groups were analyzed using a one\u2010way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post\u2010hoc analyses. The combination treatment induced apoptosis in all cell lines, beyond the effects of TE alone, after 36 hours of incubation. Both extracts had a significant antioxidant effect (P < 0.05). CMT\u201012 cells were the most susceptible to treatment (40% Annexin V positive; 5\u2010fold increase in caspase cleavage). The presence of RE significantly increased the cellular accumulation of TE as indicated by an increase in fluorescence, with the CMT\u201012 cell line showing the greatest accumulation. Western blotting showed an increase in the amount of activated c\u2010jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK), although the differences varied across cell lines. TE and RE interact synergistically to induce apoptosis in\u2010vitro; mechanisms may include RE increasing cellular accumulation of TE and activation of JNK. Considering the doses used in\u2010vitro may be physiologically achievable, in\u2010vivo studies are warranted to determine the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this dual treatment.",

A critical component of a successful weight loss regimen is a good estimate of body composition as the starting point to calculate an appropriate food amount for weight loss. The newly developed method called the Body Fat Index (BFI) differentiates between levels of obesity and establishes a link between the BFI and an ideal body weight. Dual\u2010Energy X\u2010ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) provides the most accurate way of measuring percent body fat; however, it is not readily available to the general practitioner. The current study compares percent body fat determined from the BFI chart and DEXA scan for a group of obese cats during weight loss and weight maintenance fed a food specifically formulated for helping cats achieve a healthy weight containing 11 g protein, 3.5 g fat, 3.6 g insoluble fiber, 0.6 g soluble fiber, and 14.9 mg L\u2010carnitine per 100 kilocalories. The protocol and procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.",
