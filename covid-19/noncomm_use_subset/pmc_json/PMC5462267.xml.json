While the majority of\nMERS-CoV cases have been reported in the Arabian Peninsula, several cases have been\nreported outside of the region. Most cases are believed to have been acquired in the\nMiddle East and then exported elsewhere, with no or rare instances of secondary\ntransmission. Two cases of MERS-CoV were exported to the United States and\nidentified in May 2014. One of these cases traveled from Saudi Arabia to\nFlorida.",
