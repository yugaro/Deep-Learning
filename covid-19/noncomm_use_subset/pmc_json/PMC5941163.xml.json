            "text": "Exposure to disasters is common worldwide, and individuals severely exposed to disasters, particularly artificial disasters, may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental disorders [1, 2]. Certain occupational factors and certain disaster characteristics are strongly associated with psychological distress among disaster responders [3\u20135]. The Great East-Japan Earthquake, accompanied by a huge Tsunami on 11 March 2011, was an unprecedented complex disaster that caused more than 18 000 deaths and missing people and was followed by the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP [6]. The nuclear accident had a large negative impact, and rebuilding of the community of Fukushima has been notably slow over the past 6 years. Although it has been reported that the level of additional external and internal radiation exposure from this nuclear accident was much lower than the minimum dose level that causes direct negative health effects [7],the residents\u2019 anxiety regarding radiation exposure and health risks is yet to be resolved [5]. A survey of public perception of radiation in Fukushima city conducted in May 2014 revealed that 70\u201380% of residents had experienced anxiety regarding the health risks of radiation exposure to themselves or their families following the nuclear accident [8]. It has been documented that the Three Mile Island NPP accident in the USA in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union in 1986 significantly influenced the residents mentally [9]. The decommissioning work at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP is expected to continue for a long time, and, as for the Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl accidents, health-care workers, especially public health nurses and hospital nurses, are often asked by the residents about the health risks of the radiation exposure after the disaster [10]. At the same time, the health-care workers are also residents who have their own concerns regarding radiation exposure and the health risks to themselves and their families, which tends to be a mental burden for them. Although the role of nurses in providing mental health care for disaster victims has been extensively studied, the mental health of the nurses themselves in a disaster area has not been sufficiently considered [11\u201313]. As shown in Table 1, there are a few studies focusing on the mental health of nurses in disaster zones [3, 13\u201315]. In this review, we looked at the factors affecting mental health and the narrative stories describing resilience in nurses working in the face of disaster, also reviewing the mental health\u2013related findings for residents who experienced the Fukushima disaster or similar disasters, such as atomic bomb.\n",

Because patients with severe disease could not be moved, but had to remain in the hospital, hospital staff had to prepare for recurrence of tsunamis while treating emergency patients [16]. On the day after the disaster, evacuation instructions were given to residents within a 10-km radius of the nuclear power plant. There was no specific information as to why an evacuation was necessary, or where or how to evacuate; however, instructions to initiate evacuation had been given. Several people directly heard the sound of the explosion of the nuclear power plant [17]. When they became aware of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP, they felt even more anxious. The patients and hospital staff were forced to evacuate by separating into separate groups using relief buses and helicopters. Furthermore, they did not know where they would be evacuated to, and it took more than one week to confirm the safety of patients and hospital staff and also that of their families.",

Voluntary evacuation of the residents began 3 days after the explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP and peaked after one week. Some nurses tried to go back to work, but their families strongly opposed them. A hospital more than 60 km away from the nuclear power plant was partially destroyed and tried to discharge the patients due to the frequent aftershocks [18]. The hospital accepted patients from the evacuation area. Nurses continued to work in three shifts around the clock, although they were having difficulty commuting because of a gasoline shortage. Another nurse in the non-evacuated area evacuated her children to another prefecture where relatives lived; however, she stayed back [18]. While she experienced a strong sense of guilt as a parent, she was firm in her decision based on her professional mission statement. Conversely, some nurses decided to temporarily evacuate the area with their families just after the nuclear accident occurred; they often found it difficult to return to work owing to feelings of guilt. Many suffered from the dilemma in deciding between their responsibilities as nurses and in securing their families\u2019 relief. They felt a feeling of guilt, regardless of the choice they made.",

However, soon after the earthquake, the water supply was cut off, causing problems with dialysis, examinations, sterilization, and cooking by the hospital food service. Furthermore, information on the potential crisis at the nuclear power plant caused great unrest in the staff. Staff anxiety was further exacerbated because water and electric current supplies were cut off at home as well as at the hospital, and securing food and gasoline was difficult. They helped each other, bringing rice and other food from home wherever possible, and commuting by car-pooling. When the earthquake occurred, Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) arrived at the affected hospitals from all over Japan. However, the DMATs withdrew 4 days after the earthquake from Fukushima prefecture owing to the possibility that the NPP accident has deteriorated. The DMAT withdrawals increased anxiety and fostered unease among the local staff [20]. The fact that a few medical teams continued their support as networks of radiation emergency medicine became a very valuable communication link in a time of crisis.",

While radiation cannot be felt through the five physical senses, atomic bomb survivors reported that they felt a flash of radiation [22]. They reported being often scared of the sounds of thunder and airplane flight and sometimes closed their eyes and turned the lights on and off because of their memory of flashing lights\u2014all symptoms of suspected PTSD. If people had directly heard the explosive sounds of the nuclear power plant, it could be expected that they would be vulnerable to PTSD onset. Although relatively few people reported similar experiences after the 2011 nuclear accident, PTSD-like symptoms did seed to be more frequent even those without such experiences, indicating high-risk trauma had been experienced by >30% of residents, based on the results of the Fukushima Health Management Survey [23]. Furthermore, subjects with a high traumatic symptom score reportedly have a tendency toward poor mental health [24].",

Following the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster, staff shortage at hospitals (53% shortage of total staff and 52% shortage of nurses) reached a maximum within one month in disaster-affected areas [28]. In a survey targeting nurses working at a university hospital conducted 2 years after the disaster, several nurses had considered leaving their jobs because of \u2018anxiety about life after the accident,\u2019 \u2018possible radiation health effects in children,\u2019 and \u2018anxiety about relationships with colleagues in the hospital\u2019 [14]. In addition, in our survey [13], several nurses were also concerned about radiological contamination of foods, health effects on their children rather than on themselves, and evacuation requirements. Although they have some knowledge regarding radiation, some were anxious about the health risks of radiation exposure, whereas others were not, indicating that anxiety about radiation exposure varies widelyfrom person to person.",

Feelings of isolation were also described during an infectious disease outbreak [29]. There are some common factors in relation to feelings of isolation found in medical staff involved in a radiation disaster and those involved in an outbreak, for example, seclusion with patients, protection clothing, and a risk perception of radioactive contamination or infection. Meanwhile, in the description of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, feelings of isolation were greatly alleviated by the aid of supporters, relief supplies, and timely donations. Many disaster victims did not doubt that relief would be provided in due course, enabling them to remain relatively calm and relieved [30, 31]. In designated evacuation areas for disasters, especially nuclear disasters, business continuity around the area experiences physical damage as well as lack of human resources [6, 32]. In addition, the safety of dispatched staff needs to be ensured during disaster medical assistance; however, it is very important to support victims so that they do not feel abandoned during the emergency.",

Ben-Ezra et al. compared the reactions of hospital nurses (n = 34) and civilians (n = 39) after this disaster, using a brief questionnaire [43]. This preliminary study suggested that nurses had a lower level of PTSD symptoms, but higher self-rated health, life satisfaction, and perceived coping, and a similar level of fear about radiation to that of civilians. Sakuma et al. also reported that the prevalence of high general psychological distress (K6 score) was higher among medical workers [mostly hospital nurses (14.5%)] and municipality officers (14.9%) than among firefighters (2.6%) at about one year after the Great East-Japan Earthquake in the coast area of Miyagi prefecture affected by the tsunami [5].",

The mean GHQ-12 value was 3.96 (SD 3.27), the mode was 2, and the median was 3. This result was higher than the mean GHQ-12 value of 1.91 in a survey by a general corporation not affected by disaster [15]. However, the mean score and the proportion of the high-risk group were 5.42 and 68.8%, respectively, in nurses from eight Japanese tertiary care hospitals [27]. These results suggested that nursing is a stressful occupation, even in peacetime, compared with other occupations. Compared with other disasters, the mean GHQ-12 score was 3.6 in evacuees of the Niigata\u2013Chuetsu Earthquake [44], and 45.1% of nurses who provided SARS medical care were in the high-risk group [45]. These data are summarized in Table 1. Nurses who have been exposed to extremely high stress after the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident have the same level of mental health risk compared with that found previous studies, and it seems that the nurses acquired some resilience over the 4-year period after the disaster.",

In addition, the greater the knowledge of radiation, the better the mental health observed. It is possible that increased knowledge regarding radiation will reduce anxiety of radiation, suggesting the importance of radiation health risk education for health-care professionals especially from the acute to subacute period of disasters [14, 37, 48]. During the chronic phase of a disaster, work and daily burdens were more influential on mental health than anxiety about radiation; hence, mental health care for nurses should be considered, independent of concerns of radiation (Fig. 1). It is particularly important to address the mental health care of nurses through comprehensive approaches during the chronic phase of a disaster.",
