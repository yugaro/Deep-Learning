            "text": "A particular group of human neurological disorders is associated with expansions of simple repetitive elements within specific genes. This class comprises more than 20 diseases, which have been categorized into coding and noncoding repeat expansion disorders depending on the genetic location of their causative mutations (1\u20133). The toxicity of the coding repeats located within ATG-initiated open reading frames (ORFs) is typically governed via a protein gain-of-function mechanism. This mode of repeat toxicity is found in numerous disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), in which the expression of exonic CAG repeat expansions gives rise to polyglutamine (polyGln)-rich proteins that adversely affect various cellular functions (3). However, the toxicity of coding CAG repeats can also be exerted on the transcript level via an RNA gain-of-function mechanism that was initially described for the noncoding repeat expansion disorder myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (4\u20138). Also Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), SCA31, SCA10, SCA8 and, most recently, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD) have been shown to exhibit toxicity via a mutant transcript gain-of-function mechanism. In these diseases, the expression of transcripts harboring expansions of particular repeats leads to the formation of nuclear RNA foci that sequester specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in a loss of their normal function (9\u201311).",

The discovery of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, which indicates that noncoding diseases could involve unexplored yet toxic proteins and that coding diseases are likely to produce unexpected proteins in other frames, has proven how inscrutable these diseases remain. Importantly, novel proteins have been found to accumulate in the relevant tissues of the diseases in both patients and model organisms, suggesting that homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation products might play a role in microsatellite expansion disorders. Nevertheless, their precise contribution to the process of pathogenesis of SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and C9ALS/FTD remains to be determined.",

The cap-dependent scanning mechanism and cap-independent internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mechanisms are the best known types of translation initiation (23,24); however, other initiation mechanisms such as leaky scanning, ribosome shunting or reinitiation are also known (25). The fact that microsatellite expansions do not follow the canonical rules of translation initiation and generate series of homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) in multiple frames indicates the involvement of a novel yet unrecognized process or the altered utilization of known processes. RNA structures formed by the repeats must be considered when deciphering mechanisms of RAN translation because their formation and stability have been shown to affect the abundance of RAN translation products (14). Could such structures be used to trigger an IRES type of mechanism? Could IRES translation-associated factors (ITAFs) that normally help to stabilize RNA structures be more abundant at repeat-formed structures, allowing translation initiation without an AUG start codon? Could alternative start codons occurring within or in close proximity to these repeats permit the noncanonical initiation of protein production? These questions and many others arise when dissecting the novel ambiguity of expanded repeats.",

Frameshifting by one nucleotide downstream or one nucleotide upstream during translation across elongated CAG repeats of ATXN3 and HTT transcripts results in the generation of new proteins containing polyAla (SCA3 and HD) and polySer (HD) (26\u201330). Such ribosome slippage occurs probably at random positions along the expanded CAG repeats in tissues and cells, and what initiates the process remains unknown. Nonetheless, the frequency of frameshifting increases with the number of CAG repeats and seems to depend on the formation of hairpin structures by the repeats. The resulting chimeric mutant proteins accumulate in intranuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that are toxic on the cellular level, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA3 and HD (26,28,30).",

Homoaminoacid RAN translation proteins were expressed in two of three possible reading frames: polyglycine (polyGly) from the GGC repeat frame and polyAla from the GCG frame, while no polyarginine (polyArg) was detected from the reading frame with CGG repeats. Different abundances of these proteins, i.e. predominance of polyGly and an inability to detect polyArg, may reflect a large difference in the initiation frequency in different frames, preferential drop-off of nascent polyArg peptide or alternatively, large differences in cellular stability of polypeptides that were synthesized in different frames.",

The efficiency of the C9 RAN translation is length-dependent with respect to the hexanucleotide repeats, being more efficient for longer repeats (15,17,22,32). Mori et al. has demonstrated the expression of sense strand-derived DPRs in HEK293T cells, and polyGlyAla was expressed from constructs harboring \u223c38 G4C2 repeats. PolyGlyPro was found when the repeat length was extended to 145, whereas no polyGlyArg DPRs were detected from constructs with 11 to 145 G4C2 repeats (Supplementary Figure S1) (19). The Ranum group reported that all three DPRs are detectable in HEK293T cells transfected with constructs of only 30 G4C2 repeats; however, their expression becomes more abundant with 60 and 120 repeats (15).",

In DM1, inclusions of RAN-translation products formed nuclear polyGln aggregates that are detected in patients\u2019 blood at higher frequency than in myoblasts and skeletal muscle; in DM1 transgenic mice, such inclusions are more abundant in leukocytes than in cardiac myocytes (14). In FXTAS patients, RAN-translated products were found to form Gly-positive inclusions that accumulate in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex, whereas in a mouse model of the disease, polyGly aggregated in the hypothalamus, cortex and brainstem (16). Interestingly, in FXTAS, these inclusions were ubiquitin-positive. Although in SCA8 and DM1, only the most expressed RAN-translation products were found to aggregate, in C9ALS/FTD, all possible DRPs from either sense or antisense transcripts have been detected in inclusions that exhibit dot-like and star-like shapes (Supplementary Table S2). DPRs were present in the patient tissues and in cells of C9ALS/FTD experimental models and were restricted to neurons, being highly abundant in neocortical regions, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, more variable in the striatum and substantia nigra and rare or absent in the medulla and spinal cord (15,17\u201319,22,31\u201333,36,37).

            "text": "The discovery of RAN translation may challenge the common dogma that the toxicity of noncoding repeat disorders is exclusively caused by mutant transcripts. What are the arguments indicating that RAN-translated products are relevant or irrelevant to neurodegeneration? The majority of data against the toxicity of RAN proteins originate from work on C9ALS/FTD. First, no correlation between the neuroanatomical distribution of DPR inclusions and the degree of degeneration in different regions of the central nervous system in C9ALS/FTD was reported (32), and tissues containing DPRs showed no signs of cell loss or other apparent symptoms of neurodegeneration (31). Second, RAN translation-related pathology was less frequently detected or absent in lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, the area affected in ALS (15,22,32). However, as suggested, this result may be a consequence of increased cell death and atrophy in this region, resulting in a reduced number of cells available for analysis. Additionally, the levels of RAN-translated proteins and their capacity to form aggregates may be lower in the spinal cord (15), or even not observed in iPSC-derived motor neurons (38). Third, despite the outstay of RAN-translated proteins, the toxic phenotype of human C9ORF72 iPSC-derived neurons was rescued upon antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment (20). As reported by Donnelly et al., treatment of these cells with ASO efficiently abrogated known pathogenic features of C9ALS/FTD, such as intranuclear G4C2 repeat RNA foci formation, ADARB2 protein sequestration, deregulated gene expression and susceptibility to glutamate toxicity; however, this treatment did not affect the level of the polyGlyPro dipeptide.",

Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the colocalization of caspase-8, an early indicator of apoptosis, with polyGln aggregates in the skeletal muscles of DM1 patients and in leukocytes from DM1 mice. Enhanced cell death was also observed in mammalian HEK293T cells transfected with G4C2 constructs expressing polyProArg and polyGlyPro proteins (14) and in COS7 cells transfected with FXTAS CGG repeat plasmids expressing the polyGly protein (16). Additionally, in a Drosophila model of FXTAS, the presence of the RAN-translated polyGly protein was accompanied by rough-eye phenotype, which is a manifestation of toxicity in flies (16).",

The complex proceeds in a 3\u2032 direction until it encounters the first AUG codon in a Kozak consensus sequence (24). These canonical rules seem not to apply to RAN translation, and it currently remains unclear what forces the synthesis of homoproteins by ribosome and exactly where the process starts. One hypothesized trigger is an RNA structure formed by the repeats that, in fact, features in all RAN-translated sequences reported thus far (Figure 1). As described, the hairpin structure-forming CAG repeats are efficiently RAN translated, in contrast to CAA repeats that do not form hairpins (14). CGG repeats of the FMR1 transcript are also RAN translated; these repeats form hairpins (44) that are able to fold into G-quadruplex structures under specific conditions (45,46). The sense G4C2 repeats of C9ALS/FTD also fold into G-quadruplexes that are not detected at the antisense C4G2 repeats of the C9, which, however, may fold into hairpins (47). As these structures show different stability, and because hairpins are less stable than G-quadruplexes, this phenomenon may affect the expression levels of RAN-translation products and their variety from repeat-harboring transcripts (15,17,19).",

            "text": "Because the precise involvement of RNA structures in RAN translation needs further investigation, the question has arisen whether these repeat sequences act as IRES to initiate RAN translation via a cap-independent mechanism. Such a scenario was suggested because hairpin- and G-quadruplex-forming repeats might mimic IRES structures, and the 5\u2032 region preceding the CGG repeats of the FMR1 transcript had previously been identified to function as an IRES and a site of ribosome pausing (48). Based on such factors as dependence on canonical eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), the proposed secondary structure, start codon localization and ability of the IRES to function in a cell-free system with or without supplementation, known viral IRES were divided into four groups. Initiation on types I and II typically requires most canonical initiation factors including eIF3, eIF4A and the C-terminal domain of eIF4G in addition to the eIF2-Met-tRNAiMet-GTP ternary complex. In contrast, type III IRES directly attach the 43S complex to the initiation codon independently of eIF4F, eIF4B, eIF1 and eIF1, whereas type IV IRES initiate without eIFs or Met-tRNAiMet (49,50). Of the four known IRES-initiated translation mechanisms used by viruses, only type IV is both cap-independent and AUG-independent and thus could explain certain features of RAN translation initiation. The three other types of viral IRES mechanisms require an AUG codon and thus fail to explain why RAN translation produces proteins in multiple frames. With all these uncertainties, it seems that an alternative, as yet unknown mechanism may govern translation initiation at expanded RNA repeats.",

For CAG repeats in SCA8, RAN translation in the polyGln frame initiates at or near the start of the repeats, independently of an upstream AUG codon, whereas in the GCA frame encoding polyAla, it initiates at various sites throughout the length of the repeats (14). For CGG repeats in FXTAS, this atypical translation was shown to start between the 21st and 12th nucleotide 5\u2032 of the repeats for the polyGly reading frame, was sensitive to stop codons when placed just proximal to the repeats and required an upstream AUG-like codon such as GUG. By contrast, polyAla formation arose independently of AUG-like codons and was insensitive to stop codon insertion 5\u2032 of the repeats (16). For G4C2 hexanucleotides in C9ALS/FTD, the exact start of RAN translation is also unknown, but its termination does not necessarily occur on the repeats. As it has been demonstrated for polyGlyAla and polyGlyArg frames, at least a fraction of RAN translation products are extended beyond the repeats into the 3\u2032 region (22). Consequently, the length of some RAN-translated proteins may depend on the position of the stop codon in a particular frame.",

In this system, the products of RAN translation in the polyGln frame, which were abundant in the SCA8 context, were expressed at lower levels in the HD, HDL2, SCA3 and DM1 sequence contexts. In addition, the process of RAN translation of these constructs appeared to be less prevalent when studied in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, indicating specific protein requirements. When tested in a noncellular environment, RAN translation was also shown to be sensitive to the presence of alternative start codons (14).

Their formation and stability affect the abundance of RAN-translated products. For longer repeats that have a more stable RNA structure, increased RAN-translated protein levels were detected (14,51). It is known that repeats that undergo RAN translation can form hairpin or G-quadruplex structures, which have different molecular architecture and stability (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). Our previous in vitro analysis of RNA structures formed by different triplet motifs revealed the following order of hairpin stability: CGG > CAG > CUG > CCG (52). The crystallographic structures of CNG repeat duplexes (N = A,U,G,C) showed distortions of their double-stranded helices caused by noncanonical N\u2013N base pairs, implying both similarities and differences in protein binding by repeat hairpins (53\u201355). In addition, we have demonstrated that in certain repeat containing transcripts, e.g. HTT/HD, AR/SBMA and CACNA1/SCA6, the repeat flanking sequences may contribute to hairpin stability (56). Additionally, the presence of interruptions in repeat tracts strongly influences the stability of the hairpin structure they adopt (57). Could such properties determine RAN translation process intensity in different disease models? The available data show differences in RAN translation efficiency between the C9ORF72 antisense and sense transcripts, in which C4G2 repeats adopt hairpin structures, whereas G4C2 repeats may also fold into more stable G-quadruplex structures (47). The intramolecular G-quadruplexes are adopted by RNA motifs having the following consensuses sequence G3+N1\u22127G3+N1\u22127G3+N1\u22127G3+ (N represent any nucleotide, 3+ means 3 and more and 1\u22127 means number ranging from 1 to 7). The stability of these structures depends on several factors including the presence of potassium ions, number of consecutive guanines and separating nucleotides between G-tracts (58,59). Thus RAN translation from the latter transcript adopting G-quadruplex structure seems to be more robust (15,17,22). For this same reason, normal CGG repeats of sense FMR1 transcripts might undergo the noncanonical translation that typically occurs on expanded repeats. Interestingly, the presence of a G-quadruplex in the 5\u2032UTRs was demonstrated to impair cap-dependent translation, promoting cap-independent translation, as G-quadruplexes were revealed to be structural components of some human IRES sequences (60).",

Our in silico structure prediction of expanded repeats along with their flanking regions (Figure 1) revealed the presence of modifying factors that may potentially stimulate or inhibit RAN translation. The stimulatory factors may include additional hairpin stabilization by repeat flanking sequences (e.g. additional extension of (CGG)n hairpin by S-FMR1 flanking sequences (Figure 1b)), AUG START codons and various AUG-like codons (CUG, GUG, UUG, AUA, ACG and AUU which differ from AUG by a single base only (61)). Whereas inhibitory factors may comprise STOP codons (UAG, UAA, UGA) in different reading frames. How significant is the presence of alternative START codons for RAN translation initiation, and do STOP codons that may abolish the influence of AUG-like codons in the same frame play a role? These sequences were found to occur with different frequencies in the analyzed transcripts, and their relation to RAN translation efficiency should be carefully examined. At first glance, in the sense C9 transcript, an alternative START codon upstream of the G4C2 repeats that is not followed by STOP in the polyGlyAla frame (Figure 1c) does not affect the abundance of RAN proteins in this frame (15). Similarly, a STOP codon located directly before the G4C2 repeats in the polyGlyPro frame does not seem to disturb protein expression in this frame. In the antisense C9 transcript, we found only one AUG-like codon in close proximity to the hexanucleotide repeats (Figure 1d), but two additional start codons are present >100 nt upstream of the repeats (15). Despite these differences in the frequency of potential stimulatory and inhibitory factors of RAN translation, both sense and antisense C9 transcripts undergo RAN translation; however, the intensity of this phenomenon is higher for the sense transcript (15,17,22).",

These results suggest that other transcripts with expanded and structure-forming repeats may also be subject to RAN translation.",

            "text": "Canonical translation initiation is a complex process requiring more than ten initiation factors (Figure 2) (23,24). However, under certain cellular conditions such as viral infection, protein synthesis might be switched to another mode and proceed with minimal involvement of the translation machinery (62). Depending on the mode of RAN translation initiation, different sets of protein factors may be involved (Figure 2). In a cap-dependent scanning mechanism, the utilization of a full set of initiation machinery might be perturbed when the scanning ribosome stalls at a highly structured obstacle of expanded repeats with bound proteins (Figure 2a). Because this stalling could force the scanning ribosome to pause, various proteins attached to structured RNA and proteins of the scanning complex might be rearranged, triggering noncanonical translation initiation at non-AUG codons. It is plausible that such perturbation could involve the eIF1 initiation factors, including eIF1A, which plays a critical role in the fidelity of start codon selection (23,24). Another candidate to consider is eIF2, whose function is to deliver Met-tRNAiMet to the ribosome. There is evidence of eIF2-independent translation under stress conditions (63\u201367). As reported, RAN translation does not require an AUG codon, which implies that tRNAs charged with amino acids other than methionine are involved in translation initiation (14). Moreover, one of the translation initiation factors, eIF2D, can direct tRNAPhe to the P-site of the ribosome to initiate translation (65). A distinct set of proteins may be considered in the context of direct recruitment of the ribosome to structures formed by the expanded repeats (Figure 2b). One possible scenario is that the structured expanded repeats bind the small ribosomal subunit in the absence of initiation factors, but RAN translation still requires eIF3 and eIF2-GTP for initiation, as shown for viral IRES type III (49,50). Another scenario involves the steps and factors described for viral IRES type IV (49,50), in which RAN protein synthesis is initiated with minimal involvement of the translation machinery, assuming that the structures formed by expanded repeats are tightly folded and structurally mimic the missing initiation factors. In contrast to viral IRES, their cellular counterparts are less understood, more diverse in their structure and less stable (67). Taken together, the available data remain insufficient to answer the question of whether IRES mechanisms are indeed involved in RAN translation.",

In the case of HD, frameshift products that contain polyAla or polySer tracts were observed in postmortem brains of HD patients and in transgenic HD mice (HD\u2010N171\u2010N82Q) (29). Only polyAla-containing proteins were observed in other studies where two different cell lines, neuroblastoma N2a and epithelial HeLa cells, were transfected with the CAG repeat of Htt exon 1 (Supplementary Table S3) (30). Immunodetection with specific C-terminal antibodies accompanied by Western blotting was mostly used to detect abnormal SCA3 proteins. In the case of HD, valuable information concerning the mechanism of frameshifting was also obtained with the use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) (30). Frameshifting occurred with an equal stochastic probability at any CAG codon within the expanded CAG repeat, giving rise to proteins with various hybrid polyGln/polyAla stretches (30). As shown by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, frameshifted proteins formed in N2a cells expressing Htt51Q contained Gln:Ala ratios ranging from Gln1:Ala49 to Gln48:Ala2 in their repeat tract. This finding indicates that a (\u22121) frameshift can occur at any CAG codon within the CAG stretch, and its frequency is modulated by the number of CAG codons to be translated (30).",

Consistent with these data, Stochmanski et al. determined that in a Drosophila model of SCA3, replacing the CAG92 repeat tract with CAA96 eliminated overt phenotypic anomalies that were characterized by disruption of morphology and pigmentation of the eyes (28).

The presence of a transgene expressing the polyAla tract without the context of the ataxin-3 protein is sufficient for aggregate formation, which produces a toxic phenotype. It has been shown that (\u22121) frameshifting events and the concomitant production of polyAla-containing ataxin-3 are key factors that contribute to toxic eye phenotype development, as observed in the Drosophila model of SCA3.

Previously, both polySer- and polyAla\u2010containing proteins were shown to be modifiers of mutant huntingtin toxicity (79). It was also proposed that translational frameshifting within expanded CAG stretches may contribute to the observed variations in HD course and onset, leading to cell-selective neurotoxicity on both the cellular and organismal levels. This phenomenon could at least partially account for the degeneration of selective neuronal populations in patients, although the disease-related polyQ proteins are widely expressed. Furthermore, tissue-specific variations in polyQ length may contribute to cell-selective pathogenesis because the CAG stretch is several repeats longer in the brain than in other tissues even within a single individual (80,81), and the frequency of frameshifting increases with repeat length. Taken together, frameshifted proteins are important factors that contribute to polyGln aggregate toxicity.",

            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a common mechanism that increases the protein-coding capacity of small genomes such as viruses and mitochondria. Frameshifting events were also observed in the case of some mammalian genes (82,83). Three elements within mRNA have been shown to be required for the efficient induction of (\u22121) PRF: a 7-nt slippery sequence (84), a short 5\u201312 nt spacer and a stimulatory structure that can be a pseudoknot, hairpin structure, G-quadruplex (85\u201389) or mRNA duplex formed with the antisense oligonucleotide (90). The nature of the slippery sequence facilitates slippage of the tRNAs within the P and A sites on the mRNA, whereas the stimulatory structure provides an energetic barrier that causes an elongating ribosome to pause on the slippery sequence. Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of (\u22121) PRF (91\u201394), and it seems that structural elements of mRNA play an important role in this process, e.g. the stability of the first 3 or 4 bp at the base of the hairpin stem was shown to be critical for shifting the ribosome by these structures (87,95). Jacks et al. proposed \u2018the two tRNA simultaneous slippage model,\u2019 in which the shift occurs after delivery of the aa-tRNA to the A site but before peptidyl transfer (91). A downstream stimulatory motif inhibits the EF2-driven movement of the ribosome. The resulting tension is relieved by unpairing of the aa-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNAs from the mRNA, slipping of the mRNA by one base and re-pairing of the tRNAs in the (\u22121) frame (91,92,96). A second model proposed by Weiss et al. assumes that (\u22121) PRF occurs during the translocation step (85,97). Briefly, after peptide bond formation, the deacetylated-tRNA and the peptidyl-tRNAs occupy, respectively, the P/E and A/P sites. They can unpair from the mRNA due to the physical barrier formed by the stimulatory structure, move, and re-pair in the new reading frame. In the third model, the (\u22121) PRF is triggered by incomplete translocation and depends on the interactions of tRNAs with the A, P and E sites on the ribosome (93).",

            "text": "It remains to be established whether frameshifting on CAG repeats results from an incomplete 2-base translocation event ((+2) frameshifting) or ribosome slippage by one base in the 5\u2032 direction ((\u22121) frameshifting). Both these processes generate the same GCA frame encoding alanine; however, different nomenclature used by the authors may be confusing. Because frameshifting has been shown to occur in both SCA3 and HD, the most straightforward explanation is that the CAG repeat sequences of, respectively, ATXN3 and HTT are particularly susceptible to such repositions of reading frames, as experimental evidence demonstrated a higher frequency of frameshifting on longer repeats of both transcripts (26,28\u201330). However, as the structural requirements of RNA that induce frameshifting are not sufficiently known, it seems plausible that the hairpin structures formed by elongated CAG repeats of ATXN3 and HTT (Figure 3) (98\u2013100) may serve as frameshifting stimulatory sequences, leading to ribosome pausing (Figure 4). Pseudoknots are a common type of stimulatory motif, but hairpin structures are also used by some viruses, e.g. HIV-1 (101,102). During translation elongation on expanded CAG repeat tracts, multiple hairpin structures may fold and unfold by moving the ribosomal complex. In investigating mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting within repeated sequences, it would be interesting to determine whether the influence of CAA interruptions which are known to alter structure of CAG repeat hairpins (57) affects the frameshifting frequency.",

Is it possible that CAG repeats themselves act as unusual slippery sequences? Viral slippery sequences composed of the heptameric motif N NNW WWH (IUPAC) enable repairing of the nonwobble bases of both the aa-tRNAs and peptidyl-tRNAs with the (\u22121) codons (104). In light of this fact, it remains a mystery what factors would help to maintain interactions between the frameshifted 5\u2032GCA3\u2032 codon and the 5\u2032CUG3\u2032 anticodon, where no Watson\u2013Crick pairs would be possible (Figure 4) (103).",

            "text": "Recently, new experimental evidence on the mechanism of frameshifting at expanded CAG repeats has been published (30). The formation of various transframe-encoded species generated via frameshifting at long CAG repeats in HD is proposed to be a consequence of a depletion of the charged glutaminyl-transfer RNA tRNAGln-CUG that pairs exclusively with the CAG codons. It has been shown that the amount of tRNAGln decreases with increasing length of the encoded CAG sequences (hungry codons), and in N2A cells expressing 65 or 103 CAG repeats, a significant increase in the frequency of frameshifting was observed from, respectively, 60 to 80%. Moreover, the frameshifting frequency varies among different cell lines. In N2a cells and HeLa cells, which differ in their intrinsic concentration of tRNAGln-CUG, the higher frameshifting frequency occurs in the N2a cells, which have a lower amount of tRNAGln-CUG than the HeLa cell line (Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the concentration of tRNAGln-CUG also differs among different brain areas, and as shown in HD mice, the tRNAGln-CUG concentration is lower in the striatal and hippocampal tissues than in the cortical and cerebellar regions (30). This fact raises the interesting question of whether tRNAGln-CUG levels also vary among different brain tissues in HD patients, thus contributing to the cell-selective pathology of the disease. Because the most prominent early effects in HD have been observed in the striatum, even though striatal neurons do not selectively express higher levels of HTT mRNA (105), this possibility could provide a mechanistic explanation of the selective pathology and importantly disclose a new therapeutic target. However, this issue remains to be examined.",

Certain SEPs have a regulatory function and affect protein expression by controlling translation re-initiation at downstream initiation codons and by activating the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (113). On the other hand, various cryptic peptides, products of alternative translation initiation, act as alternative sources of antigens for major histocompatibility complex class I components (114,115).

Each panel (a\u2013e) shows the structure for a transcript with expanded repeats, its orientation (S-sense, AS-antisense) and the number of repeats identified in affected patients: (a) DMPK/DM1, (b) FMR1/FXTAS, (c) and (d) C9ORF72/ALS/FTD and (e) ATXN8/SCA8. Structures were modeled in silico with RNAmetaserver and visualized by Varna software. The modeling was performed for transcripts with 150 repeated nucleotides (50\u00d7 trinucleotide and 25\u00d7 hexanucleotide motifs) and, to obtain more relevant results, in two variants of the flanking sequence 200 and 100 nt each side. For figure clarity, we have shortened the hairpins formed by the expanded repeats, as well as the flanking sequence, to \u223c50 nt of 5\u2032 flank. In each panel (a\u2013e), the repeat locations within the affected gene are indicated (red box). As indicated in the figure legend, different AUG-like alternative start codons and STOP codons are marked in the sequence preceding the repeats. In (b) and (c), despite the hairpin structure, the repeats may form G-quadruplexes. *\u2014Indicates neither ATXN8 nor ATXN8OS contain a conventional ORF.",

            "text": "Figure 2.: Speculated Mechanisms of RAN Translation Initiation. There are at least two translation initiation mechanisms: a canonical cap-dependent mechanism described in Eukaryotes and a cap-independent type IV IRES-dependent mechanism described in Dicistroviridae viruses. In the cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation, the initiator tRNA is delivered to the ribosome as a ternary complex with eIF2 and GTP, and then, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5 and eIF3 initiation factors promote binding to form a 43S pre-initiation complex. This complex binds to the mRNA through its interaction with the cap-binding complex, which consists of eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF4B factors, and begins scanning for the start codon. In cap-independent/IRES-dependent translation initiation, highly structured type IV IRES, which does not require initiation factors, operates essentially as an all RNA-based ribosome recruitment apparatus; the IRES position of pseudoknot I mimics the initiator tRNA codon/anti-codon interaction that results in an initiation at the non-AUG codon. This type of translation initiation requires the interaction between IRES and ribosomal proteins RPS25 and RPS5. RAN translation is initiated by repeat-forming RNA structures. These structures could bind various proteins, including specific repeat binding proteins, translation initiation factors and other regulatory proteins. The riboprotein complex may resemble a translation initiation unit and trigger translation initiation in the absence of an AUG start codon. Thus, RAN translation might occur via a cap-dependent scanning mechanism (a) and/or as a result of IRES-like ribosome recruitment (b). In (a), the scanning ribosome approaches a repeat hairpin that results in the stalling of the pre-initiation complex. This forces an unspecific interaction between hairpin proteins and the pre-initiation complex and/or dissociation of some translation initiation factors that may result in noncanonical translation initiation at non-AUG codons. In (b), a direct recruitment of the ribosome to hairpin-associated protein complex results in unspecific translation initiation, similar to what is proposed in (a), with the use of codons other than AUG.",

            "text": "Figure 4.: Speculated mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting at CAG repeats in SCA3 and HD. Translation elongation is a cyclic process of mRNA-dependent peptide bond formation with the use of ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNAs, energy and specific protein factors. At the start of each cycle, the complex of correct aminoacyl-tRNA and the elongation factor eEF-1AGTP are positioned in the ribosome decoding center (A site). (a) During this step, the ribosome P site binds the initiator Met-tRNA or peptidyl-tRNA. After codon recognition, followed by GTP hydrolysis, the amino acid from aminoacyl-tRNAs is transferred to the C-terminus of the growing polypeptide chain. (b) The reaction leaves an uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal P site and the new peptidyl-tRNA in the A site. Normally, during the next step, the ribosome translocates one codon forward on the mRNA, and deacylated tRNA is released from the exit (E) site of the ribosome. During translation elongation of expanded CAG-containing transcripts, the ribosomal complex may pause on the hairpin structure formed by the elongated CAG repeat tract. Accommodation of aa-tRNA may pull the downstream mRNA into the ribosome, thus creating tension between the hairpin and slippery site. This leads to the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA and repairs mRNA in the (\u22121) frame (GCA). (c) The weak interaction between the codon-anticodon GCA:CUG may result in peptidyl-tRNA drop off. (d) After unwinding of the hairpin, elongation proceeds in a new frame. (e) An increased demand for glutaminyl-tRNAGln-CUG may be the additional factor that stimulates changes in the reading frame. * - refolding hairpin.",
