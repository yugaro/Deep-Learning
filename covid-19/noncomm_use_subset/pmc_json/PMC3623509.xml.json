With the birth of Korean Vaccine Society (KVS) in 2012, the first annual conference was held, and as a following step, an official journal, \"Clinical and Experimental Vaccine Research\" is being now published. I am honored to be selected to write a review article in the subject of the history of vaccination and current vaccination policies in South Korea. I would like to note not all references may be accurate, for some were quoted from old literature and documents with unknown origin. The review will start off from records of the outbreak of infectious disease in the Joseon Dynasty and cover vaccination-related works in Korea in modern history and review the objectives and directions of current vaccination policies in South Korea.",

The first vaccination was inoculation with human smallpox, a practice widely carried out in ancient India, Arabia, and China. This method of vaccination consisted of collecting pus from a patient suffering from mild form of smallpox virus infection and inoculating the sample to a healthy human, which later led to a minor infection [1,2].",

Jong-In Lee started to vaccinate people, especially those in the wealthy class, who lived in Pocheon city. The method for vaccination has met its new era by Suk-Young Jee (1855-1935), known as a Korean Jenner since the opening of the port in 1876. In 1876, he learned to methods of vaccination from Japanese, wrote a book called Woodooshinsul to propagate the needs for the vaccination. As the effect of the vaccination has started to be seen, in September 1882, the first cowpox vaccination clinic was built in castle of Jeonju, followed by the second cowpox vaccination clinic built in Gongju in 1883. The vaccination recommendation was proposed in 1895. According to the recommendation, \"All children are required to be vaccinated between 70 days and a year after the birth.\" In 1899, the Jonggyso, the cowpox vaccination office, has been built to produce vaccines and to carry out vaccination. In 1900, the Hansung (old name of Seoul) Vaccination Recommendation was been established and distributed. The small pox vaccination efforts had historical significance because ability to control the infectious disease was achieved and the vaccination saved many lives by preventing smallpox during this period [6,7].",
