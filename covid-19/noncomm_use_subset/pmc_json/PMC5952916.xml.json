Duration of viral shedding was defined as the time from the first positive to the first negative virological result. Clearance was documented with 1 negative virological result using pathogen-specific NAT. Multiple episodes in 1 patient were only considered for inclusion if they occurred at least 1 week apart and were caused by different viruses or by the same virus with documentation of clinical response; clearance between both episodes indicated by a negative NAT result. Severe immunodeficiency was defined by one of the following: allogeneic HCT \u22646 months ago, acute graft-versus-host diseases (GvHD) grade \u22652 or bronchiolitis obliterans, leucopenia \u22641.0 \u00d7 109/liter or neutropenia <0.5 \u00d7 109/liter, lymphopenia \u22640.1 \u00d7 109/liter or hypogammaglobulinemia <4.5 g/L, or T-cell or B-cell depletion \u22643 months ago [10, 34]. VerySID was defined as having 2 or more of the SID criteria. In contrast, moderate immunodeficiency (MID) was defined as HCT >6 months ago, GvHD grade <2, absolute leucocyte count >1.0 \u00d7 109/liter, absolute lymphocyte count >0.1 \u00d7 109/liter, or absence of immunosuppressive drug treatment. Mortality attributable to viral infection was defined as death due to respiratory failure with no other cause identified except lower RTID [10].",

It is notable that lower RTID accounted for 36% of episodes, and most of these patients required admission. Thus, paramyxovirus RTID after allogeneic HCT continues to pose a significant clinical burden. Overall mortality was low, and indeed lower than compared with previous reports, and typically occurred in verySID patients having 2 and more SID criteria. Thus, patient susceptibility appears to be a key determinant of outcome even 1 year after allogeneic HCT, pointing to an immunologically still vulnerable time period.",

However, they may reflect differences in the study design of earlier studies that were limited to 100 days posttransplant as well as to changes in management of community-acquired respiratory virus infections such as deferral of HCT, consistent use of multiplex NAT for all symptomatic patients including outpatients, close follow-up, and the overall longer survival after HCT. A recent study also demonstrated that RTIDs continue to occur at high frequency in the late post-HCT phase after a median of 4 months [39]. Given that our patients were, for the most part, in hematological remission, return to a normal, less protected life with social contacts appears to be a plausible explaination for exposure to respiratory viruses within the first year after allogeneic HCT. Thus, awareness of the extended time of vulnerability emerging from this study as well as others may be an important observation for future antiviral and vaccine developments. This is also reflected in the recently completed trial of the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir, in which patients presented with upper or lower RTID at 278 days (9.3 months) and 451 days (15 months) posttransplantation [40].",

In a recent study, Kim et al [19] identified that an absolute lymphocyte count >1.0 \u00d7 109/liter at the time of upper RTID onset is protective regarding progression to lower RTID. This is in agreement with our data illustrating that only 1 of 54 patients with upper RTID and absolute lymphocyte count >1.0 \u00d7 109/liter progressed to lower RTID. In contrast, a threshold of <0.1 \u00d7 109/liter has been reported as a risk factor for progression [28, 41] and was adopted by our and earlier studies [10, 34], whereas others proposed the closely related cutoff of 0.2 \u00d7 109/liter [14].

By contrast, the impact of systemic RBV for MPV- and PIV-RTIDs is undefined. In our study, treatment was more often provided in the setting of MPV infections than PIV infections.

Until better, more specific, and more potent antiviral therapies become available, we conclude from our study that SID patients, particularly verySID patients fulfilling 2 or more SID criteria, can be treated safely with systemic RBV+IVIG, whereas IVIG alone can be offered to such patients with PIV-RTID. Shah et al [43] recently identified risk factors for poor outcome of RSV-RTIDs after allogeneic HCT and proposed a scoring index from 1 to 10 to classify patients with low (score 0\u20132), moderate (score 3\u20136), and high risk (7\u201310) for progression to identify those who would benefit most from (inhaled RBV-based) antiviral therapy. Their proposed criteria are similar to ours but also introduced age \u226540 years, myeloablative conditioning regimen, and use of corticosteroids within the prior 30 days [43]. In our center, previously reported criteria have been reported some time ago and were available for use since then. As can be seen from the direct comparison, there is a substantial overlap (Supplementary Table 4). Unfortunately, the score by Shah et al [43] is awaiting independent validation. Until further validation in a prospective setting is done, we will apply our simpler criteria of SID for respiratory virus RTID with essentially similar conclusions. Taken together, the data support the view that host immunodeficiency remains a major determinant of outcome, not only for RSV but also for MPV and PIV. Thus, there is a need to further validate such risk strata in prospective trials to balance treatment versus overtreatment and adverse events, particularly for MID HCT patients.",

Second, although we have standardized guidelines on therapeutic regimens for these infections in our hospital, its use was based on the discretion of the treating physician. Thus, more severe presentation may have been favored for treatment. Third, our study lacks a randomized control group to evaluate our treatment approach. The prospects of conducting such a trial for RBV have to await the results on currently ongoing trials testing more specifically designed new antivirals for RSV and hopefully other paramyxoviruses [44].

            "text": "In conclusion, we report that paramyxovirus RTID are frequent >100 days after allogeneic HCT and clinically more severe in SID patients despite preferential antiviral treatment. Although no definite conclusions about efficacy can be made, current mortality was reduced compared with our earlier studies. The data suggest that timely diagnosis and early treatment with effective pan-paramyxovirus antivirals will have a major impact on morbidity and mortality of SID HCT patients. Well designed randomized studies are needed to further validate risk strata to balance treatment versus overtreatment and adverse events.",
