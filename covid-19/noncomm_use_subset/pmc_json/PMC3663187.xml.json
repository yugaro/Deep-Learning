The most recent update by the WHO identified a total of 17 confirmed cases of human infection, including 11 deaths, suggesting a mortality rate of ~65% (5). All of these individuals had a history of recent travel to the Middle East. Identification of clusters of coronavirus cases indicates that HCoV-EMC can be transmitted from human to human (6) and raises concern about a possible outbreak of this virus, similar to the one caused by a related virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2002\u20132003. SARS-CoV, originating in China, spread throughout Asia and to other continents and affected more than 8,000 people (7, 8). The overall mortality during the outbreak was estimated at 9.6% (7). While the mortality rate of HCoV-EMC cannot be assessed with certainly, it could be more pathogenic than SARS-CoV.",

However, HCoV-EMC is more closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 (lineage 2C) than it is to SARS-CoV (lineage 2B) (2, 9). Less than 50% amino acid sequence identity is conserved in the replicase domains between SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC. Another important difference between the two viruses is that they do not use the same host cell receptor for infection (10). Indeed, it was clearly shown that human angiotensin-converting receptor 2 (hACE2), used by SARS-CoV, is not the HCoV-EMC receptor (10). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was recently identified as the HCoV-EMC receptor (11). This receptor is conserved among different species such as bats and humans, partially explaining the large host range of HCoV-EMC. This was somewhat surprising, as coronaviruses generally show strict host specificity.",

Viruses rely on host factors to replicate and often hijack cellular processes initiated in response to infection to ensure efficient replication (13). Targeting cellular responses has been shown to inhibit viral replication (13, 14). Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs that reduce the excessive host inflammatory response to respiratory viruses, as seen with influenza virus infections, have therapeutic benefit (reviewed in reference 15). Several genome-based drug repurposing strategies successfully identified known drugs that could be reused to treat lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (16), and influenza virus infection (14). Such an approach has the advantage of accelerating treatment availability, which could be crucial in case of an outbreak of an emerging pathogen.",

This fact could impact treatment strategies. To begin to assess this question, we compared the host response of human cells to HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV infection using global transcriptomic profiling. Our goal was to gain a rapid and comprehensive assessment of the host response to HCoV-EMC infection that could guide research on this emerging virus. Importantly, we used this information to computationally predict antiviral treatment and identified a broad down-regulation of the antigen presentation pathway that may be important in vivo for the development of an adaptive immune response.",

Calu-3 cells, derived from epithelial cells lining the human conducting airway, can be differentiated into polarized ciliated cells and permit robust replication of several respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV, influenza A virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (17\u201320). Therefore, Calu-3 cells were infected with HCoV-EMC using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and results were compared with those for Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV Urbani at the same MOI. The viruses replicated to similar levels, with both peaking at >107 PFU at 24 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1). While SARS-CoV has been previously shown to maintain steady replication and cell viability to 72 hpi (19), HCoV-EMC induced substantial cytopathic effect at 18 to 24 hpi, with significant cell rounding and detaching. Together, these data suggest that although HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV exhibit similar replication kinetics, they elicit different host responses in lung epithelial cells.",

The intersection between up- or down-regulated DE genes for each condition was calculated separately and then averaged to determine the percentage of intersecting genes (Fig. 2B). The overlap between signatures at late times postinfection for a single virus was very high; for example, 89% of the genes DE by HCoV-EMC at 18 hpi were also DE at 24 hpi, and on average 77% of the DE genes at 24 hpi with SARS-CoV were also DE at later times postinfection. However, the overlap between SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC at the same time point was low; for example, only 3% of the DE genes in response to HCoV-EMC at 24 hpi were also DE by SARS-CoV at this time point. Of note, the intersection of DE genes between the two infections was higher when later times postinfection for SARS-CoV were compared with earlier time points for HCoV-EMC. On average 22% of the HCoV-EMC signatures from 12 to 24 hpi overlapped the signatures of SARS-CoV from 36 to 72 hpi. Together, these results indicate that HCoV-EMC induced both a more robust and a largely different host response compared to that induced by SARS-CoV at similar times postinfection. However, changes induced from 12 to 24 hpi after HCoV-EMC were more similar to changes induced late after SARS-CoV infection (24 to 72 hpi).",

Several genes from the MHC I pathway, including proteasome genes (PSMB8 and PSMB9), genes from the peptide-loading complex (PDIA3 and TAPBP), and B2M, were down-regulated, as well as the gene for the invariant chain (CD74), which belongs to the MHC II pathway. Down-regulation of genes within MHC I and II pathways was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), with all 9 genes tested having significantly decreased expression in HCoV-EMC samples (Fig. 4C).

Upstream regulators are defined as any molecule that can affect the expression of another molecule, including transcription factors, cytokines, micro-RNAs and drugs. The activation state for each regulator was predicted based on global direction of changes throughout infection for previously published targets of this regulator. The predicted top five activated and top five down-regulated regulators are shown in Fig. 5B. The top five activated upstream regulators included genes and molecules that are known to induce the activation of inflammatory genes that were also found up-regulated in the early signature. The top predicted inhibited regulators included four kinase inhibitors (SB203580, LY294002, U0126, and SP600125) and one corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide). These molecules are known to down-regulate the same genes that were up-regulated early and across HCoV-EMC infection. In addition, several kinase inhibitors (including SB203580, LY294002, and U0126) and a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) were also predicted to be negative regulators of genes changed similarly after SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC infection at late times postinfection (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).

This data-driven tool allows the identification of molecules that induce similar or opposite transcriptional changes relative to the query signature, based on their connectivity scores. The connectivity score is a value between +1 and \u22121, where a high positive score indicates that the drug induces changes similar to those induced by viral infection, while a high negative score indicates that the drug reverses the expression of the HCoV-EMC signature.

Treating cells with 5 \u00b5M SB203580 following SARS-CoV infection resulted in a significant decrease of 20% in the log10 viral titer at 24 hpi (P < 0.01); these replication levels are similar to those in interferon (IFN)-treated cells. SB203580 was less effective against EMC-CoV, showing no efficacy with posttreatment; however, pretreatment of infection resulted in significant decreases of 15% and 7% of the log10 viral titer, at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively (P < 0.01). Efficacy against SARS-CoV can be explained by the fact that all genes that were DE after SARS-CoV infection were predicted to be regulated by kinase inhibitors (cluster I and II genes [Fig. 3] and additional genes specific to SARS-CoV [data not shown]), while the 8,918 genes specific to HCoV-EMC (clusters III and IV [Fig. 3]) did not include any kinase inhibitor in their upstream negative regulators (see Table S2). In addition, host response dynamics to SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC were different, with a delayed and more limited response to SARS-CoV allowing SB203580 posttreatment to be effective. In contrast, EMC-CoV rapidly induced host expression changes and thus required SB203580 pretreatment for measurable effect. As genes specific to HCoV-EMC were predicted to be negatively regulated by other classes of molecules (like gemfibrozil, which targets PPAR\u03b1; z = 2.96), it will be important to determine whether using such molecules in combination with kinase inhibitors like SB203580 could provide a better inhibition of viral replication. Together, these data demonstrate the efficacy of SB203580 against two unique CoVs and validate in silico approaches to predict effective drug treatment for emergent viruses.",

Kindler et al. performed RNA-Seq on human airway epithelium (HAE) cells infected with HCoV-EMC (24). However, their analysis was focused on viral sequences and did not include a genome-wide analysis of the host response. They did, however, use RT-qPCR (quantitative PCR) to compare expression levels of a set of 15 genes, including IFN, RNA sensor molecules, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), following infection with HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, or HCoV-229E (MOI 0.1). In our study, we confirm that SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC induce a similar up-regulation of RNA sensor molecules, such as RIGI, MDA5, and two of three genes of ISGF3 (IRF9 and STAT1) (genes in cluster I [Fig. 3]). Of note, HCoV-EMC titers were up to 102-fold higher than those of SARS-CoV in HAE cells (24), whereas we observed similar viral replication of the two CoVs in Calu-3 cells. Lower replication of SARS-CoV in HAE cells might be explained by the mixed cell population in these primary cultures, with likely nonuniform expression of SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2). In contrast, Calu-3 2B4 cells used in our study are a clonal population of Calu-3 cells sorted for ACE2 expression which support high replication of SARS-CoV. In addition, while Kindler et al. noted the absence of induction of IFN-\u03b2 at 3, 6, and 12 hpi (24), we found a specific up-regulation of IFN-\u03b15 and IFN-\u03b21 by HCoV-EMC at 18 and 24 hpi (genes in cluster III) and an up-regulation of IFN-\u03b121 by both SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC at 24 hpi (cluster I) (expression values for all DE genes are available at http://www.systemsvirology.org). These data illustrate that HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV both trigger the activation of pattern recognition receptors but may subsequently induce different levels of IFN. Moreover, there were stark differences in global downstream ISG expression following infection with SARS-CoV or HCoV-EMC; this analysis is discussed in detail elsewhere (V. D. Menachery et al., submitted for publication).",

IL-17A was predicted to be activated throughout infection with HCoV-EMC and may induce immune-mediated pathology that possibly contributes to a high mortality rate. IL-17A is known to be produced by T-helper cells, but its expression in Calu3 cells was increased up to 2-fold at 24 hpi after HCoV-EMC infection. Interestingly, IL-17C and IL-17F, which can be produced by epithelial cells under certain inflammatory conditions and which activate pathways similar to IL-17A-mediated responses (27), were increased earlier and to a greater extent following HCoV-EMC infection (up to 3-fold at 18 hpi for IL-17C and 4-fold at 7 hpi for IL-17F). Therefore, further study of the IL-17 response may provide interesting targets to limit lung injury (26).",

            "text": "A main difference between responses to HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV was the specific down-regulation of the antigen presentation pathway after HCoV-EMC infection. In contrast, these genes were found to be up-regulated after SARS-CoV infection. Several viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit both the MHC class I (reviewed in references 28 and 29) and class II (reviewed in reference 30) pathways. While expression of MHC class II is usually limited to professional antigen-presenting cells, human lung epithelial cells constitutively express this complex (31). Our data demonstrated down-regulation of the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) after HCoV-EMC infection, a finding that possibly explains decreases in MHC class II molecule expression; this is a common viral strategy used to block that pathway (30). MHC class II inhibition can prevent class II-mediated presentation of endogenous viral antigens produced within infected cells and impair the adaptive immune response. Similarly, MHC class I genes were also down-regulated after HCoV-EMC infection; decreasing expression of MHC class I can attenuate CD8 T-cell-mediated recognition of infected cells and could allow immune evasion by HCoV-EMC. Finally, PSMB8 and PSMB9, parts of the immunoproteasome, were also down-regulated by HCoV-EMC; these components replace portions of the standard proteasome and enhance production of MHC class I binding peptides (32). In their absence, proteins targeted for degradation may not generate peptides that robustly bind MHC class I, thus limiting their presentation. Down-regulation of PSMB8 and PSMB9 could counteract the host response to viral infection, including up-regulation of ubiquitins and ubiquitin ligases observed during HCoV-EMC infection (Fig. 3B) that may ineffectively target viral protein for degradation. Together, the inhibition of MHC class I and II as well as immunoproteasome construction may have an important impact on the in vivo adaptive immune response against HCoV-EMC.",

Targeting host factors important for the virus, instead of the virus itself, has been investigated for HIV (34) and influenza virus (13). For example, inhibiting upstream regulators (such as NF-\u03baB) that control the host response to influenza virus infection has been shown to reduce virus replication in vitro and in mice (35). Inhibition of immunophilins that interact with the viral nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) resulted in potent inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (36, 37).

            "text": "The top five inhibited regulators included one glucocorticoid and four kinase inhibitors; these drugs may be able to directly block part of the host response and impact viral replication/pathogenesis. Among them, LY294002, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), has known antiviral activity, inhibiting the replication of influenza virus (38), vaccinia virus (39), and HCMV (40). SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, is also an effective antiviral against the encephalomyocarditis virus (41), RSV (42), and HIV (43). LY294002 and SB203580 were also identified in Connectivity Map, a database of drug-associated gene expression profiles (22), as molecules reversing components of the HCoV-EMC gene expression signature. Finally, SB203580 showed promising antiviral results against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV in our in vitro assay (Fig. 4C). Further extensive studies, including dose-response tests and tests of other kinases inhibitors, are ongoing. Nonetheless, these results validate our genome-based drug prediction, which allows rapid identification of effective antivirals. Despite central roles of PI3K and MAPK pathways in regulating multiple cellular processes, many kinase inhibitors targeting these pathways have been shown to be safe and well tolerated in vivo (reviewed in references 44 and 45). It has been hypothesized that mitogenic MAPK and survival PI3K/Akt pathways may be of major importance only during early development of an organism and may be dispensable in adult tissues (13). Several drugs targeting JNK, PI3K, and MEK have shown promising therapeutic potential in humans against a variety of diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorder (44, 45). p38 MAPK inhibitors have also been evaluated in humans, but the first generation of molecules, including SB203580, has a high in vivo toxicity (liver and/or central nervous system). However, development of novel nontoxic inhibitors (e.g., ML3403) (46), more selective molecules (e.g., AS1940477) (47), and administration via inhalation (48) are promising strategies for use of this class of inhibitor for treatment of pulmonary disease. Overall, these results indicate that kinase inhibitors could be used as broad anti-CoV agents which might be combined with other host-targeting molecules, like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) agonists, to better inhibit HCoV-EMC replication.",

Criteria for differential expression were an absolute log2 FC of 1 and a q value of <0.01 calculated using a moderated t test with subsequent Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Differentially expressed (DE) genes after HCoV-EMC infection at early times postinfection were defined as all genes DE at 0, 3, 7, or 12 hpi, and genes DE at late times postinfection were defined as all genes DE at 18 or 24 hpi. To identify genes with similar patterns of variation at early and late times postinfection, early and late signatures were intersected considering up-regulated and down-regulated genes separately and then combined to define the signature of 207 stable genes. To cluster the genes DE at late times postinfection following HCoV-EMC infection, differential expression was also calculated directly between SARS-CoV- and HCoV-EMC-infected samples using the same criteria. A comparison of similar times postinfection was performed, except for HCoV-EMC-infected samples at 18 hpi, which were compared to SARS-CoV samples at 24 hpi. HCoV-EMC samples at 24 hpi were compared with SARS samples at 24 hpi and later times postinfection (30, 36, 48, 54, 60, and 72 hpi). Genes similarly changed between HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV (cluster I and II) were defined as genes DE by both viruses compared to their time-matched mocks and that were also not differentially changed between HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV in at least one of the previously listed comparisons. Genes of cluster III and IV were genes DE at late times postinfection following HCoV-EMC infection that were not similarly changed between HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV. To further cluster the genes based on their expression value after HCoV-EMC infection, log2 FC values at 18 and 24 hpi were averaged, and clusters I and III were genes with average log2 FC values of >0, while cluster II and IV genes had average log2 FC values of <0.",
