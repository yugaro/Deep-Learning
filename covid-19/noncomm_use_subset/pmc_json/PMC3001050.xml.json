            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding event that increases the versatility of gene expression. It is mainly utilized by eukaryotic RNA viruses (1\u20133), though some prokaryotic (4) and mammalian genes (5\u20137) are also controlled by ribosomal frameshifting. The requirements for \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting are the presence of a slippery heptanucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ (where X can be A, U, G or C; Y can be A or U; and Z does not equal Y; the spaces indicate the original reading frame) (8) followed by a downstream structural element, such as a pseudoknot, a hairpin or an antisense oligonucleotide duplex [for reviews, see (9)]. Although the mechanism of frameshifting is still elusive, a promising model has been proposed by Brierley and co-workers using cryo-electron microscopy to image mammalian 80S ribosomes (10). In their model, the ribosome is paused by its inability to unwind a pseudoknot structure resulting in a blockage of the A-site by eEF-2. During translocation, the P-site tRNA is bent in the 3\u2032-direction by opposing forces. To release the tension, the P-site tRNA may un-pair and subsequently re-pair in the \u22121 frame with a certain frequency, followed by A-site tRNA delivery into the new \u22121 reading frame. These and other recent data obtained by mechanical unfolding of frameshifter pseudoknots suggest that mRNA secondary structures with certain conformational features that resist ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF-2 catalyzed translocation are key players in ribosomal frameshifting.",

Various kinds of modifications in backbones, sugars or even analogs have already been studied extensively [for reviews, see (22,23)] to meet these requirements. Locked nucleic acid (LNA) is a rather novel nucleic acid analog comprising a class of bicyclic high-affinity RNA analogs in which the furanose ring of LNA monomers is conformationally locked in an RNA-mimicking C3\u2032-endo/N-type conformation (24). The LNA modification also resists degradation by cellular nucleases. Furthermore, introducing LNA into DNA or RNA oligonucleotides improves the affinity for complementary sequences and increases the melting temperature by several degrees (25). A recent study showed that LNA/DNA mix-mers against miRNA-122 can be acutely administered at high dosage with long lasting effects without any evidence of LNA-associated toxicities or histopathological changes in the studied animals (26). These data suggests that LNA is a promising candidate for small oligonucleotide applications.",

LNA/DNA mix-mers were designed in which nucleotides starting from the 3\u2032-end were gradually replaced by LNA (Figure 4). Increasing the number of LNAs from one to two and four in these DNA oligonucleotides improved their frameshift inducing ability, reaching an apparent optimum of 7.0% with four LNA substitutions. Further increase of the LNA content to 6 nt (LD6) did not improve frameshift efficiency, but, on the other hand, LD6 also did not lead to the dramatic decrease as observed above for the LNA6 oligonucleotide applied in the SF468 construct. We suspected that (partial) self-complementarity may be limiting the effective concentration of free LNA/DNA oligonucleotides. To check this possibility, we ran all the oligonucleotides on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Figure 5 showes that the LNA6 oligonucleotide indeed migrated more slowly indicative of partial dimer formation, presumably by intermolecular base pairing of the palindromic GCGCGC sequences in each oligonucleotide (compare the migration to that of the full dimer formed by annealing of oligonucleotides DNA18 and 18DNA). The LD series, as predicted, migrated as monomers. We noted that LD2, though loaded in equal amount, based on its UV absorbance, showed a higher affinity to ethidium bromide than its counterparts. At present we have no explanation for this unexpected behavior of LD2, since its migration and therefore its conformation was identical to the other LNA/DNA mix-mers.\n\n",

To investigate this possibility we carried out UV-melting studies of the 18-nt LNA oligonucleotides in a 1:1 complex with an 18-nt RNA (18RNA) representing the mRNA. The melting temperatures (Tm) are shown in Table 1. The Tm of the 18RNA/RNA18 duplex was the highest with 82\u00b0C in agreement with its high frameshifting efficiency. The 18RNA/DNA18 duplex had a much lower Tm of 72\u00b0C, which is expected for an RNA/DNA hybrid, and also agreed with the lower frameshifting efficiency. The LNA substituted oligonucleotides, all had higher Tms (+4 to +9\u00b0C) than DNA18. The Tm of L2-2 was with 81\u00b0C almost as high as that of RNA18. Remarkably there was no correlation between the Tm of the LNA oligonucleotides and their frameshifting inducing capacity. For example, the Tm of LNA2 was rather low with 76\u00b0C but it had the highest frameshifting activity, and L2-2, which had the highest Tm, actually had the lowest frameshifting activity. Tms of L2-3 and L2-4 were identical but their frameshifting activities were 2.3 and 4.6%, respectively. We also noted that both L2-2 and L2-3 were comparable to DNA18 in frameshifting activity but formed far more stable duplexes. These data suggest that the position effect of the LNA substitutions is related to the mechanism of frameshifting and not per se to their thermodynamic stability.\n",

The optimal length of small antisense oligonucleotides, however, was not investigated. Understanding the optimal length of trans-acting oligonucleotides that can induce the most efficient frameshifting and, at the same time, escape RNAi interference will be an important issue for future in vivo applications. Here we found that maximum levels of frameshifting were obtained with oligonucleotides of 12 nt and more. This is comparable to the stem lengths (S1+S2) of known examples of highly frameshift inducing H-type pseudoknots, such as the 6+6 bp of the Simian retrovirus type\u22121 pseudoknot (29), the 11+6 bp of the minimal Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) pseudoknot (30), and the 6+6 bp chimeric Mouse Mammary Tumor virus (MMTV)-IBV pseudoknot (31). In addition, in known examples of hairpin-induced frameshifts, the stem length of hairpins is around 12 bp (32\u201334). This may imply that a full helical turn of an RNA helix either in one single stem or in two stacking stems of a pseudoknot (S1+S2) is selected by viruses to induce efficient ribosomal frameshifting.",

Replacing 2 nt in a DNA oligonucleotide by LNA was already sufficient to reach the same level of frameshifting as with a comparable RNA oligonucleotide. However, the excellent affinity of LNA oligonucleotides could be a double-edged sword in certain cases. In our experimental system, the oligonucleotides are partly self-complementary and this resulted in the formation of dimers (Figure 5), which were apparently unable to induce frameshifting (LNA6, Figure 3). Hence, LNA substitutions should be optimized in a sequence that is prone to form dimers. In our SF462 construct (Figure 4), the optimal number of LNA substitutions to induce the most significant amount of frameshifting is four. LD6 with two additional LNA substitutions did not improve the efficiency. Thus, our results suggest that the first 4 bp are critical for antisense-induced frameshifting. A likely explanation is that when a ribosome that is translating the slippery sequence, the helicase active site is around position +11, with respect to the first nucleotide of the P-site, which is close to the first base pair of the mRNA/oligonucleotide duplex (35). Increasing the local thermodynamic stability in this region may prevent ribosomes to unwind RNA structures, causing ribosomal pausing at the slippery sequence, and finally results in a higher frequency of ribosomal frameshifting.",

Although one could expect that spacing of two LNA groups by two non-modified sugars as applied in probes for miRNAs, results in the optimal induction of the 3\u2032-endo conformation in the neighboring sugars (36), this was not the case in our frameshift assays. Here such a spacing was less efficient (see data for L2-4, Figure 6).

Since we showed here that antisense oligonucleotides can induce frameshifting presumably by serving as a physical barrier for the elongating ribosome, it will be interesting to measure the strength of these linear oligonucleotides in complex with (a piece of) mRNA by optical tweezers and see if there is a correlation with their frameshifting efficiency.",
