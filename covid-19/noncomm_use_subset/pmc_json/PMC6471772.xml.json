            "text": "The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is crucial for normal mandibular movement, which is associated with numerous vital physiological processes, including chewing, talking and functions that require the opening of the mouth (1). TMJ ankylosis (TMJA) restricts the movement of the mandible, which results in severe health problems in patients (2). TMJA can result from various factors including trauma, infection, congenital issues and arthritis, among these, trauma in the TMJ region is the most common cause, such as a condylar fracture (3). There are several hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of traumatic TMJA. For example, it has been suggested that the abnormal healing of the fractured condyle is the principal reason for TMJA in the bone (4). Specifically, injury in the TMJ region may result in haematoma, fibrosis and the abnormal formation of excessive bone (5). A previous study hypothesized that the intra-articular bone fragment may help to increase the extent of ankylosis (6). Based on the anatomy of the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM), it can be inferred that the contraction of the LPM will generate sufficient distraction force to the condyle neck during the opening of the mouth and confirm the \u2018distraction osteogenesis (DO) effect of LPM\u2019 hypothesis, which is that the LPM may exert a DO effect during the healing of the fractured condyle (7). In addition, the LPM exerts an important function in the reconstruction of the sagittal fractured condyle (8) and a previous study has reported that TMJA will be significantly alleviated if the LPM is dissected (9). Furthermore, the study of Dai et al (10) also suggested that local injection of botulinum toxin A would temporarily block impulses from the LPM's and may effectively prevent the occurrence of traumatic TMJA. Consequently, blocking the LPM may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention of traumatic TMJA. Unfortunately, the associated molecular mechanisms of traumatic TMJA and the effects of LPM have yet to be completely elucidated, which has limited the development of suitable therapeutic strategies.",

A total of 6 male sheep (aged 6 months, 25\u201335 kg) were kept under 20\u00b0C, 40\u201360% humidity with a circadian rhythm (12:12 h light:dark cycle). The animals were fed with a standard diet and had free access to water. The traumatic TMJA model was constructed according to the protocol outlined in previous publications (9,11,12). Briefly, the bilateral TMJ capsule was exposed from an incision to the anterior tragus. The joint capsule was incised and the condyle was exposed, and underwent a sagittal fracture by piezosurgery. Meanwhile, the outside quarter of the joint disc was dissected and a \u2018#\u2019 shaped groove was created by piezosurgery on the fossa surface. In addition, the right side LPM was dissected (LPD) while the left side was normal (LPN) i.e. without dissection. The tissue was tightly sutured apart from the capsule and penicillin (1 mg pure penicillin G sodium per sheep for 3 days) was used to prevent infection. Sheep who did not receive surgery i.e. untreated normal sheep (UTR) were used as a blank control. The surgical procedures are illustrated in Fig. S1. A total of 6 sheep were used and randomly divided into 2 groups of 3, which comprised the 4- and 12 weeks evaluation groups. In each group, one sheep was randomly selected as the UTR and the remaining sheep were subjected to surgery. For each animal in the group of surgical sheep, the right side of the TMJ was the LPD group while the left side was the LPN group.",

Generally, in the present study, the LPN group exhibited a higher expression of active genes in the early stage, whereas more genes were activated in the LPD group at the later stage. Although the exact number of altered genes cannot be ascertained from the scatter plot, it corroborated the authors' hypothesis that genes associated with osteogenesis are dominant. During the process of DO, rapid osteogenesis is occurring in the first month, which may limit the degree to which the mouth can open and decrease the force of LPM (15). As a result, the DO effect of LPM is weakened and returns to a stable state. Therefore, most genes are upregulated at an early stage and are then subsequently downregulated. Conversely, the dissection of LPM makes it similar to the normal bone fracture healing process and the majority of the osteogenesis associated genes are activated in a relatively late stage. However, the exact differential genes involved in this process require further analysis.",

It is not uncommon that differences between Affymetrix GeneChip data and RT-qPCR measurements are detected. This may be due to the non-specific hybridization of genes and the fact that these processes rely on different algorithms (26). Nevertheless, the gene chip data is considered accurate (27) and a previously study has also suggested that the gene chip data should be coupled with RT-qPCR analysis (28).",
