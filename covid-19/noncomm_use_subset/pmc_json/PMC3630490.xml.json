An elaborate framework featuring the subsequent stages in the emergence process of a species jump has already been developed, describing how an established animal pathogen, through stages of spill-over and lengthening of the transmission chain in the novel host, may evolve all the way up to an established and genetically consolidated pathogenic agent.8,9,10 However, as implied by the above broader definition of EID, other categories can be distinguished in addition to emergence in a novel host, including disease outbreaks in an existing host or the emergence of a disease complex beyond the normal geographic range.",

            "text": "Here, we will argue that changes in host range, in pathogen traits displayed in the same host, and the geographic distribution of a disease complex, form three distinct sets of complementary and only slightly intersecting disease emergence scenarios. Together, these scenarios present the full picture and range of possible disease emergence dynamics. Hence, we categorize EIDs into three main groups, with emergence of (i) a pathogen in a novel host; (ii) a pathogen with novel traits within the same host; and (iii) a disease complex moving into a novel geographic area. Human actions that modulate the interplay between pathogens, hosts and environment are at the basis of almost all EID events, although the exact drivers and mechanisms differ. For each of the three groups, we will argue how the emergence process is driven by specific sets of causal factors, discuss the changes in disease ecology and transmission and elaborate on the invasion dynamics and on the characteristics of pathogens that are dominant in each group. Such structuring of the myriad of EID on the basis of the changes in the interplay between pathogens, hosts and environment will assist in better understanding of specific EID events and in designing tailored measures for prevention and prediction. Moreover, the framework contributes to understanding the effects of human actions that pave the way for the three distinct emergence scenarios. We propose that the resulting framework applies not just to pathogens affecting humans and animals in agriculture and natural ecosystems; it may be usefully applied also for pest and disease emergence in aquaculture, plant production and insect rearing.",

Subsequent authors adapted and/or expanded these lists of drivers and even proposed ranking of drivers according to incidence.2,4,11,13 Drivers shaping emergence in domestic animals and wildlife are analogous to the drivers for EIDs in humans.14 Notably, changes of anthropogenic nature are at the basis of virtually all EIDs in humans, domestic animals and wildlife.14,15,16,17,18,19 Human population growth and economic development have translated in a growing need for land, water and energy, and thus created a global set of more proximate drivers of disease emergence including deforestation and associated biodiversity loss, climate change, imbalances in agricultural and food supply systems, increases in travel, trade and traffic and a persistence of poor health systems and protection practices.",

As shown in Figure 1, disease emergence starts with an existing disease complex or pathogen\u2013host\u2013environment complex. While the three emergence categories are broadly speaking distinct, there are also grey areas, between existing and emerging disease events and at the interfaces of the three disease emergence categories. Taken together, these different sets of circumstances represent the full range of disease emergence. A brief introduction to the basics of this framework and the three distinct emergence categories is given in the present section.

A key factor in the first scenario, geographic expansion, is the suitability of the landscape for the disease complex to become introduced and established.

Microbial reservoirs with potentially hazardous disease agents circulate in non-human primates, wild carnivores, birds, bats and rodents. Humans may become infected encroaching forest and game reserves, including hunting for and consumption of wild meat.45 Interspecies contact rates have gone up considerably also as a result of the steep recent and ongoing growth in human population and increases in food animal production. Wildlife migration can facilitate species jumps to domestic animals and humans.46 The pressures on the natural resource base forces wildlife into farming and urban landscapes, enhancing species mixing. One example is the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in pigs and subsequently humans, and triggered by fruit bats foraging fruit trees near pig farms, using also pig manure as fertilizer.47",

In these settings, there is a premium going to pathogens circumventing bio-exclusion and other health protection regimens. Also, mass rearing of food animals entails large numbers of genetically-similar animals of the same age (young) and sex, kept in high densities. Rapid population turnover and live animal transport support onward transmission once a pathogen with novel traits has emerged. For example, flocks of free-grazing ducks rotating in rice paddy fields and ending up in live bird markets played an important role in the transmission of H5N1 HPAI.49,74,75 Pathogens with novel traits may find ready access to human hosts via the food chain, through the handling of live animals, via aerosols emitted by animals in the intensive production units, in wet markets, through ingestion of manure contaminated food commodities, or related to waste disposal.59 One example forms a novel methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain that emerged in humans in the Netherlands in 2003 and could be traced back to an origin in pig farming.76",

In addition, when the numbers of infected individuals are still low, extinction may easily occur by chance, even if the R0 of the pathogen in the new landscape is greater than 1.

Geographic jumps may also result from the active migration of wild species including a range of mammals and also birds, fish and arthropods, in the process introducing entire microbial reservoirs into novel geographic areas.46",

EID events are grouped into three main, distinct and only slightly intersecting categories that each features typical disease ecological dynamics, sets of drivers of emergence and pathogen trait profiles. The framework is not restricted to infectious disease emergence in human and livestock as it would also apply to pest and disease challenges emerging in plant production, fisheries and bee keeping. The framework thus has potential to assist in disentangling and structuring a formidable amount of information on infectious diseases and may be used to help identify the circumstances in food and agriculture, natural resource management and other forms of human behavior that enhance pathogen emergence. This, in turn, may lead to adjustments in food and agriculture, land use, physical planning, trade practices and so on, based on more thorough understanding of the interplay and feedback between human action, pathogen\u2013host\u2013environment dynamics, and pathogen evolution.",

Flare-ups of existing diseases may interfere with, overlap with or assist new disease emergence given the fluctuations in disease prevalence and incidence. Figure 1 also elaborates on the grey areas between the three emergence categories. The disease emergence narratives presented here are mostly of recent origin, stretching over just a few decades, and matching the turbulence created by a global set of contemporary drivers bringing the rapid changes in the availability, use and management of the earth's terres-trial resources. Naturally, in such a time frame, disease emergence and pathogen evolution are based on variations of already existing forms of microbial life. A different temporal resolution would have changed the picture. All currently existing pathogens at some stage in their evolutionary history have switched host species, spread geographically and underwent character changes. Hence, when fitting EID events in the current framework, the geospatial and temporal scales of the event should be made explicit and accounted for. Using the framework here presented, most EID pathogens and disease emergence dynamics are captured with relative ease. In some cases, precise information on changes in pathogen genetics, host specificity, transmission modes, incidence and pattern or invasion dynamics relative to the pre-emergence situation is missing. Here, the framework may assist in gap analysis to reveal critical information that is missing and/or research yet to be performed.",

In fact, in these countries, the fight against old and new diseases would present a twin objective. In contrast, in the wealthier countries, many of the old diseases have been eliminated, are being effectively suppressed or never occurred. Naturally, this does not apply to EID events and pandemic threats remain a major global concern. Disrupting the transmission of EID events may turn notoriously difficult and a more preventative approach is therefore called for, with creation of robustness and resilience at the human/food and agriculture/ecosystems interfaces, collectively involving health professionals, in particularly at the community level, farmers, hunters, tourists, consumers and the public at large.103 It is in this sense that the here presented framework for emerging infectious disease analysis may be usefully applied.",
