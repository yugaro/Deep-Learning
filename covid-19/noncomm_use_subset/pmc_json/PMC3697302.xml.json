Maybe we have to take a closer look at the possibility of reassortment among any of the 16 hemagglutinins and 9 neuraminidases subtypes, and even within the newly identified bat-derived, influenza-like virus H17N10.3,4",

Scientists from both countries are now working on several earlier suspected cases. There is no evidence that the patients in the USA or Japan had travelled to China. Therefore, it seems the virus has been in the USA and Japan for some time.

The infected areas in China are concentrated in central China, covering six provinces. The major clinical symptoms and signs in the patients from the three countries are the same: high fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated levels of serum hepatic enzymes. Although this group of viruses is transmitted by ticks, there is evidence in China that person-to-person transmission was highly probable through direct blood contact when the index patients had high viremia.12,13,14 Therefore, SFTSV is indeed a dangerous pathogen, and precautionary measures should be implemented in epidemic areas. Although no virus has yet been isolated from ticks, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on tick samples revealed evidence of virus.",
