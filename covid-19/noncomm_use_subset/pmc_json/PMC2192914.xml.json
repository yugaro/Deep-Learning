The finding that SLC is not expressed in plt mice strongly supports the hypothesis that SLC is required for naive T cell homing. Like naive T cells, activated DCs migrate to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. Therefore, we examined the distribution of DCs in plt mice. By FACS\u00ae analysis, DC numbers were decreased 60% in the LNs of plt mice (Fig. 2 A). The average number of total I-A+ DCs in the pooled LNs of +/+ mice was 24.5 \u00b1 4.7 \u00d7 103 per mouse compared with 9.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 103 in plt mice (P < 0.01, n = 3). Immunohistochemistry established that this decrease was most pronounced in the deep cortex. Those DCs that were present in plt mice typically clustered in the internodular cortex (Fig. 3, A and B). In the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal (Fig. 2 B), but there was a striking abnormality in cell distribution (Fig. 3). Staining with anti-CD11c revealed a marked decrease in the number of DCs within the white pulp (Fig. 3, C and D). There was a concomitant increase in the number of DCs located outside the white pulp, either in bridging channels or in isolated clusters within the red pulp, such that the total number of splenic DCs remained normal. Staining with NLDC-145, which in the spleen is specific for interdigitating DCs (34), also revealed a decrease in the number of these cells within the white pulp and demonstrated that those DCs outside the white pulp were NLDC-145 negative (Fig. 3, E and F).

The identity of these cells as DCs was confirmed by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles, their staining with anti-CD11c (Fig. 4 B) and anti\u2013I-A (Fig. 4 C), and their low buoyant density.

Similar to our findings in abdominal epidermis, dorsal ear epidermis from plt mice contains a normal number of DCs (Fig. 6 E). When segments of dorsal ear skin were placed in culture, the number of DCs within the epidermis of +/+ and plt mice decreased to a similar extent over 72 h (Fig. 6, A, B, and E). Over the same time period, the number of DCs within the dermis increased similarly in plt and +/+ mice (not shown). As described previously (31), migrating DCs formed cords within the dermal lymphatics of +/+ mice (Fig. 6 C). A similar formation of cords was seen in plt mice (Fig. 6 D), demonstrating that the plt mutation does not inhibit the entry of DCs into lymphatics. When the cells migrating out of dorsal ear skin were collected over 72 h and counted, the number of DCs released from the skin of plt and +/+ mice was similar (Fig. 6 F). ",

To determine if the decreased accumulation of DCs in plt mice leads to a decrease in the production of ELC, we examined ELC expression in plt mice. By Northern analysis, ELC mRNA levels in the LNs and spleen of plt mice were reduced compared with +/+ mice (Fig. 7 E). By in situ hybridization, ELC expression was reduced in the LNs of plt mice compared with +/+ mice (Fig. 7, A and B). ELC antisense probes hybridized most strongly to the outer LN cortex in a region corresponding to the area in which DCs accumulated in plt mice (compare Fig. 7 B and Fig. 3 B). In the spleens of plt mice, ELC expression was also reduced (Fig. 7, C and D). As in LNs, the hybridization signal in plt spleen localized to regions that correspond to the area in which DCs accumulated (compare Fig. 7 D and Fig. 3 D).

Comparison of plt and +/+ sequence over a 3-kb region extending from 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site to 1 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal revealed several single base changes but no mutation that would account for a loss of SLC expression (data not shown).

Second, they can provide a chemotactic signal for lymphocyte migration through the endothelium and into the underlying tissue. We believe that SLC is the chemokine that mediates the first of these steps during the homing of naive T cells to LNs and PPs. Evidence in support of this conclusion includes the expression of SLC on HEVs, the ability of SLC to activate both \u03b1L\u03b22 and \u03b14\u03b27 integrins on T cells, the ability of SLC to stimulate the rapid arrest of rolling T cells with an efficiency similar to that seen in vivo, and the absence of any other known chemokine with similar characteristics. We now add to this body of evidence by demonstrating that mice homozygous for the plt mutation do not express SLC (Fig. 1). The lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice is similar to that seen when naive T cells are treated with pertussis toxin\u2014failure of naive T cells to enter LNs, PPs, or the white pulp of spleen, suggesting that the defect in plt mice occurs in the initial steps of lymphocyte extravasation (29, 42, 43). Like pertussis toxin treatment, the lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice probably represents a loss of the signal for the integrin-mediated firm adhesion of naive T cells.",

The lack of T cells in the white pulp of spleen in plt mice suggests that SLC is also required for the entry of naive T cells into the T cell zones of spleen. By analogy with the defect seen in LNs, it is plausible that SLC provides the stimulus for an integrin activation step that is required for movement of naive T cells into the white pulp of spleen. SLC may also provide a chemotactic stimulus that guides naive T cells into the T cell zones of LNs and spleen. However, this function is unlikely to be unique, as other lymphocyte-specific chemokines such as ELC and DCCK1 are expressed in T cell zones (41, 44). ELC has been shown to be more potent than SLC against naive T cells, and therefore may predominate in providing a chemotactic stimulus within the T cell zone (39).",

Similarly, the expression of SLC at sites such as lymphatic endothelium suggested to us that SLC may be involved in other leukocyte trafficking events and that plt mice may have other leukocyte trafficking defects. We now find that plt mice have a defect in the migration of DCs into the T cell zones of lymphoid organs. Four lines of evidence support this finding. First, the number of DCs in the T cell zones of LNs and spleen in plt mice is decreased (Fig. 3). In the spleen, this decrease occurs despite a normal total number of splenic DCs (Fig. 2). Second, DCs appear to accumulate at the periphery of T cell zones in both LNs and spleen of plt mice (Fig. 3). The pattern of this accumulation is consistent with a block in the entry of DCs into T cell zones. Third, we directly demonstrate a decrease in the migration of FITC-activated DCs to draining LNs of plt mice (Fig. 4). It is possible that this defect in DC migration is secondary to the paucity of T cells in the LNs of plt mice. However, in both L-selectin knockout mice, which have a defect in the homing of naive lymphocytes to LNs similar to that of plt mice, and nude mice, which lack mature T cells, FITC-stimulated migration of DCs to LNs is normal (12, 35, 45, 46). This suggests that DC migration to LNs is not lymphocyte dependent. Fourth, splenic DCs in the bridging channels and red pulp of plt mice fail to redistribute to the T cell zone upon activation with LPS (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that plt mice lack a factor that acts directly on DCs to stimulate their migration. Due to its lack of expression, the probable identity of this factor is SLC.",

DCs derived in culture from monocytes or CD34+ precursors do not express CCR7, the receptor for SLC and ELC. CCR7 expression is induced in these cells by activation with LPS, CD40 ligand, or TNF. Similarly, activated DCs increase intracellular calcium and undergo chemotaxis in response to ELC. These results suggest that immature DCs become responsive to SLC and ELC upon activation in vivo and that one or both of these chemokines is involved in the migration of activated DCs. It has been suggested that it is the activation-induced downregulation of chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR5, and CCR6 that allows DCs to leave sites of inflammation, whereas the more gradual induction of CCR7 on these cells allows them to enter T cell zones in response to ELC (47, 48). Our results support this hypothesis, though we would suggest that SLC, rather than ELC, may play the predominant role.",

In comparison, the LD50 of Sendai virus is reduced 10-fold in mice lacking cytotoxic T cell function and 300-fold in nude mice compared with +/+ controls (50). In our view, the most likely cause of this immune deficiency is a defect in the presentation of viral antigen due to the failure of naive T cells and antigen-bearing DCs to enter the T cell zones of plt mice. It is also possible that SLC, like some other chemokines, provides a signal that enhances the antigen- dependent activation of lymphocytes (51, 52).

The near-total loss of naive T cell homing in plt mice suggests an absolute requirement for SLC and the existence of at least one function that cannot be performed by ELC.

Although the plt mutation maps to the same genetic locus as SLC and plt mice express no detectable SLC, no DNA abnormality has been identified in these mice. Based on mapping data, the distance between the plt mutation and the SLC gene is between 1 and 1,000 kb. Given their normal SLC intron and exon sequences, we believe that the most likely cause of the lack of SLC expression in plt mice is a mutation involving a cis-acting regulatory region of the SLC gene. Such regions do not have to be in the immediate vicinity of the genes they regulate. For example, the deletion of a region 50 kb upstream of the human \u03b2-globin gene leads to a loss of its expression (53). Because the plt mutation may involve a large deletion in the vicinity of the SLC gene, we cannot rule out the possibility that this defect involves more than one gene.",

(B) Representative FACS\u00ae profile showing a marked decrease of CD11c+ FITC+ cells in plt mice after FITC skin painting. (C) Draining LN cells from FITC-painted mice were partially purified on metrizamide gradients, stained with biotinylated anti\u2013I-Ad followed by SA-PerCP, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Only large FITC+ cells (boxed areas in A) are shown. (D) The number of FITC+ DCs (boxed areas in A) that accumulate in LNs after skin painting with 2 mg FITC is reduced in plt mice. Numbers represent mean \u00b1 SD (n = 8). (E) Comparison of DC content in contralateral (CLN) and draining (DLN) inguinal LNs in mice painted on one flank with 0.2 mg FITC. Single cell suspensions were prepared from individual LNs, stained with anti\u2013I-Ad and anti-B220, and analyzed by flow cytometry gated on I-A+ B220\u2212 cells.",
