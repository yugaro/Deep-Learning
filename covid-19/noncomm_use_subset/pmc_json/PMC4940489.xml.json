A series of negative results does not rule out the possibility of MERS-CoV infection [13]. Possible explanations for false-negative MERS-CoV test results include low viral load very early or late in the illness, inadequate sputum samples due to poor sample collection from patients with dry cough or no cough, inappropriate sample handling or shipping, and technical issues, such as viral genome mutation or PCR inhibition [3]. Sufficient nucleic acid extraction and the removal of substances that inhibit amplification are critical factors influencing the detection of MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR [4]. However, rRT-PCR of sputum samples yields conflicting results owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus. Many reports have indicated that lower respiratory samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and sputum contain the highest viral loads [3567]. However, one report indicated that no significant difference occurred in viral load cycle threshold (Ct) values between sputa and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) []. For this reason, sputum sample homogenization is desirable prior to isolating nucleic acids for MERS-CoV rRT-PCR. In this study, we compared three different sputum homogenization methods and identified an optimal homogenization method prior to the nucleic acid isolation from sputum samples.",

For this reason, we evaluated three homogenization methods using NPA samples that were found to contain various respiratory viruses using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). Next, we evaluated the three homogenization methods using sputum samples spiked with a 1:10 or 1:1,000 dilution of viral culture mixed with an identical volume of sputum. Finally, we evaluated each homogenization method using virus-spiked sputum samples prepared by adding one volume of 1:100 diluted inactivated viral culture to nine volumes of clinical sample (i.e., sputum or BAL).",

The enzyme cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to carboxylic group of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids and is useful for the general digestion of proteins in biological samples. Moreover, proteinase K degrades any RNases present in samples, preventing RNA degradation. Viral nucleic acids are protected from DNase I degradation by the viral protein capsids, although some enveloped viruses may be lost [12]. The genomes of DNA viruses such as adenovirus and bocavirus can be affected by proteinase K and DNase I, possibly owing to the digestion of viral capsid proteins by proteinase K and subsequent degradation of genomic DNA by DNase I.",

However, other viral respiratory pathogens and bacterial pathogens should be considered during diagnosis [3].

Because the ability to detect DNA respiratory viruses can be reduced by DNase I treatment, proteinase K treatment alone is worth considering for the routine detection of respiratory viruses from sputum samples.",

            "text": "The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that respiratory samples be extracted by using either the NucliSENS easyMAG system or MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation kit [2]. Sputum samples categorized into groups 4\u20135 according to Murray and Washington's grading system [9] usually cannot undergo automated extraction owing to high viscosity and, thus, require a pre-homogenization process. Treatment with PBS or NALC and sodium citrate occasionally produces false-negative results with purulent sputum. Adding PBS and mixing via vortexing are necessary to culture respiratory viruses from sputum, and this procedure offers the advantage of involving minimum sample handling. However, thoroughly homogenizing thick or purulent sputum using this method is problematic. Because viral isolation by cell culture is not recommended for the routine confirmation of cases of MERS-CoV [23], the PBS plus vortexing method for processing sputum samples is not suitable for detecting MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR. Previously, it was reported that NALC and sodium citrate treatment (without NaOH) did not damage mycobacterial mRNA or rRNA in sputum samples [13]. NALC and sodium citrate solutions are readily available in clinical microbiology laboratories. Treatment with NALC and sodium citrate solution resulted in complete homogenization of sputum samples, including purulent sputum. However, this method is not suitable for detecting RNA targets in purulent sputum. Because proteinase K treatment requires heat inactivation of potential pathogens (incubation for 15 min at 55\u2103), this method offers additional laboratory safety.",
