Malaria is usually an acute febrile illness with symptoms such as fever, headache and chills typically appearing 10\u201315 days after the individual has been infected. If not treated within 24 h, cases of P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and even death [1, 3].",

It was estimated that 435 000 deaths from malaria had occurred in 2017 globally [4]. Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria continues to have a devastating impact on human health around the world [5]. China has a long history of struggling with infectious diseases, and historically, malaria had been widespread in China, especially in the early 1970s. Over the past decades, China has adopted comprehensive intervention policies and strategies [6, 7].",

As of 2000, eight countries had eliminated malaria, and many other countries had reduced the transmission to low levels (<100 indigenous malaria cases per year) [5]. In 2016, China was identified as one of the 21 countries that had the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020 [3]. To meet the certification criteria for malaria elimination, a country must prove that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide (i.e., reducing the rate of malaria cases to zero) for at least three consecutive years. Continued measures are required to prevent the re-establishment of transmission [3, 8].",

Overall, the incidence of malaria decreased with an AAPC of \u221211.4% (\u221216.6 to \u22126.0). The highest incidence occurred in 1970, which was 2905.704 per 100 000 (Fig. 1). Since the 1970s, the incidence of malaria has decreased rapidly with an APC of \u221223.9% (t = \u221218.4, P < 0.05). A total of 36 085 deaths attributed to malaria were reported during the observational period (1950\u20132016), with an annualised average deaths of 530 (525\u2013536). Most cases of death occurred in the 1950s, and the highest mortality was observed in 1955 (8.994 per 1 000 000). Since 1980, the annual number of malaria deaths has been under 100, and the mortality rate has been under 0.1 per 1 000 000. The overall trend of mortality decreased from 1950 to 2016 (AAPC: \u22128.7%, \u221213.7 to \u22123.4), and the reduction continued over the last 50 years (APC: \u22126.9%, \u22128.4 to \u22125.4).\n",

The rates were under 1 per 100 000 in Chongqing, Neimenggu, Ningxia, Heilongjiang, Qinghai and Jilin (Table 1). Epidemics of malaria were disproportionate in different provinces and areas, and overall, districts in southern China suffered more disease burden than did other areas. The incidence rates in most provinces and areas decreased, and the AAPC values were significant (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The annualised average mortality rate in Yunnan was the highest (3.466 per 1 000 000), and the rates in some districts, such as Guizhou, Zhejiang, Guangxi and Guangdong, were more than 1 per 1 000 000 (Table 1). Mortality cases were concentrated in southern China in the 1950s. The mortality rates have been under 1 per 1 000 000 approximately since the 1970s across China (Supplementary Fig. S1).
