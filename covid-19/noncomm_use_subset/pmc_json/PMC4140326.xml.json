The ad read, Do you have the flu? Fever, Chest discomfort, Weakness, Aches, Headache, Cough? and provided a link to a generic patient education website. Eysenbach aggregated daily statistics on impressions and clicks provided by Google to match the time periods of the weekly national FluWatch reports. The number of advertising clicks correlated better with flu events than flu-like illness (ILI) reports from sentinel physicians. Internet clicks also were a timelier marker than these reports in that they performed better in predicting the flu events of the following week. Correlation coefficients in the reports from sentinel physicians were better for the status of the current week than for predicting the following week. A study conducted by Polgreen et al.7 also examined the occurrence of ILI and flu as related to information collated by an Internet search engine. They used Yahoo to predict an increase in culture positive for flu 1-3 weeks in advance.7 Their model was predicated on the theory that the pattern of how and when people search may provide clues or early indications about future health-related concerns and expectations.7 For instance, when someone believes himself to be sick, he will first search on the internet for disease-related symptoms related to his symptoms before checking in with a public health professional or physician. In developing their model, Polgreen et al. determined whether there was a relationship between the web-based search terms related to a disease and the actual cases of disease.7 In order to relate the search data to a measure of the actual occurrence of flu, the investigators used reports generated by clinical laboratories (members of the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System) that compiled the total number of respiratory specimens that were positive for the disease.7 The web-based search data were compiled at national level and included queries that contained information pertinent to seasonal flu events. Specific census regions were studied that identified the geographical location of origin of the Internet protocol addresses conducting the searches.7 The two sets of data were then correlated and compared. A positive relationship was found between the fraction of flu-related queries and rates of cultures positive for flu two weeks later.7",

These limitations may be corrected by extending the duration of future studies and restricting data sources to websites dedicated solely to medical information, such as WebMD and MD Consult.7 While future studies may refine existing techniques, such refinements do not address the fact that data collected on searches might not have always represented an actual geographical location as per a specific census region.7 In order to address this issue, search data must be analysed with a greater degree of specificity.
