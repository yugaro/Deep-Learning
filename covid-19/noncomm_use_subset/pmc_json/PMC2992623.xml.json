Grass-roots CSOs are often unregistered or are registered with the Ministry of Industrial and Commerce (MOIC), but only CSOs registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) are legally recognized in China: therefore, in this article, these grass-roots CSOs will be referred to as \u2018unregistered CSOs\u2019. However, organizations at all levels are today involved in the national AIDS response.

The speech encouraged all regions and departments to explore new and innovative ideas and develop policy measures to create environments and conditions feasible for societal involvement.5 More recently, prior to World AIDS Day, 2009, President Hu Jintao pledged to mobilize the whole society to improve HIV/AIDS control.

In addition, only one CSO working on an issue is allowed to register at each administrative level and groups working on the same issue in different places are prohibited from coming together as a regional, provincial or national organization. Difficulties in obtaining registration with MOCA have resulted in most grass-roots CSOs remaining unregistered or registering as commercial entities, which makes them liable to pay a 5% tax on any revenue, even for funds received for non-profit purposes.",

From a review of 35 CSOs in four provinces carried out by the NCAIDS in 2009, more than 20 unregistered CSOs working on HIV/AIDS have annual budgets of \u223cUSD7000. Only four organizations have budgets of between USD20 000 and USD150 000. Furthermore, unregistered CSOs are typically unable to manage their own finances and bank accounts, making it difficult for them to mobilize large-scale resources. Additionally, funds directly managed by the NCAIDS, including from international sources such as the Global Fund and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation programme, are administered following government regulations, which means funds can only be used for activities and not staff salaries or operational costs.

The assessment compared PLHIV on treatment in Red Ribbon Centers with non-Red Ribbon sites in two provinces (Yunnan and Guangxi) and found the ACC model to have a positive impact on ART adherence.

Trained MSM volunteers carry out pre- and post-test confidential counselling with those visiting the centre. Medical personnel from the local CDC and local infectious disease hospital then carry out collection of blood samples at the VCT centre, which are delivered to the Chengdu City CDC on a weekly basis for testing.

The extent of involvement of CSOs is reflected in the increased number of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS and engagement in practically all fields related to HIV/AIDS efforts. Moreover, evidence of the impact of CSOs on programme outcomes are also becoming available, further cementing their legitimacy as implementers in the AIDS response. However, a restrictive legal environment for CSOs in general, inadequate access to resources and a generally low capacity of many CSOs could jeopardize the opportunity of civil society to fulfil its full potential as a partner in the AIDS response.",

However, policies for registration and sustainable financial support to CSOs need to be developed in order for CSOs to fulfil their full potential as partners in the AIDS response.Community-based organizations have significantly increased their participation in and contribution to AIDS programmes in China.Supportive policies to engage community-based organizations are needed to enable them to play an even greater role in the future.",
