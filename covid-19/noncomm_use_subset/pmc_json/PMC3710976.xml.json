While these interventions are based on sound infection control principles, evaluating their efficacy in trials is difficult and the published literature on norovirus outbreaks does not provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of infection control measures.5 In observational studies early ward closure has been shown to shorten the mean duration of outbreaks.6\n7 There is also evidence that vomiting and the resultant aerosols are important in transmitting the infection. People exposed to vomiting events, either by being close to the person who initially vomited, or by occupying the same area sometime after the initial event, have a higher infection risk.8\u201311 However, these analyses are based on single outbreaks or events that led to subsequent disease. Improved understanding of how norovirus spreads in closed environments could lead to better infection control procedures.",

It makes use of methods developed for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) transmission and later applied to norovirus.12\u201315 If we knew with certainty who acquired infection from whom it would be straightforward to quantify the role of proximity in norovirus outbreaks, for example, by using regression analysis. However, in practice, transmission events are unobserved, so instead we consider all possible infection trees consistent with the data. We used a previously described approach to calculate the probability, \u03c0ij, that patient i was infected by patient j for each pair of infected patients in each outbreak based on onset times and the serial interval distribution (the serial interval is the time from onset of symptoms in case i to case j), without using proximity data. The serial interval distribution tells us the probability of durations of 0, 1, 2\u2026 days between onset in a case and onset in secondary cases infected by this case. Given multiple possible sources for a case, we can use knowledge of this distribution to tell us how likely each is to be the true source.

We compared this observed metric with values obtained if proximity was not associated with transmission. This distribution was derived by performing random permutations of the bays of the patients in each outbreak and calculating Pk as above for each outbreak. These values were again summed to give an overall proximity metric, S, when proximity was by assumption not an important factor. We repeated this for 1000 random permutations of the patient bays to obtain 1000 sampled proximity metrics. These 1000 S values therefore represent a sample from the distribution of proximity metrics that would be expected if proximity played no role in spreading the disease during the outbreak. By comparing the 1000 sampled values of S with the observed value P we can evaluate whether transmission is more (or less) likely to occur between patients in close proximity. If proximity is unimportant the observed value of P would be unlikely to be in the tails of the distribution of S. If proximity leads to increased transmission the observed value of P would tend to be greater than most of the sampled S values. If proximity leads to decreased transmission (which could occur as a result of enhanced hygiene measures, eg,) the observed value of P is likely to be smaller than most of the sampled S values. Formally, we can perform a two-sided hypothesis test with a null hypothesis that proximity is not important where the p value is given by the proportion of sampled S values which are the more extreme than the value observed, P.",

In other words, transmission of norovirus infections is more likely to occur among patients sharing a bay, compared with transmission among patients in different bays. While this might at first seem an obvious finding, there are competing theories about the transmission of the virus in complex healthcare settings. For example, transmission might occur through staff transferring virus on their hands or patients touching infected surfaces with their hands when moving around the wards or the hospital. The strength of our conclusion is sensitive to the assumed serial interval distribution. We used values derived from the dates of onset of illness in patients during outbreaks on hospital wards. We also performed sensitivity analysis using a serial interval distribution derived from a study of norovirus in children.13 However, because the degree to which this generalises to a hospital setting is unclear (intuitively the high contact rates in hospitals would be expected to lead to shorter serial intervals)17 we explored serial intervals from 0.5 to 4 days, while constraining the variance. Our results show that for serial intervals of less than 2 days the observed effect of proximity (sharing a bay with someone else who was ill) is highly significant (p<0.001) and for serial intervals up to 2.5 days remained significant at the 5% level. This pattern was similar whether using the observed serial interval distribution from the outbreak data or using a parametric probability distribution.",

Although data collection were standardised it is often difficult to assess the accuracy of the date and place that patients were when they became ill. Specifically, accurate information on patients\u2019 positions on a ward was available for 44% of the outbreaks. The spatial analysis was undertaken on 65 outbreaks. In addition to the sensitivity analysis we also analysed the data by including outbreaks where onset dates of illness were complete but data on patient location were incomplete (where fewer than 10% of patient data on position was incomplete, 85 outbreaks). We dealt with missing values by allocating a completely separate bay for patients with missing data on location at time of onset. This approach is conservative in that it would underestimate the impact of proximity. Second, we removed the patients from the outbreaks if positional information was missing. Despite this limitation, the additional models indicated that that the results are robust to different assumptions about missing data which is evidenced by slightly higher probabilities obtained when using records with complete information only (see online supplementary table S1 and figure S1). As a check to demonstrate that the results were not an artefact of the statistical methods, we also ran the models on data where patient position was randomly assigned. This showed no pattern and the proximity measures were not significant for any of these models. In our analysis the estimation of Pk depends on outbreak size. However, we are not interested in the absolute values of P, only in how the value of P calculated with real proximity data compares with the value calculated with randomly generated proximity data (based on a permutation of the bay identities) which will be affected in the same way by outbreak sizes. We also performed a sensitivity analysis, normalising Pk by dividing it by the number of branches in the transmission tree for each network. This gives equal weight to each outbreak and allows Pk to be interpreted as the probability that two linked cases were in the same bay. This did not change the results of the analysis; the P metric still fell well outside of the measure one would expect from the random simulations (p=0.004, data not shown).",
