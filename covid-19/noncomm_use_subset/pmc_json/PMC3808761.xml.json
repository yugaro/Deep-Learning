This new approach aims to semiquantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well established in the social sciences to display different characteristics, which in its sum will give a pictorial and semiquantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based on biological and epidemiological criteria, the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision but will allows it to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterise a specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but it tends to suggest a precision not supported by the available evidence. Thus, the visual impression resulting from the connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a tendency to quickly support decision-making while leaving enough room for the decision-makers to take other important issues into account. In addition, the disease-specific epidemiological criteria of the CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.",

Indicating the medians as well as the minimum and maximum point estimates would be an alternative approach. Both approaches have their advantages. Even the objective to give a semiquantitative account of the degree of uncertainty might be questioned. But we preferred to show the degree of uncertainty inherent in each decisive criterion by displaying the range of values through whiskers (median of the highest and lowest rankings of aggregated experts\u2019 opinions). Considering that some criteria have a lesser degree of uncertainty than others and that some users might not consider the degree of uncertainty at all, we believe our approach is more suitable.",

Nine days later, she is being diagnosed with disease X. Her medical record is uneventful; she reports excellent health in the previous three years. She describes symptom onset of cough just before boarding the bus. During the 9.5 hour trip, she had kept to herself listening to music in the back of the bus. The coach company does not keep passenger lists on this route but estimates that there were a total of 12 persons aboard. They confirm that air conditioning with partial air exchange is in use on all vehicles and therefore windows remain closed at all times. No further information is available.If in this scenario the disease is infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (Figure 3) the completed CT-RAP indicates that a contact investigation could be given further consideration. Taking identical circumstances, i.ethe same setting etc., but replacing infectious pulmonary tuberculosis with meningococcal disease, the connecting line on the disease specific CT-RAP signals that contact tracing might be much less called for (Figure 4).",
