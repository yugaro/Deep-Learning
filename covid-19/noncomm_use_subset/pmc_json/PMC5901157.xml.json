The primary outcome was to estimate the types of respiratory viruses triggering bronchiolitis. In addition, we examined the trend in RSV over the different months. Test for seasonality was evaluated by fitting the data to a series of Box\u2013Jenkins regression-autoregressive integrated moving average models. These models are stochastic models in that describe a univariate time series as a function of its past values. To test the null hypothesis that no seasonality was present, the likelihood ratio statistic was used. The autoregressive integrated moving average model procedure estimates the equivalent of the least-square parameter estimates of a regression model when the data are time series and the error term is an autoregressive process. Pictorial presentations of the key results were made using appropriate statistical graphs. All statistical analyses were done using statistical packages SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).",

Despite the seasonal peaks, it is obvious that RSV bronchiolitis can infect young children throughout the year. In addition, the mean LOS due to RSV was found to be 8 days, which almost double the days required for young children with H1N1 bronchiolitis to be discharged from our medical institution. This could be perhaps attributed to the use of the H1N1 vaccine on most children as well as medications such oseltamivir for acute infections. In the developed countries, the mean LOS in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis is 6 days. The USA mean average is 4 days, while Germany reports 9 days.15 Our results are comparable to that of West Europe.",
