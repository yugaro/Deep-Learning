It has a small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that encodes three open reading frames [ORFs] (25). Individual FCV isolates may differ, but they all belong to a single serotype (25). Clinical disease caused by FCV is typically characterized by oral ulcerations with or without mild respiratory and conjunctival signs (25). The virus has also been associated with the presence of transient and shifting lameness, hemorrhagic-like fever (21), abortion (5) and chronic stomatitis (16). Following recovery from acute disease, cats may become a carrier, effectively shedding the virus from the oropharynx (24, 31). The duration of this carrier state is variable and ranges from months to years in individual animals (9). Higher prevalence of FCV has been associated with cats of less than 12 months and households were large number of cats are housed together (2, 3, 30).",

Only one serotype of this virus exists, and like other alphaherpesvirus, FHV-1 induces latency in nervous ganglions (11). Thus, clinically recovered cats are carriers that undergo periodic episodes of virus reactivation, particularly after stress (11). In both experimental and natural infections, symptoms include the following: depression, sneezing, inappetence, pyrexia and serous ocular and nasal discharges (11). Cats of any age, sex or breed are susceptible, but a severe syndrome is usually restricted to kittens of up to six months of age (23). It is estimated that more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV; and that a minimum of eighty percent remains latently infected with 45% shedding the virus by all life long (18).",

Vaccinations may have reduced the overall severity of disease; however, in some vaccinated individuals, disease may still occur (11, 25, 29). Commercially available vaccines are generally safe and protect reasonably well against disease, although they do not prevent infection, the shedding of virus or even the development of the carrier state (9, 11, 20, 25). Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available (11, 25), and vaccine virus shedding after vaccination has been described experimentally only for a temperature sensitive FHV-1 vaccine (33). In that case, vaccine virus has been shed for 25 days after vaccination (33).",

However, to our knowledge, there has not yet been a described isolation of FHV-1 in Brazil. Regardless, evidence of the presence of both viruses has been obtained from serologic surveys performed in populations of wild (6, 27) and domestic felines (14). The aim of the present study was to generate insights into the epidemiology of FCV and FHV-1 in the southern part of Brazil. Thus, conjunctival, nasal, oral and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 302 cats in several counties in Rio Grande do Sul State, and the resulting isolation and identification of FCV and FHV-1 are described.",

A greater prevalence of FCV in comparison to FHV-1 has been reported in cats with clinical manifestations of disease as well for clinically healthy cats (2, 16), although it has been shown that FHV-1 isolation is generally related to the presence of clinical signs, whereas FCV is not (12). Furthermore, FHV-1 is the virus most commonly identified when respiratory clinical manifestations are observed (7, 13, 16, 34); in the present study, signs of respiratory disease were present in 24 out of the 25 sick cats from which FCV, FHV-1 or both were isolated. Conversely, FCV was present in samples from the three cats showing signs of oral lesions in this study (data not shown), which matches results from other studies that have associated oral ulcers more consistently with FCV infection (25, 26, 34).",

This vaccination likely contributed to the reduction of the number of cats in the population excreting FHV-1 but did not significantly affect the number of cats excreting FCV (12). The biology of the viruses is one characteristic that could contribute to this finding; FCV is an RNA virus with wide genetic and antigenic diversity, whereas FHV-1 is a stable DNA virus (25). In this article, the number of vaccinated cats excreting FHV-1 was higher than that excreting FCV (Table 2). However, it should be noted that there was a unique situation in this study that could cause such results. Most of the isolated FHV-1 came from breeding catteries where an outbreak of respiratory disease was occurring. Thus, many of the FHV-1-isolated cats came from the same location; furthermore, most of the vaccinated cats used in this study came from the same cattery.",

Again, virus biology is the most probable explanation for these results because FCV carriers excrete the virus continuously, whereas FHV-1 carriers excrete the virus only when it is reactivated (11, 13, 25). The percentages of isolation were roughly 60% for FCV and 27% for FHV-1 (Table 2). A comparison with other data shows only that FCV is more commonly isolated than FHV-1 because the prevalence detected varied as much as 15 to 25% for FCV and 0.2 to 33.3% for FHV-1 in one study (12) to 25% for FCV and 0.6% for FHV-1 in another study (3).",

Nonetheless, there are other causes for respiratory and ocular diseases in felines other than FCV and FHV-1, including agents such as fungi, bacteria and other viruses (10). Chlamydophila felis is a bacteria routinely identified in cases of conjunctival disease in cats. Bordetella spp., which is associated with mild respiratory signs, is also commonly identified (2).

Furthermore, another important characteristic of the Brazilian cat population is that most cats, even ones with owners, live outside.

Such animals could be a source of infection, particularly for kittens.
