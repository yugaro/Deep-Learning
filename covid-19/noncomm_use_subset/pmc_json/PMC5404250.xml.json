There are 1,251 microbiological laboratories in a tiered system that addresses medical, agricultural, food, and environmental needs. This tiered system includes 31 national labs, 23 local health bureau labs (regional level), 405 hospital labs (regional level), 530 university and research institute labs (district level), and 262 private labs (district level). Among them, numerous laboratories are involved in testing for various notifiable diseases and/or monitoring infectious pathogens; of these, 12 are national labs in TCDC, 7 are designated labs (national or regional level), 16 are commissioned labs (regional level), and 289 are authorized labs (regional and district levels) that are distributed over the country in medical centers, regional hospitals, local health bureaus, district hospitals, private testing institutes, and clinics (Figure 1). There is also a national BSL-4 laboratory in northern Taiwan affiliated with the National Defense Medical Center that serves as a designated lab. The national labs serve as reference centers for the fields of virology, bacteriology, parasitology, mycology, and vector biology (Figure 2). Designated, commissioned, and authorized labs in regional and district levels are dedicated to routine disease diagnosis in the country.",

In terms of notifiable diseases belonging to categories 1 and 5 (12 diseases)\u2014highly contagious, newly emerging infectious diseases that could result in a substantial impact on the health of the human population, such as avian influenza, Zika, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)\u2014clinical specimens from suspicious patients are collected and packaged in local clinics and hospitals and sent to designated or TCDC laboratories for diagnosis. For positive specimens tested by designated laboratories, final confirmation by TCDC is required (Figure 3A). A similar system has been established for diagnosis of the 54 diseases belonging to categories 2, 3, and 4, with a slight difference. Once the clinical specimens from clinics and hospitals are collected and packaged, they are sent to authorized or TCDC laboratories.

However, the continuously evolving nature of the virus reduces vaccine effectiveness; therefore, antigens for global seasonal influenza vaccines must be reformulated annually.10,11 To capture the dynamic pattern of the circulating influenza virus strains in a real-time manner, the national laboratory surveillance network of influenza viruses in Taiwan, which monitors the country's outpatients with influenzalike illness in the community and hospitalized patients with severe complications, was established and coordinated by TCDC. The regional commissioned laboratories are located in the northern (n = 3), central (n = 2), southern (n = 2), and eastern (n = 1) parts of Taiwan, and they continually conduct influenza testing for clinical specimens taken from ill people in the community and collect viral isolates from infected outpatients. Viruses infecting inpatients with severe complications must be detected and isolated by authorized and TCDC laboratories, as severe complicated influenza is a category 4 notifiable disease in Taiwan. Isolated influenza viruses are sent to the National Influenza Center (NIC) at TCDC for further analysis by detailed virologic assays on viral genetic and antigenic properties to monitor types and subtypes, lineage, and genetic and antigenic changes of circulating viruses, to detect antiviral resistance, and to identify novel influenza viruses (Figure 4).",

Based on the long-term monitoring of collected isolates, TCDC can delineate the epidemiologic pattern of circulating viruses in a real-time manner, which clearly shows annual peaks in winter dominated by various virus types or subtypes; summer influenza peaks are usually observed as well (Figure 6A). In addition, phylogenetic analysis of viral surface hemagglutinin (HA) genes is used to explore the genetic relationship between domestic circulating viruses and annual global vaccine strains (Figures 6B-E). Combined with data on viral antigenic characterization determined by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the vaccine mismatch rate of the H3N2 subtype in Taiwan is higher than those of the H1N1pdm09 and influenza B viruses (Table 1). This supports past research showing that a higher genetic mutation rate was observed among the H3N2 viruses.12,13 Furthermore, successful examples of the laboratory surveillance system to promote health security include the timely detection of a new variant of H3N2 strain that caused a mismatch in the 2009-10 northern hemisphere winter vaccine, and also the research data reporting virologic factors that may have contributed to the previous large epidemic waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B viruses that occurred in Taiwan.14-16",

However, they harbor markers related to enhanced polymerase activity (the 627K or 701N in the polymerase basic protein 2) and high-affinity binding of virus to human receptors (the 226L in the hemagglutinin protein), suggesting their better replication and infection capabilities in human population.25 One virus also has markers that may confer oseltamivir resistance (the 292K in the neuraminidase protein). Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship of viral full-genome sequences reveals that these 4 viruses were generated through various reassortment events in China, indicating their complex evolutionary history.25 These findings are consistent with the initial viral characteristics reported by other research groups at the early stage of H7N9 outbreaks in China.31",

On May 8, 2013, an influenza A virus isolated from the inpatient's throat swab specimen was identified by a regional authorized laboratory using an immunofluorescence assay. However, subsequent analyses by subtype-specific PCR assays showed negative results for human H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses.",

After results of H1, H3, H5, H7, and H9 molecular diagnoses were all negative, the virus was further identified as the H6N1 subtype based on sequence analysis of its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Subsequently, TCDC developed the molecular diagnostic method and conducted enhanced active surveillance. From June 10 to August 13, a total of 125 individuals with influenzalike illness or pneumonia were reported; all of their respiratory specimens tested negative for H6N1. Six symptomatic contacts were identified, and serological analyses of the paired serum specimens collected from those contacts also showed undetectable antibody titers (\u226610) against the H6N1 virus, while titers of the first and second serum specimens of the index case were 40 and 80, respectively.26 Therefore, no additional H6N1-infected cases were identified.",

Since then, TCDC and Taiwan Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) have collaborated closely to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for this virus strain. After gathering the sequences of chicken H6N1 viruses circulating in Taiwan from AHRI, results of phylogenetic analyses showed that the human H6N1 virus was highly homologous to domestic chicken H6N1 viruses, especially to the strain isolated in the same year (2013). Since all 8 viral gene segments could be traced back to several older chicken H6N1 viruses, we propose that the human H6N1 virus was generated through multiple reassortment events in chickens in Taiwan and then infected the human case. Furthermore, genetic analysis showed that the virus has the marker related to high-affinity binding of viruses to human receptors (the 228S in the hemagglutinin protein), suggesting its better adaptation to the human population.26",

Similar to the global influenza surveillance and response system (GISRS) operated by the WHO, the national laboratory influenza surveillance system in Taiwan continuously monitors the evolution and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses to evaluate possible risks caused by their dynamically changing nature and provides laboratory diagnostics to maintain the sustainable detection capacity of the lab system.
