The etiological agents of CAP are varied. Bacterial agents known to cause CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus in\ufb02uenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.2, 3, 4 Viral agents, such as in\ufb02uenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parain\ufb02uenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, adenovirus, and rhinovirus are also common.5, 6, 7 CAP can also be caused by emerging respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus,8 human coronaviruses NL639 and HKU1,10 and human bocavirus11 have been reported as etiological agents of CAP.",

However, it is time-consuming and it takes 7\u201312 days to obtain a positive culture. Enzyme immunoassays and immunofluorescence give rapid results, but, their relative lack of sensitivity and the availability of reactive antisera can be limiting factors.14 Advances in conventional RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR assays have greatly facilitated the etiological study of respiratory infections due to their higher sensitivity and specificity. These assays can also reduce labor and cost by detecting more than one pathogen in a single reaction by using multiple probes.15 There are several commercial multiplex assays available; such as xTAG RVP from Luminex, Multicode-PLx RVP from EraGen Biosciences, and ResPlex II from Qiagen. These assays have been used for broad spectrum detection of respiratory viruses with high cost and they are time-consuming.",
