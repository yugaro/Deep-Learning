Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been described as an early sensitive and specific marker for bacterial pneumonia in bronchoalveolar lavages of mechanically ventilated adults, and as a severity marker of meningococcal disease in children.17 18 In 2016, a study was published that showed that PTX3 levels are also a marker for LRTI in children and is more sensitive than C reactive protein (CRP), which is frequently used in clinical care.19 No correlation between CRP levels and severity of viral disease has been described. When CRP levels are very high, they indicate bacterial infection; however, often, CRP is moderately increased and then CRP is not able to differentiate between viral or bacterial aetiology of infection.20\u201323 Serum amyloid A (SAA) appears to be more sensitive than CRP for the detection of bacterial infections in neonates, although it is not used in daily practice.24 The SAA/CRP ratio can be used as a marker for severe disease in children with bacterial infections.25 Nakayama et al have shown that SAA levels increase in children with different viral infections, including viral LRTI. However, an association with disease severity was not established.26 Serum amyloid P component (SAP) can activate the classical complement pathway and interacts with mannan-binding lectin. SAP is part of a family of pattern recognition receptors, the pentraxin family. CRP and PTX3 belong to the same family. SAP is involved in inflammation and used as a marker for atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease.27 Skinner et al have shown that SAP levels were not increased during bacterial pneumonia, suggesting a limited potential as biomarker in infectious disease.28 No studies were found that assessed the role of SAP during viral infections; since its family members show potential as biomarker in viral disease, we decided to include SAP in this study.",

In the context of kidney disease, the role of properdin is becoming more apparent; moreover it has been demonstrated that properdin can be activated via neutrophil extracellular traps.

Symptoms included signs of increased respiratory effort (eg, tachypnoea and/or use of accessory respiratory muscles or retractions) and/or expiratory wheezing and/or crackles on auscultation and/or apnoea. Patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, immunosuppressive medication (including >24 hours of corticosteroids) or severe psychomotor retardation were excluded. Eligible patients were identified by their physician who diagnosed a viral LRTI and notified the study team. In both hospitals, it was not common practice to perform laboratory, rontgen or viral diagnostics at time of presentation; therefore, inclusions were made based on clinical appearance. When informed consent of both parents was obtained within 24 hours of admission, patients were included in the study. Data on clinical parameters, course of disease, medical history and demographics were retrieved from medical records and questionnaires retrieved at inclusion and after 4\u20136 weeks. Participation in this study did not influence medical care, and study results from individual patients were not shared with the medical team. Retrospectively, after discharge patients were allocated into three groups: mild, send home or only clinical observation; moderate, patients with need for supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding; and severe, patients with mechanical ventilation. Supplemental oxygen was started according to the protocols from the clinical wards in patients with an oxygen saturation of \u226492% for at least 10 min after use of decongestives. Results were evaluated in a training cohort (n=104, 2010\u20132012) and subsequently tested in a larger historical validation cohort with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria (n=141, 2006\u20132009).

The increase of CRP and SAA levels during viral infection was known and this was also the reason to include the proteins in our study. We were able to confirm the work of Huttunen et al that the ratio SAA/CRP is significantly decreased in patients with severe disease compared with patients with mild and moderate disease (data not shown).25 Moreover, CRP and SAA levels both correlated with severity of viral LRTIs and CRP was also correlated with length of hospitalisation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings have not been described before. The increase in PTX3 levels during more severe disease and a correlation with need for supplemental oxygen show the potential of PTX3 as biomarker for viral LRTI in children. This was already proposed by others, who saw a correlation with peak temperature, duration of fever and presence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.17 19 Although SAP levels significantly increase during infection, no correlation could be observed with disease severity in children with viral LRTI. Therefore, it appears that SAP could not be used as a biomarker for disease severity in viral or bacterial infections.28 This study is the first to describe the remarkable kinetics of CFP (properdin) levels, which decrease during severe viral infection in children. We were unable to find an explanation in the literature. However, since CFP levels restored in the available recovery samples, a deficiency is highly unlikely. Other possible explanations for the decrease might be consumption, as occurs with other complement factors, or an unrecognised bacterial coinfection. Although cultures were routinely taken at the intensive care unit before the start of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) antibiotics, bacterial infections cannot be ruled out completely. A subanalysis of patients with (n=10) and without (n=15) positive bacterial cultures on the ICU showed no difference in protein levels (data not shown). During the study period, SDD was standard practice in the ICU and, therefore, all severe patients would have had at least one gift of prophylactic antibiotics before the study samples were taken.",

Moreover, signs and symptoms of children can be ambiguous at the moment of presentation and only become clear after prolonged observation. Prediction rules using clinical data often show a lower AUC and validation studies of these rules are lacking or have a smaller sample size.4 39\n",

This influenced our analyses and hindered the logistic regression analysis in the prediction of mild disease. Since venapuncture is not always part of routine care, especially not in this patient group, parents often refuse participation or the venapuncture specific. Therefore, the performance of our rule in the mild patient group under 2 months of age needs further testing Moreover, a prospective study in which results are available for the clinicians is needed to assess the clinical implications of our rule.",

We could not find correlations in the acute samples after correcting for age and multiple testing; however, we did observe a positive correlation between age and SAA and SAP in the recovery samples (data not shown). This is opposite to our findings during the acute phase of disease (higher levels in younger patients). Bruun et al studied plasma levels of CRP and SAA in children and neonates, including preterms in healthy and diseased state. They demonstrated that with increasing age (preterm up to child), higher CRP and SAA levels are being produced during disease.40 Although when patients were healthy, the differences resolve. It is likely that the higher levels of SAA in our youngest (severely ill) patients is a result of disease severity. This shas already been demonstrated for bacterial infections.24 25 In our linear regression rule, SAA could be replaced with age of the patients which gave similar results.",

It is assumed that some biomarkers precede clinical symptoms and could therefore be used early in the course of disease to predict severe outcomes. The advantage of measuring markers in plasma is the possibility for easy implementation in current diagnostic laboratory settings, relative short time to measure, reproducibility of the assays and available options for standardisation. Moreover, with the use of tools for linear regression modelling, it is easy to add new markers to further optimise the predictive rule. In general, our results indicate that combining markers, in our case inflammatory proteins, could increase the performance of a test. This indicates that this method might also be useful in other settings. More specifically, due to the validation in an independent cohort, we can assume that our decision rule will perform as well in other hospital settings. Whether the combination of these plasma markers could also be used to predict severe bacterial infections need to be assessed in other studies.",

The identification of children with a mild course of disease has more visible consequences, as can be measured in reduced hospitalisation rates or length of stay in the hospital. To truly estimate the value of the markers, a prospective study is needed. However, even before the markers are implemented in the clinic, biomarkers could be used to stratify patients in clinical studies and as secondary end-point in intervention studies. With the current development of point-of-care tests, plasma protein levels can be available within a relevant time frame and could be beneficial for care in emergency rooms and by the general practitioner.",
