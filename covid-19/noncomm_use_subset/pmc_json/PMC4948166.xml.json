For the US and Spain, the events around the EVD cases have raised fundamental questions about the preparedness of the healthcare systems in advanced countries to handle the EVD epidemic, should that occur, despite the rhetorical presentation of their sophistication and invincibility. In Spain, federal authorities have asked for explanations on how the nurse contracted the virus.[3] In the US, the Ebola patient was released from hospital even after he reported that he had travelled from Liberia only to be readmitted when his condition worsened. Hospital and health officials have scrambled to advance such reasons ranging from human error, software malfunction, down to the assertion, in some quarters, that the patient was turned away because he did not have health insurance\u2014the traditional gateway to getting into the healthcare system in the US.[4]",

The fact that these soldiers were deployed by the President without the usual political arguments demonstrates the magnitude of risk perception among US law makers of the epidemic. The US has also instituted increased screening for airline passengers in the US and Africa,[13] a practice that had been in place since the outbreak started by the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Nigeria. The US has also dispatched a team of public health officials to learn how Africa\u2019s most-populous country, Nigeria, and Senegal, among the world\u2019s poorest nation, were able to mitigate the spread of the virus in their countries.[14] The US spends far more on healthcare than the Ebola-hit West African countries combined (see Table 1/Figure 1). The fact that the US is learning from Nigeria and Senegal is instructive.",

IJMA was founded to be \u201ca fertile ground to cultivate a global intellectual coalition to highlight the issues in hinterlands of developing countries.\u201d[15] It is interesting that the US is sending health experts to Nigeria, the global South, to learn from their experience on handling the EVD outbreak.

Global health is local health. It is often disappointing to come across public health experts, policy makers, or academics, who put an artificial divide between population health for those living within and those living beyond their national shores. The realities of the current Ebola epidemic and past disease outbreaks such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome), Bird flu (H5N1 Avian flu), BSE (aka the mad cow disease), etc., present some of the profound reasons to agree that \u201clocal health is global health\u201d and \u201cglobal health is local health.\u201d This theme has not been lost in human ideologies. In 1969, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the first International Health Regulations (IHR), the all-hands-on system designed to prevent national public health emergencies from becoming international crises. The present Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), while implementing the IHR strive to pool human and technical resources in member states from the global North and South.",

It is very often that we see policy makers and public health officials deal with public health issues in the abstract, reeling out mere numbers, policies and layers of guidance, but unfortunately relegating to the background, the public which is the very essence of public and population health. As depicted in the US experience, a sophisticated healthcare system is important in handling an outbreak such as Ebola, but it is not a panacea to dealing with the attendant manageable fallouts of a rapidly unfolding outbreak. The people are. Nigeria\u2019s ability to mitigate the catastrophic outbreak in Africa\u2019s most-populous country was benchmarked on the nation\u2019s ability to mobilize the entire citizenry to participate in the national effort, a practice referred to in the language of epidemiologists as \u201ccontact tracing.\u201d While the country was battling the outbreak, every citizen became the guard and guardian of the entire society.",

People were part of the overall \u201ccontact tracing\u201d by using text messages to contact health officials. The role of the people was so instrumental that, at one time, the country was agog with the notion of a cure for EVD by \u201cbathing with salt.\u201d The fake cure started from a message sent out a local traditional ruler to his by subjects. This single communication went viral on the social media and everyone was bathing with salt water to prevent and or cure EVD. Even as unscientific as this incident is, the fact that this practice went viral within a few hours bears testimony to the level of communal sharing between people, friends, families, colleagues and even strangers during such emergency. This is the \u201cP\u201d in public health in action. It is this \u201cP\u201d in public health that the western health officials must learn from their Nigerian and Senegalese counterparts.[16, 17]",
