Additionally, some ISGs, namely TRIM5 and tetherin, can also exert antiviral effects by signaling to induce other antiviral genes (Gal\u00e3o et al., 2012; Pertel et al., 2011). Thus, response to IFN includes directly antiviral proteins and signal amplifiers that are induced by IFNs (Schoggins et al., 2014, Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006).

Therefore, antiviral protein activity is sometimes revealed by using viral mutants or non-native viral hosts. HIV-1, for example, evades or antagonizes human APOBEC3, TRIM5\u03b1, and tetherin but is fully sensitive to these proteins in non-hominid species (Doyle et al., 2015). Species-dependent variation in antiretroviral proteins can constitute a profound genetic barrier to interspecies retroviral transmission. Accordingly, type I IFN is a significantly more potent inhibitor of HIV-1 and SIV infection in cells of non-native primates (Bitzegeio et al., 2013). Nevertheless, some ISGs exert antiviral effects without evidence for evasion or antagonism by the retroviral target (Doyle et al., 2015).",

First, we used an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (SCRPSY, Figure 1B) to express each ISG along with TagRFP in target cells that were then challenged with GFP-encoding retroviruses or retroviral vectors. Infection was then measured using two-color flow cytometry. This \u201cincoming screening\u201d strategy (Figure 1C) identifies ISGs that inhibit steps in the retroviral life cycle prior to GFP expression. Second, we co-transfected an ISG-expression plasmid (pDEST40) with a plasmid(s) that generates retroviral particles, then measured the yield of infectious virions by transduction of a GFP reporter gene, or using a reporter cell line. This \u201cproduction screening\u201d strategy (Figure 1D) identifies genes that inhibit the latter stages of the retroviral life cycle. For each ISG, the fraction of infected, ISG/TagRFP-expressing cells (incoming screens) or the yield of infectious virions (production screens) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value across all wells in a given screen (Figures 1E, 1F, 2A\u20132G, S1B\u2013S1E, S2, S3, and S4).",

A number of ISGs that were known to have antiretroviral activity, including several APOBEC3 proteins, TRIM5, tetherin, MOV10, SAMHD1, CNP, and Mx2, were identified in the appropriate incoming or production screens (Figures 1, 2, S1, S2, and S3; Table S5), suggesting that this approach is a powerful way to identify antiviral genes. Many additional ISGs whose expression conferred either resistance to incoming retroviral infection or reduced the production of infectious retroviral particles were identified. Some ISGs appeared to be specific inhibitors of one or a few retroviruses, while others were broadly inhibitory. As examples, OASL inhibited the production of infectious prototypic foamy virus (PFV) virions, and ULK4 inhibited the production of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but OASL and ULK4 had no activity against other retroviruses. Conversely, macaque SLFN12 inhibited the production of all retroviruses (Figures 1, 2, S1, S2, and S3; Table S5). Overall, \u223c60% of ISGs were hits against a single retrovirus, and the remainder targeted multiple retroviruses. In general, a greater number of ISGs were more potently inhibitory in production screens than in the incoming screens. This finding may result from potentially higher ISG protein levels associated with transient transfection, or may be due to the greater number and complexity of events associated with the late, as opposed to the early, steps of retroviral replication. A number of ISGs appeared to exert antiretroviral activity in a species-dependent manner. For example, human, but not macaque, ANGTPL1 inhibited SIVmac production, while macaque, but not human, IRF2 inhibited HIV-1 infection in human MT4 cells (Figures S1E\u2013S1F and S4; Table S5). More than one-third of the \u201chits\u201d were identified exclusively using our macaque ISG library (Table S5), but further work is required to determine which of these candidates have genuine species-dependent antiretroviral activity.",

Interestingly, more ISGs were protective in THP-1 cells than in MT4 cells, even though MT4 cells were more efficiently transduced with the ISG-encoding vectors (Figures 1 and S1; Table S2). Ten ISGs conferred >10-fold protection against infection by at least one primate lentivirus in THP-1 cells but conferred minimal or no protection in MT4 cells (Figures 1, S1, S2, and S3). These genes (cGAS, RIPK2, TLR7, IRF7, TRIM5, TRIM38, MYD88, IL1R, LGALS9, and IFI16) included ISGs known to mediate pattern recognition and inflammatory signaling.

However, ISGs with broad activity (e.g., tetherin) can also have important effects. Validation and characterization of all the candidate antiretroviral ISGs identified herein would take many years. We therefore adopted a targeted approach to identify ISGs that (1) act directly to inhibit viral replication or (2) act as regulators of the antiviral state.

Thereafter, we determined infectious titers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 on MT4 and THP-1 cells expressing these ISGs (Figures 3C and 3D). This analysis confirmed the activity of ISGs known to inhibit incoming HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection (such as TRIM5 and Mx2) as well as a number of ISGs for which anti HIV-1 or HIV-2 activity was not previously described (e.g., IDO1, BCL3, LGALS9, and C5orf39) (Figures 3C and 3D). Despite our attempts to focus this sub-screen on directly acting ISGs, several genes that only conferred protection in THP-1 cells, such as cGAS, human TRIM5, and TLRs 3 and 7, likely act by inducing an antiviral state, even though they did not activate IFN\u03b2 or ISRE reporters (Figures 3A and 3B). Nevertheless, one ISG that had anti-HIV-1 activity only in THP-1 cells, CDKN1A, may exert its effect by decreasing SAMHD1 phosphorylation (Pauls et al., 2014). Thus, certain ISGs may exert antiretroviral activity, contingent on cofactors that are expressed in a cell-type-dependent manner.",

This finding suggested that IDO1 inhibits HIV-1 through L-Trp catabolites or by L-Trp depletion, rather than the direct action of the IDO1 protein. Moreover, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), a competitive inhibitor of IDO1 enzymatic activity, substantially reversed the anti-HIV-1 effect of IDO1 (Figure 4J). Crucially, L-Trp supplementation fully restored IDO1-inhibited HIV-1 Gag expression and infectious particle generation (Figure 4K). In the absence of IDO1, treatment with 1-MT or additional L-Trp had little influence on infectious progeny virion yield (Figure S5A and S5B).

IDO1 is induced in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) following HIV-1 infection in vivo or IFN\u03b3 stimulation in vitro (Favre et al., 2010), but most immortalized cell lines do not respond to IFN\u03b3 in this way. Therefore, we used A549 cells, which, unusually, exhibit robust IDO1 induction following IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figure 5A). IFN\u03b3 treatment of A549 cells conferred only 2- to 3-fold protection from incoming pseudotyped HIV-1 infection (Figure 5B). In contrast, IFN\u03b3 caused up to 100-fold reduction in HIV-1 infectious virion yield from infected A549 cells in a single cycle of replication (Figure 5C). Addition of L-Trp or 1-MT increased the yield of infectious HIV-1 from IFN\u03b3-treated A549 cells by \u223c10-fold (Figure 5D) but did not have this effect in the absence of IFN\u03b3 (Figure S4C). A similar L-Trp induced rescue of infectious virion yield occurred with IFN\u03b3\u2013treated TZM-bl cells, a commonly used HIV-1 indicator cell line (Figures 5D\u20135F and S5D). Thus, IDO1-induced nutrient (L-Trp) depletion is responsible for a substantial fraction of the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFN\u03b3 in A549 and TZM-bl cells.",

HIV-1 replication in GHOSTX4 cells is resistant to inhibition by IFN\u03b1 (our unpublished data), so this strategy could, in principle, capture ISGs that regulate the antiviral state, or directly inhibit late HIV-1 replication steps. Most of the selected ISGs modestly inhibited HIV-1 replication GHOSTX4 cells (Figures 6A and 6B), but one ISG, TRIM56, substantially delayed HIV-1 spread (Figure 6A). TRIM56 has previously been reported to inhibit the replication of some, but not all, RNA viruses through mechanisms that are unclear (Liu et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2011). In our screens, TRIM56 greatly inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 and HERV-K virions and exhibited weak activity against HIV-2 in incoming screens (Figures 1E, 1F, and 2D).",

Further analysis of chimeric viruses containing elements from 3\u2032R indicated that the TRIM56 resistant phenotype could not be mapped to a single determinant (our unpublished data). Nevertheless, a single substitution in the HIV-1 Env gene (T6421A, Env N67K) present in 3\u2032R enabled some level of replication in GHOSTX4-TRIM56 cells (Figure 7B). When the T6421A mutation was combined with mutations in 5\u2032R (generating HIV-1 5\u2032R-6421), the HIV-1/TRIM56R virus phenotype was reproduced. Attempts to map determinants within 5\u2032R conferring TRIM56 resistance upon HIV-1 5\u2032R-6421 again indicated that multiple determinants in 5\u2032R contributed to the HIV-1/TRIM56R phenotype (our unpublished data).

A microarray analysis of the four control and sevevn TRIM56 knockout MT4 clones, focusing on the 120 most highly IFN\u03b1-induced ISGs, revealed that, despite variation among individual cell clones, basal ISG expression (i.e., in the absence of IFN) was generally unaffected by TRIM56 (Figure 7F). In contrast, following IFN\u03b1 treatment, many ISGs were expressed at higher levels in control than in TRIM56 knockout clones (Figure 7G). These genes included several that were hits in our screens (Figure 1C), as well as known antiretroviral genes, including APOBEC3G, Mx2, MOV10, and IFITM3. Analysis of a larger set of 500 ISGs (Figures S7C and S7D) confirmed that TRIM56 knockout reduced ISG expression following IFN\u03b1 treatment. Thus, TRIM56 likely enhances the antiretroviral activity of IFN\u03b1, at least in part, by enhancing cellular responsiveness to this cytokine.",

Previously, we conducted a narrowly focused incoming screen that tested the ability of human ISGs to inhibit HIV-1 (Schoggins et al., 2011). Notably, those results are generally consistent with this study, with five of seven ISGs re-identified in this study. However, in this study we identified many additional candidate anti-retroviral genes, a large number of which have not previously been reported to have antiretroviral activity. In general, our findings underscore the complexity of the interferon response with respect to inhibition of retroviral replication and suggest that the antiretroviral activity of type I IFN is mediated and regulated through the action of many ISGs (Table S5). Some ISGs appeared to act in a retrovirus-specific manner, while others had broad activity (Table S5). We also found some discrepancies in the antiretroviral activity between human and macaque variants of ISGs, which may contribute to the species-dependent barriers to retroviral replication that can be erected by type I IFN treatment (Bitzegeio et al., 2013). However, a caveat is that the screens were conducted in human cells, and it is possible that some ISGs may only function properly in cells of species from which they originate. Clearly, some of the genes identified herein act to enhance or modify signaling pathway rather than as directly antiviral proteins, while others appear to have direct antiviral activity. To characterize all of the candidate antiretroviral genes identified herein would take many years. Thus, we have focused on a small number of ISGs, as proof-of-principle of the usefulness of this strategy. Expression screens such as those reported herein are a powerful tool, but have weaknesses, including the potential for overexpression artifacts. However, we emphasize the fact that endogenous levels of two host factors we identify characterized herein can cause inhibition of retroviral replication. These two ISGs contribute to the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFNs via completely different mechanisms.",

The observation that exogenous L-Trp can relieve inhibition by IDO1 and IFN\u03b3 strongly suggests that IDO1 inhibits HIV-1 through L-Trp depletion rather than through the generation of catabolites such as kynurenine. Nutrient-depletion is a recognized anti-pathogen strategy and similar effects of IDO1 have been noted for other pathogens including measles virus and hepatitis B virus (Mao et al., 2011, Obojes et al., 2005). Indeed, SAMHD1, an IFN-inducible deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that is also active against HIV-1, acts by depleting essential substrates required for retrovirus replication (Goldstone et al., 2011).",

            "text": "A simple explanation for the effects of IDO1 is that L-Trp depletion could inhibit HIV-1 by limiting the availability of L-Trp for nascent viral protein synthesis. However, it is also true that T cells can actively respond to L-Trp depletion by activating GCN2 and mTOR signaling pathways (Cobbold et al., 2009, Munn et al., 2005), which could potentially impact viral gene expression. Importantly, it is plausible that L-Trp could be sufficiently depleted in T cells in vivo to exert an antiretroviral effect. IDO1 is expressed at very high levels in APCs in HIV-1-infected patients (Favre et al., 2010), and abundant IDO1 is observed in the lymph nodes of SIV-infected macaques (Estes et al., 2006). Efficient local depletion of L-Trp by APCs could therefore inhibit HIV-1 replication in neighboring CD4+ T cells. Notably, IDO1 is sufficiently active during chronic HIV-1 infection that serum L-Trp can be 50% lower than in healthy controls (reviewed in Murray, 2003). To impact serum L-Trp levels, extreme local depletion of L-Trp likely occurs in the microenvironments (i.e., lymphoid tissues) that support viral replication. Crucially, such local depletion of L-Trp is observed in vivo. GCN2 is activated by L-Trp depletion to levels around 20-fold lower than in normal serum and this IDO-dependent GCN2 activation is readily observed in vivo (Munn et al., 2005). Thus, tissue microenvironments likely experience L-Trp depletion to an extent that could suppress HIV-1 replication.",

IDO1 activity has been reported to skew CD4+ T cell differentiation to regulatory T cells at the expense of Th17 cells, thereby exacerbating CD4+ Th17 depletion, perhaps leading to increased microbial translocation and systemic immune activation (Brenchley et al., 2006, Favre et al., 2010).

            "text": "Our screens uncovered two antiretroviral TRIM proteins, TRIM38 and TRIM56, that appear to act by regulating the establishment of an antiviral state. Other TRIM proteins can stimulate cell responses to pathogens, including TRIM25, which induces ubiquitination of RIG-I (Gack et al., 2007), and TRIM5, which has been implicated in promoting inflammatory transcription (Pertel et al., 2011). Overexpression screens have suggested that other TRIM proteins have antiretroviral activity, through unknown mechanisms (Uchil et al., 2008). While overexpressed TRIM56 did not appear to function through IFN\u03b2 or ISRE promoter elements, endogenous TRIM56 both increased the expression of many ISGs in response to IFN\u03b1 and enhanced the establishment of an anti-HIV-1 state. Moreover, modest TRIM56 overexpression caused dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication. It is likely that these findings are causally related, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these reflect distinct activities of TRIM56, as the signaling and directly antiviral activities of tetherin and TRIM5 are clearly separable functions (Gal\u00e3o et al., 2012; Pertel et al., 2011). Previously, TRIM56 has been reported to inhibit the replication of several RNA viruses, while other RNA viruses are unaffected (Liu et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2011); it has also been reported to enhance cellular responsiveness to TLR3 signaling by binding to TRIF (Shen et al., 2012) and to enhance IFN\u03b2 production in response to dsDNA by binding to and ubiquitinating STING (Tsuchida et al., 2010). Our data are not consistent with an important role for STING-induced IFN expression as a key mediator of TRIM56 antiretroviral activity, because anti-HIV-1 activity of overexpressed TRIM56 was observed in cells that do not express STING and cGAS, and endogenous TRIM56 only exerted anti-HIV-1 activity and enhanced ISG expression following IFN\u03b1 treatment. STING-independent TRIM56 antiviral activity has also been reported for influenza viruses (Liu et al., 2016). Further work will be required to determine precisely how TRIM56 functions to inhibit HIV-1 replication and whether any previously described properties are relevant to its antiretroviral activity.",

            "text": "The consequences of ISG expression (such as nutrient depletion) are expected to have fitness costs for the host. However, if those costs are temporary, and smaller than those imposed by viral infection, then ISG expression is ultimately beneficial to the host. Thus, these data highlight the need for caution when contemplating therapeutic interventions designed to modulate the consequences of HIV-1 infection. Multiple ISGs that are associated with immune activation, illness, and disease progression during chronic infection likely also mediate suppression of HIV-1 replication. While the antiretroviral activities of ISGs are unable to tip the balance in favor of the host during natural HIV-1 infection, it is clear the IFNs can slow or ameliorate disease in HIV-1 and other retroviral infections. The findings reported herein should inform future efforts to understand the molecular basis by which IFNs shape susceptibility to retroviral infection, disease progression, cross-species transmission, and retroviral emergence.",
