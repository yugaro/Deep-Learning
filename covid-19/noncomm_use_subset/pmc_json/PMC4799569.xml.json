A significant improvement of MM treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and long-term survival rate was observed since the use of bortezomib and immunomodulators and the improvement in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[1] Bortezomib has significant anti-myeloma activity and manageable toxicity. The most common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and thrombocytopenia. It was demonstrated that bortezomib was significantly associated with high incidence of herpes zoster.[2] However, the effect of bortezomib on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains unclear. HBV reactivation was reported in a few cases after the treatment of bortezomib.[3456]",

Immunophenotypic analyses were performed in 269 patients using a four-color direct immunofluorescence staining to identify the immunophenotype of clonal plasma cell from erythrocyte-lysed bone marrow samples. The fluorescence was FITC/PE/PerCP-Cy5.5/APC, whereas the panel was CD38/CD56/CD9/CD45, CD45/CXCR4/CD117/CD38, CD38/CD138/CD45/CD19, CD38/CD45/cKappa/cLamda, CD38/CD45/CD20/CD28, and CD38/CD45/CD33/CD200. High risk cytogenetic abnormality was defined as at least abnormalities or 17p- by routine cytogenetic analysis. FISH was performed in interphase nuclei, which included 1q21 amplification, D13s319 (13q14.3) deletion, RB1 (13q14) deletion, P53 (17p13) deletion, and IgH (14q32) rearrangement. A minimum of 200 interphase cells were analyzed for each probe.

Bortezomib could inhibit the duplication of the fibroblast cell in vitro mouse study.[20] About 1 mg/kg of bortezomib could decrease copies of HBV in a transgenic mouse in vivo study.[21] The inhibition activity was disappeared when the concentration was below 0.2 mg/kg, however, when the concentration increased to 5 mg/kg, it did not further decrease; however, increase the copies of virus. Increased ALT levels in the higher dose group were seen on day 2 after bortezomib treatment and returned to normal on day 6, which indicated that the increase was not caused by virus replication. The opposite results were seen in mouse HBV infection in vivo model that 1 mg/kg of bortezomib treating C57BL/6 mice increased mouse HBV replication due to inhibition of immune cells.[22] The controversial results of the two studies might derive from the specific immune status of the transgenic mice. MM patients, whose immune functions are inhibited and are not immune-deficient, might be similar to the immune conditions of transgenic mice.",
