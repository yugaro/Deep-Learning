U16Rz was expressed in HeLa T4, where nucleolar specificity was observed. Upon HIV challenge, nucleolar U16Rz strongly suppressed HIV-1 production,22 selectively cleaving unspliced and partially spliced transcripts that traversed through the nucleolus to the sequestered ribozyme. Similarly, modified U16Rz targeting both U5 and gag (RzC36) significantly reduced viral production in CEM during HIV challenge.23",

We currently reveal that Rev nucleolar access is necessary for the completion of the HIV-1 infectious cycle. Nucleolar activity allows efficient HIV-1 mRNA splicing and nucleocytoplasmic transport. In the background of Rev nucleolar mutations, the frequency of viral integration increases dramatically in comparison to WT (wild type) HIV-1. Extreme integration frequencies result in cell death and the arrest of the HIV-1 infectious cycle. We further demonstrate the loss of Rev interaction with B23 as a result of nucleolar mutations, and discuss the involvement of B23 in other viral infectious models requiring nucleolar access for infectivity.",
