For collection of NS, the calf's nares were wiped clean with a single\u2010use paper towel. A 13\u2010cm polyester nasal swab3 then was inserted into the nostril to the full length of the swab, rubbed on the mucosa, and withdrawn. Next, the NPS sample was collected. The calf's nares again were wiped clean with a single\u2010use paper towel, and a 59\u2010cm guarded polyester swab4 was advanced to a depth approximately 2 cm rostral to the medial canthus of the eye. The swab was advanced approximately 4 cm farther, rotated, and withdrawn into the sheath before removal. One NS and 1 NPS were collected from each nostril. The samples collected from the left nostril were submitted for viral multiplex RT\u2010PCR, and the samples from the right nostril were submitted for bacterial culture. The swabs for viral RT\u2010PCR were placed in viral transport media (Eagle's minimal essential media with HEPES and sodium bicarbonate; gentamicin was added at 50 mg/mL and amphotericin B was added at 250 mg/mL and pH was adjusted to 7.0\u20137.3), and the swabs for bacterial culture were stored in Brucella broth with 10% glycerol; media were obtained from the Biological Media Services at the University of California, Davis. After the NS and NPS were collected and a TTW was obtained, a 6 \u00d7 6 cm area over the ventral trachea was clipped, subjected to sterile preparation of alternating scrubs with chlorhexidine scrub followed by 70% isopropanol, repeated 3 times, and locally blocked with 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. A commercially available TTW kit with a 15\u2010gauge cannula and a 48\u2010cm catheter5 was used for sample collection. After placement of the needle and catheter, 30 mL of sterile isotonic saline was instilled and withdrawn. A drop of the sample was removed from the retrieved volume of fluid with a plastic disposable serologic pipette for cytologic evaluation (cytology results to be reported elsewhere), and the remainder then was divided into equal aliquots for bacterial culture and viral RT\u2010PCR. After collection of the TTW, the BAL was obtained. The calf's nares again were wiped clean with a single\u2010use paper towel. A BAL tube6 was advanced through the nose until it wedged in a bronchus, and 100 mL of sterile isotonic saline was instilled and withdrawn. Retrieved fluid aliquots were pooled, and a drop of the sample was removed for cytologic evaluation (results to be reported elsewhere), and the remainder was divided into equal aliquots for bacterial culture and viral RT\u2010PCR. One aliquot was subjected to aerobic bacterial culture for identification of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and also Mycoplasma culture. Colonies identified as M. haemolytica were tested to confirm they were not Bibersteinia trehalosi or indole\u2010positive Mannheimia spp., which can appear to be similar to Mannheimia haemolytica. Any isolate with morphology consistent with Mycoplasma spp. was subjected to digitonin testing to differentiate Mycoplasma spp. from Acholeplasma spp.11 The second aliquot was subjected to viral multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR to identify the following viruses, with published primers and probes: BHV\u20101,12 bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2),7 BRSV,13 and bovine coronavirus (BCV).14 The samples were submitted to the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory in Tulare, California, for aerobic culture; the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory in Davis, California, for viral multiplex RT\u2010PCR; and the Milk Quality Laboratory in Tulare, California, for Mycoplasma culture and digitonin testing.",

The TTW was established as the reference standard for test comparison. Therefore, the pathogens detected by TTW for each calf were evaluated for agreement with the corresponding pathogen results for each of the other tests from the same calf: NS, NPS, and BAL. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the methods with respect to their marginal proportions of positive results, with significance set at P < .05. A sample size of 100 calves was used based on the availability of funding and a consideration of the power to detect a significant difference among methods with respect to the paired proportions of positive test results. It was determined that a sample size of 72 calves with a particular pathogen would provide a power of 80% to detect a difference of 15 percentage points in the proportions of positive test results, assuming a 5% type I error probability and discordant test results in 20% of the calves. Based on previous research by Lehenbauer et al. (personal communication), it was assumed that approximately 70% of the calves might be expected to have the most common pathogen; thus, a minimum enrollment of 100 calves was desired. The agreement among diagnostic tests then was evaluated by calculation of the kappa statistic and the percent positive agreement. Kappa values were interpreted to indicate strength of agreement as defined by Altman16: <0.20 = poor; 0.21\u20130.40 = fair; 0.41\u20130.6 = moderate; 0.61\u20130.80 = good, and 0.81\u20131.00 = very good. The percent positive agreement between 2 methods was calculated as 100 times the number of calves that were positive by both methods divided by the average number of calves that were positive by either method.17 Analyses were performed by commercially available statistical software.9\n",

For Mycoplasma spp., the percent positive agreement among sampling methods was high, but the kappa statistics were near zero. This outcome was attributable to the fact nearly all of the samples had a positive result by at least 1 of the methods, which resulted in a negatively biased kappa statistic, as has been discussed (Cunningham. \u201cMore than just the kappa coefficient: a program to fully characterize inter\u2010rater reliability between two raters.\u201d SAS Global Forum 2009, Paper 242\u20102009, http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/242-2009.pdf).

The sampling methods evaluated in our study are commonly used, and each method has advantages and disadvantages. The results presented here add new information to the body of knowledge regarding the comparative value of these antemortem sampling techniques. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have compared the results of all 4 of these methods, although previous studies have compared NS or NPS to lower airway sampling.6, 8, 9 The results of our study suggest that NS, NPS, or BAL are all similar in their ability to determine when M. haemolytica, P. multocida, or M. bovis are present in the lower airways of dairy calves with acute BRD, as identified by TTW. In contrast, for the viral agents identified in this study, agreement (as measured by percent positive agreement and also by the kappa statistic) was stronger for BAL and TTW than for NS or NPS and TTW. Moreover, for BCV, the significant McNemar's test indicated that the positive test proportions for NS and NPS could not be considered comparable to the less common TTW results. Future work is warranted to determine whether the relative agreement among these diagnostic tests is the same for other classes of cattle with BRD, such as feedlot cattle or stocker cattle.",

One study compared the bacteria isolated from guarded NPS to those isolated from postmortem lung lavage in 4\u2010 to 6\u2010month\u2010old beef calves with naturally occurring acute BRD.6 With samples from 20 animals, these investigators found that identification of these pathogens by NPS was a reliable way to predict that they also would be present in lung lavage. Another study compared results of bacterial culture to identify M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni from guarded NPS to results of culture of samples collected by \u201cguarded transtracheal swab.\u201d9 These investigators found that when both samples were positive on bacterial culture, the same organism was present 96% of the time. Similar to previous findings,6 when the 2 samples were not in agreement, it was more common for the NPS to be negative when the lower airway sample was positive than vice versa. Another study evaluated the bacterial pathogens isolated from guarded NPS and BAL by endoscopy in 59 feedlot cattle with signs of acute BRD and 60 matched control cattle.8 Using data from both cases and controls, these investigators found that kappa ranged from 0.47\u20130.61 for M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and M. bovis. They concluded that NPS accurately represented the results of lower airway culture at the group level but not at the level of the individual animal.

In contrast, for BCV, the NS and NPS both yielded significantly higher proportions of positive results compared with TTW.
