            "text": "Pathogen reduction (PR) of platelet (PLT) concentrates using a psoralen as the photoactivating agent is a relatively new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved technology that has been deemed suitable by the Agency for all patient demographics.1, 2 The manufacturing process features the addition of a synthetic psoralen compound, amotosalen, to single\u2010donor apheresis PLT concentrates, which are then exposed to ultraviolet (UV)\u2010A illumination. Psoralens are natural compounds that are found in a number of foods and plants. Forms of psoralens have been used in a variety of other therapies including photopheresis.3 Amotosalen intercalates into DNA and RNA and, once activated by UV\u2010A light, produces an irreversible inter\u2010 and intrachain cross\u2010linking of nucleic acids.4 This cross\u2010linking prevents replication of nucleic acids and, in turn, the pathogen. Since intact nucleic acid activity is not needed for PLTs to function, this approach is believed to diminish the infectious risk posed by a wide variety of pathogens without damaging the hemostatic efficacy of the PLTs. Free photoproducts created by the illumination of amotosalen in this process are adsorbed by a compound adsorption device, minimizing the amount of amotosalen and its byproducts that could be transfused to the patient.3, 4, 5, 6 Any amotosalen that the patient does receive is cleared quickly, with excretion being primarily via the fecal route.5, 6 The half\u2010life of amotosalen is approximately 6.5 hours, and studies have shown that the peak amotosalen level post\u2010PR PLT transfusion is approximately 900 pg/mL.3, 5, 7 While bacterial contamination remains of primary concern, PR is effective against a wide variety of organisms ranging from viruses to protozoa to bacteria, including those most commonly responsible for PLT contamination. Some pathogens, however, such as hepatitis A, hepatitis E, parvovirus B19, poliovirus, and prions, the agent of variant Creutzfeldt\u2010Jacob Disease (vCJD), are resistant to the treatment.2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 PLT contamination with these latter organisms, however, is uncommon. In addition, due to the intercalation of amotosalen into white blood cell nucleic acid chains, the PR process also prevents T\u2010cell proliferation, and thus it is effective for the prevention of transfusion\u2010associated graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease (TA\u2010GVHD), eliminating the need for gamma or X\u2010ray irradiation of these PLTs.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Psoralen\u2010based PR techniques have been utilized in Europe for many years, and multiple published studies support the benefits and safety of PR products.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Phase III clinical trials are also ongoing for riboflavin (MIPLATE) and UV\u2010C light\u2013based PR techniques for PLTs (CAPTURE).4, 25, 26 PR systems are also currently available for plasma and cryoprecipitate. Systems for PR red blood cells are in Phase III clinical trials.25, 26, 27, 28, 29\n",

As a result of the growth of our facility and the increasing acuity of our patients, PLT usage has increased over the past several years from approximately 7500 units to more than 10,000 units per year. An increase in volume and acuity has led to an increase in pathogen\u2010associated PLT transfusion cases. In one incident, a blood bank technologist identified a unit of PLTs with obvious PLT clumping during the sign\u2010out process. As the technologist was aware that this could be indicative of a contaminated product, the unit was quarantined. This unit was one of a non\u2010PR triple\u2010apheresis collection and on testing in the microbiology laboratory was shown to be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. That unit and the other two contaminated single\u2010donor PLT (SDP) cocomponents were interdicted and, fortunately, never reached a patient. The occurrence of this and several other clinical events involving bacterially contaminated PLT units at our institution raised serious concerns regarding our organization's ability to fully protect patients from transfusion\u2010transmitted infections. Many of our patients are severely immunosuppressed and vulnerable to life\u2010threatening blood\u2010borne infections. Such occurrences substantially increased the institutional desire to seek the safest possible PLT products.",

            "text": "Once our transfusion medicine service reached an internal consensus to integrate PR PLTs into our inventory, we approached our department's chairman for his support and agreement (Fig. 1). This is an important step, since such a discussion should be held within the department before it is brought to outside administrative areas and service lines. The next approval was sought from the hospital's transfusion committee. Once that committee agreed and we had their administrative support to move the project forward, we contacted the institution's chief medical officer with our plan. Our guiding philosophy, presented to all levels of the administration, was that patient safety was paramount. Concurrence at the C\u2010suite level was an essential early step, as the increased cost of PR PLTs, compared to that of conventional (non\u2010PR) PLTs, was substantial. The chief medical officer agreed with the safety\u2010over\u2010cost concept and facilitated communication with other hospitals in our health system. Approval from other members of the health system reinforced the importance and timeliness of our goal and the necessity of efforts to foster safer transfusion therapy. It is also worth noting that uniform policies and practices are increasingly being sought among all our health system's member hospitals. We then proceeded to communicate the upcoming policy change to multiple stakeholder groups and service lines (Fig. 1). Our hypothesis was that the more people we included in the decision process, and the sooner we informed them of the plan, the smoother the transition would be once we launched the PR PLT program. Within the Department of Laboratory Medicine, our blood bank manager and the transfusion safety and compliance officers were key figures assisting with early notification and consultation across multiple service lines (Fig. 1).",

The risk management and ethics committees were approached due to both the medicolegal and the ethical implications of managing a dual PLT inventory while we converted our stock from conventional to PR PLTs. Such a shift in transfusion practice has implications regarding standard of care, which are discussed further in the next section. In addition, we consulted our department business office and hospital finance department to develop a business plan that would provide the key financial data needed to inform the decision to migrate the PLT inventory to a safer, albeit more expensive, product. It is critically important not to underestimate the value of a well\u2010thought\u2010out and well\u2010prepared business plan when addressing senior administration. Such a plan not only provides necessary fiscal data, but it also conveys the message to the hospital administration that the blood bank director understands the impact that such a move has on the financial health of the institution.

The blood bank similarly needed to have the appropriate codes added to the laboratory information system.

Extensive discussions were held with our blood suppliers regarding the inventory shift and their ability to meet our anticipated needs (Fig. 1). Such discussions were critical to allow planning at our hospital. As mentioned, frank conversations with our primary blood supplier disclosed that they would not be able to commit to meeting 100% of our demand for PR PLTs for at least 1 to 2 years after we decided to restructure our inventory. At that time, this was due to a lack of sufficient manufacturing infrastructure, a paucity of trained personnel, an uncertain supply of PLT donors with high enough PLT counts, difficulty in meeting the requisite manufacturing \u201cguard bands,\u201d and the lack of a biologics license application (BLA) to allow interstate shipping of PLTs from out\u2010of\u2010state manufacturing sites.30 Without a BLA, interstate shipment of even FDA\u2010approved biologics is generally prohibited. Moreover, seasonal and holiday PLT shortages were certain to further infringe on our ability to obtain PR PLTs. When all these factors were considered, it became evident to us that a dual PLT inventory was unavoidable.31 Even when our secondary blood supplier (in a neighboring state) received their BLA 18 months into our program, a sufficient number of PR PLTs to meet 100% of our demand still could not be obtained (Fig. 2).",

With administrative, legal, and regulatory approval (and with concurrence from the transfusion committee) we chose to consider conventional PLTs, including those on Storage Day 5 that were tested with the PGD assay and PR PLTs at any storage time, to be the standard of care at our institution. Accordingly, this eliminated the need to determine whether a patient received a PR or conventional PLT product treated with a safety measure, both of which are FDA\u2010approved products. As mentioned, both were considered to be \u201cstandard of care\u201d by our hospital's ethics and risk management committees. No patients were assigned to receive one product over another. Thus, after receipt of a request for PLTs, either a PR unit or a conventional non\u2010PR unit (the latter tested with the PGD assay if stored for 5 days before distribution), would be issued by the blood bank staff as equivalent products without concern for patient acuity or demographics. This added safety measure test was initially instituted only for Day 5 conventional PLTs in our inventory. During the conversion process, while we were maintaining a dual inventory, a septic reaction to Day 4 conventional PLTs occurred. Since we only tested conventional PLTs on Day 5 of storage and the contaminated units were at Day 4 of storage, they were not tested. After this incident, we thus changed our policy to include safety measure testing of Day 4 as well as Day 5 conventional products.2, 30\n",

One such group included neonates, as there was an early and ongoing concern that even minimal residual psoralen in PR PLTs could be harmful to these patients.42 This concern was especially applicable to those newborns undergoing phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, and our neonatologists also had some reservations in this regard, despite FDA clearance of PR PLTs for all patient groups.1, 7 A review of neonates receiving both PR PLTs and blue light phototherapy at our institution, however, showed no evidence of rash, toxicity, or adverse effects.37 This was not unexpected since the synthetic psoralen used in the PR process absorbs light in the 320\u2010 to 375\u2010nm wavelength range, while phototherapy devices in use in the Western World typically emit light in the 400\u2010 to 520\u2010nm wavelength range.43 Older pediatric and obstetric patients were also populations of interest. Again, we and others have observed no difference in the rate of adverse transfusion events or in PLT utilization for patients receiving PR PLTs compared to conventional PLTs in these groups.33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44 Although the small sample size precludes generalization, no cases of TA\u2010GVHD were identified among any of our autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients who received PR PLT transfusions that were not irradiated.39 Similar findings regarding the lack of reports of TA\u2010GVHD in comparable recipients of nonirradiated PR PLTs have been published.34, 35, 36 Among adult nonpregnant patients, no increase in transfusion reactions or PLT usage was seen in patients given PR PLTs compared to those receiving conventional PLT products.38, 39 These data findings were communicated to our hospital service line medical personnel.",

Shifting our PLT inventory to PR products required an increased expenditure of 50% above the cost of conventional PLT products. Of this increase, half was attributed to requiring a change to SDPs from pooled random PLT donor units (pooled units are not approved for use with PR treatment) and the other half from the cost of the PR process itself. Blood banks are cost centers, not revenue centers. As they do not generate revenue, there are very few ways to shift costs and save money when implementing PR PLTs. Other seemingly less expensive options, however, such as those aimed at mitigating bacterial contamination risk alone, may be as expensive as PR when space, equipment, training, and staffing requirements are considered.32, 45, 46, 47\n",

The financial impact of paying for additional assays as new nonbacterial pathogens inevitably appear may prove to be substantial. PR treatment of PLTs, we believe, thus presents an efficient and, in the long run, cost\u2010effective method by which to mitigate the risk of bacterial and nonbacterial pathogens.45, 46, 47\n",

Clear communication throughout the institution, from nursing units to the C\u2010suite, is vital. Training and education across service lines promotes a smooth transition, as does strong involvement of blood bank leadership throughout the \u201cgo live\u201d process. A plan for maintaining and managing a dual inventory is critically important, and continued hemovigilance monitoring of PR PLTs after the rollout ensures a high level of transfusion safety and efficacy. We recommend that hospital financial personnel be involved in the process in the early planning stages. Similarly, involvement by IT must not be overlooked, as problems with the EMR ordering and scanning programs are a major source of clinician end\u2010user dissatisfaction. PR PLTs are more expensive than conventional PLTs. We believe, however, that conversion to a full PR PLT inventory is prudent, cost\u2010effective, and foresightful and appropriately prioritizes patient safety.",
