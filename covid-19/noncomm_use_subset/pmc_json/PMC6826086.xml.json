Recently, several well-designed clinical trials, including those evaluating TICH-2, have been planned and conducted, but they have not shown statistically satisfactory results including reduce hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes.2233) Therefore, our study investigated the effect of tranexamic acid on ICH in a way similar to Sorimachi's study.27) Our results showed that there was no statistical significance in ICH patients with rapid administration of tranexamic acid and strict conservative management, but the rate of patients who experienced hematoma expansion was reduced (14.5% vs. 10.7%).",
