Annual epidemics result in a high number of hospitalizations, with an estimated 3\u20135 million cases of severe disease and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally, and higher mortality rates are possible during pandemics (Wright et al., 2007).

However, influenza A infections account for the majority of hospitalizations and are the only type to cause pandemics (Wright et al., 2007). Influenza A is subtyped by its two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is the main target of neutralizing antibodies that are induced by infection or vaccination. The globular HA head domain mediates binding to the sialic acid receptor, while the HA stem mediates the subsequent fusion between the viral and cellular membranes that is triggered in endosomes by the low pH (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). Genetically, there are 16 influenza A subtypes of HA, which form two structurally and antigenically distinct groups (Nobusawa et al., 1991, Russell et al., 2004). In addition, two new HA analogs recovered from bats, H17 and H18, have been included in this classification (Tong et al., 2012, Tong et al., 2013). Currently, H1 and H3 HA subtypes are associated with human disease and viruses containing H5, H7, H9, and H10 HAs are associated with sporadic human infections due to direct transmission from avian species.",

Anti-stem antibodies are less potent at direct viral neutralization as compared to anti-head antibodies, but were shown to induce potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of infected cells in vitro and in vivo (Corti et al., 2011, Dilillo et al., 2016, DiLillo et al., 2014), while anti-head antibodies were not or less effective at mediating ADCC. In general, the human antibody response to the HA stem region is more frequent against group 1 as compared to group 2 HAs and is dominated by VH1-69 antibodies (Pappas et al., 2014, Sui et al., 2009, Wrammert et al., 2011). Although subdominant, the group 1 stem response was shown to be recalled after heterologous boosts by the new pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009 (Corti et al., 2011, Wrammert et al., 2011). The antibody response to the HA stem region of group 2 HAs is less frequent, possibly due to the presence of a conserved glycan bound to N38 in HA1 that may shield the access to the most conserved sites in the HA stem and to the lack of exposure to heterologous group 2 viruses (i.e., H7) or to new pandemic H3N2 viruses. Finally, antibodies capable of reacting with the HA stem region of both group 1 and 2 subtypes are extremely rare and usually do not show complete coverage of all subtypes. It has been hypothesized that such broadly cross-reactive antibodies might have potential as therapeutic agents and studies on their mechanism of action, epitope specificity, and ontogeny could also inform the design of cross-protective influenza virus vaccines (Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013, Yewdell, 2013).",

In view of the limitations of group 1 and group 2 antibodies isolated so far, we searched for an antibody capable of potently neutralizing group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses within a narrow range of antibody concentrations. In this study, we isolated and optimized an antibody, named MEDI8852, that exhibited unprecedented breadth and potency, being able to neutralize a diverse panel of representative viruses spanning >80 years of antigenic evolution. Unlike other broadly neutralizing stem-reactive antibodies, MEDI8852 is unique in that it uses a rare VH (VH6-1) and carries a low level of somatic mutations. Crystallographic analysis of the Fab alone or in complex with H5 and H7 HA proteins reveals that MEDI8852 binds a highly conserved epitope on H5 and H7 that is markedly different from other structurally characterized stem-reactive neutralizing antibodies. The characterization of this unique epitope and the breadth and potency of neutralization exhibited by MEDI8852 support its development for immunotherapy in influenza virus-infected humans.",

These antibodies (FY1, FY5, FY6, and FY18) belong to the same lineage carrying VH6-1\u221701/D3-3\u221701/JH3\u221702 and VK1-39\u221701/JK1\u221701 gene segments (Figure 1A). We reconstructed the genealogical trees of this lineage and produced the unmutated common ancestor (UCA), the four clonally derived antibodies, and three antibodies representing the evolutionary branching points (BP) of the lineage (Figure 1B). Purified antibodies were tested for neutralizing activity against multiple viruses of different group 1 and 2 subtypes (Figure 1C). Interestingly, the UCA antibody exhibited neutralizing activity against group 1 viruses, but not group 2 viruses, albeit with lower potency as compared to some of the mutated antibodies. Of note, the first BP (BP1) gained neutralization activity toward early group 2 H3N2 viruses (HK/68 and VC/75). Two antibodies (i.e., FY1 and FY5) of this lineage acquired neutralization activity against group 2 viruses through two independent pathways of somatic mutations. The same analysis was extended to the lineage of FI6, a previously described antibody cross-neutralizing group 1 and group 2 viruses (Corti et al., 2011). Isolation of five additional antibodies from this lineage allowed the reconstruction of a complex genealogy tree (Figure S1). Similarly to what was observed for the FY1 lineage, the FI6-UCA antibody exhibited neutralizing activity against group 1 viruses only and evolved through two independent pathways of somatic mutations that led to the group 1-specific FI370 and FI6038 antibodies and to the group 1 and 2 cross-reactive antibodies FI6, FI2013 and FI4013. Taken together, these findings suggest that in both lineages, the UCA was initially selected by a group 1 virus and developed to a branching point characterized by cross-reactivity toward a limited number of group 2 viruses. From this point, the final antibody may have been selected further for binding to group 1 only (e.g., FY6 and FI370) or group 2 HAs (e.g., FY1 and FI6). These results are consistent with a model in which the development of cross-reactive group 1 and 2 antibodies is started by group 1 HAs and then further selected through boosts by group 2 HAs.",

The resulting antibody was named MEDI8852 (VH and VL sequences shown in Figure 1A) and was compared side by side with the parental FY1 antibody for binding and neutralization of a large panel of influenza A viruses. MEDI8852 showed higher binding activity as compared to FY1 against the group 1 HA proteins of H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9 subtypes and group 2 HA proteins of H3 and H7 subtypes, with a mean half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.064 \u03bcg/ml versus 0.124 \u03bcg/ml for MEDI8852 and FY1, respectively (Figure 2B; Table S2).

All seasonal influenza viruses tested were neutralized by FY1 and MEDI8852 with median IC50 values of 1.33 \u03bcg/ml and 0.51 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, resulting in nearly a 3-fold increase in overall potency (Figure 2D).

The increase in overall activity of MEDI8852 compared to FY1 was also apparent when tested against 13 non-seasonal influenza viruses including H5 and H7 viruses isolated from recent human infections. MEDI8852 neutralized these viruses having an overall median IC50 of 1.21 \u03bcg/ml (range 4.05\u20130.41 \u03bcg/ml) versus FY1 with a median IC50 of 3.59 \u03bcg/ml (range 11.05\u20130.76 \u03bcg/ml) (Figure 2E).

As reported previously, these antibodies neutralized group 1 and group 2 viruses although they exhibited distinct differences in both potency and breadth. Among all the antibodies tested, MEDI8852 is the only one that demonstrated neutralizing activity against all the viruses tested with a median IC50 0.99 \u03bcg/ml (range 8.75\u20130.09 \u03bcg/ml). CR9114 failed to neutralize the human H2N2 A/Japan/57 virus. Both FI6v3 and 39.29 were unable to neutralize the contemporary human isolate H7N9 A/Anhui/2013, and 39.29 was incapable of neutralizing the A/Netherlands/2003 H7N7 virus, both H9N2 viruses, and a contemporary H3N2 virus, A/Palau/2014, at the highest concentration tested (50 \u03bcg/ml). In addition to better overall breadth of neutralization, MEDI8852 exhibits equal or greater neutralization potency than the other cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies with a median IC50 of 0.99 \u03bcg/ml, compared to 2.13, 7.57, and 1.76 \u03bcg/ml for CR9114, 39.29, and FI6v3, respectively, when the non-neutralized viruses are excluded from the analysis.",

In these studies, ferrets were infected intranasally with 1 LD90 of VT/2004 and then treated with a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 25 mg/kg of MEDI8852 at 1, 2, or 3 days post infection.

In comparison, ferrets treated with MEDI8852 or oseltamivir on day 1 post infection were completely protected.

The structures of the HA proteins in both complexes are similar to those of the apo structures determined before (Russell et al., 2004, Xiong et al., 2015). MEDI8852 makes similar contacts with both H5 and H7 HAs, by binding in a very similar orientation to both HAs (Figures 5B\u20135D), each Fab interacting with just one protomer of the HA trimer. Overall, the interactions bury 1,750 and 1,646 \u00c52 from solvent for the H5 and H7 complexes, respectively, consistent with their high binding affinity (Table S2). MEDI8852 contacts the fusion domain of HA and interacts with three regions of HA2, a central hydrophobic groove, the fusion peptide and helix A, and with specific residues in the HA1 component of the fusion domain (Figure 6). The location of MEDI8852 in the complex with the HA proteins is consistent with the in vitro assays showing that MEDI8852 stabilized the pre-fusion conformation inhibiting fusion as well as blocking the proteolytic cleavage of the HA precursor on the neighboring subunit (Figure 3).",

We can, therefore, have confidence in our description of the inter-molecular contacts: hydrogen bonds described in the text should be regarded as potential interactions, however, given the limitations of defining the exact geometry of these interactions. The principal contact areas involve three CDRs, CDRH3, CDRH2, and CDRL1, with minor interactions with CDRH1 and CDRL3 (Figure 6A). CDRH3 makes extensive contacts with the bottom of a hydrophobic groove between helix A of HA2 and the fusion domain component of HA1 (Figures 6B and 6C). Phe100A(CDRH3) inserts into this groove made by HA2 residues Ile45, Val48, Thr49, and Val52 of helix A, Trp21 of the fusion peptide, and Thr309 of HA1. Val100C(CDRH3) binds in a lower position in the same groove and interacts with the main chain of HA2 residues 19\u201321 of the fusion peptide as well as with the side chains of Trp21 and of HA1 His8 (Figure 6B). Asn100D(CDRH3) also makes hydrophobic contact with Val18 in the fusion peptide (Figure 6C). The CDRH2 loop interacts, through VH germline-encoded residues, with HA2 residues 15\u201319 of the fusion peptide (Figure 6C). In particular, HA2 Val18 is almost completely protected from solvent by Tyr56(CDRH2) and Arg52B(CDRH2). There is also van der Waals interaction between the C\u03b1 of HA2 Gly16 and Tyr52(CDRH2). Tyr52(CDRH2) is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of Gly16. Arg50(CDRH2) forms a salt bridge with HA2 Asp19. Arg50(CDRH2) also contributes to a polar patch on the antibody surface that includes Arg96(CDRL3) and Asp58(CDRH2) and Asp100F(CDRH3). Finally, CDRL1 interacts with the N-terminal region of helix A of HA2 (Figure 6D). Ser30(CDRL1) and Ser31(CDRL1) are in hydrogen bonding distance of HA2 Gln42, while Tyr32(CDRL1) and Leu29(CDRL1) make hydrophobic contacts with the aliphatic moiety of HA2 Lys38 of helix A. The side chain of Tyr32(CDRL1) stacks against HA2 Gln42 of helix A and its hydroxyl group is in hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain of HA2 Asp19 of the fusion peptide.",

However, the membrane proximal fusion domains of both group 1 and group 2 HAs have a few distinct structural differences such as glycosylation status of HA1 position 38, which could potentially affect the binding of some antibodies (Corti et al., 2011, Ekiert et al., 2009, Sui et al., 2009). In the H7 complex with MEDI8852, the bulky carbohydrate chain attached to HA1 Asn38 changes its orientation to allow antibody binding, as observed before in the FI6 Fab-H3 HA complex (Corti et al., 2011). Another notable feature of the MEDI8852 complex with H7 HA is the involvement of HA2 Tyr38 in an aromatic stacking interaction with Tyr32(CDRL1). Interestingly, the tyrosine at position 38 is not conserved across all HA subtypes only in H7, H10, and H15. The arginine in H6, H9, H11, and H12 could engage in a similar stacking interaction although the leucine, lysine, and glutamine found in the remaining HA proteins could not interact in the same way. Thus, the high and similar affinities with which MEDI8852 reacts with these HAs, suggests that the differences in glycosylation at HA1 38 and the side chain at HA2 38 make a minor contribution to the overall energetics of binding (Figure 2B; Table S2).",

In contrast, the group 2-neutralizing antibodies CR8020 and CR8043 (Ekiert et al., 2011, Friesen et al., 2014) recognize a different region of the fusion peptide and a small \u03b2 sheet below it in the fusion domain (Figure 7B, red box). The epitope of MEDI8852, uniquely among the cross-group neutralizing antibodies reported to date, represents a combination of both regions. A structural comparison of HA-bound MEDI8852 overlapped with the antibodies CR8020 and CR9114 is shown in Figures S7A and S7B, which reveals that the overall orientation of MEDI8852 is such that it sits slightly higher on the HA than the CR8020 antibody and lower than CR9114.

However, other contacts made by these antibodies with HA are quite different between MEDI8852 and 39.29, reflecting the fact that the two antibodies are not particularly similar in sequence and are derived from different germline sequences (VH6-1\u221701 and VK 1-39\u221701 for MEDI8852 versus VH3-30\u221701 and VK3-15\u221701 for 39.29).

The cross-group binding of FI6v3 has been attributed to its long and flexible HCDR3, which can accommodate the differences in conformation and environment of HA2 Trp21 observed between group 1 and group 2 viruses. There is a much more significant rearrangement between FI6v3 bound to H1 HA (group 1) versus H3 HA (group 2) than there is between MEDI8852 in its complexes with H5 HA (group 1) and H7 HA (group 2) which overlap very closely (Figures 5B and S7C).

Among the antibodies considered to date, the anti-HA human monoclonal antibody MEDI8852 has demonstrated significant breadth of its infectivity-neutralizing capacity. MEDI8852 reacts with HAs of all influenza antigenic subtypes, potently neutralizes diverse virus strains with numerous HA subtypes, and can block infection and lethality caused by influenza viruses when administered up to 4 days after challenge with the virus in mice and up to 3 days post challenge in ferrets with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. This potential ability to overcome the unpredictable characteristics of influenza, namely the antigenic shift, that results in disease during pandemic periods, and the antigenic drift, that occurs with the emergence of antigenically novel viruses, is a major advantage for a candidate anti-influenza therapeutic antibody.",

            "text": "The mechanisms of MEDI8852-mediated neutralization of infection involve processes at the beginning and the end of the infection cycle. Binding of the antibody to HAs on the infecting virus inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion that is required for the initiation of infection. At the end of infection, antibody binding to precursor HA0 can block its cleavage and prevent the formation and spread of newly made infectious virus. Additionally, binding of MEDI8852 to HAs displayed on the surfaces of infected cells results in their recognition and lysis by other components of the immune system: NK cells, macrophages, and complement. These multiple mechanisms exhibited by MEDI8852 presumably combine to ensure the observed effectiveness of antibody treatments in infected mice and ferrets.",

However, the regions of HA that interact with MEDI8852 are a combination of those previously assigned to group 1 specificity (primarily a hydrophobic groove and the adjacent helix A of HA) (Ekiert et al., 2009, Sui et al., 2009) or group 2 specificity (a separate part of the fusion peptide, near its N terminus) (Ekiert et al., 2011, Friesen et al., 2014). The structural characterization of MEDI8852 bound and unbound structures also highlight the coordinated movement of the CDRH3 and the CDRL1 to insert into the hydrophobic grove of the HA, as well as the rearrangement of the orientation of the glycan attached to Asn38 of the H7 virus to allow antibody binding. Importantly, structures of the complexes formed by MEDI8852 with H5 and H7 HAs indicate that the locations and orientations of the bound antibodies are very similar, and this structurally conserved ability to interact with both regions of HA presumably results in effective cross-reactivity.",

Indeed, the MEDI8852 donor was born in the 1950s and it is possible that this lineage was primed by H2N2 and further matured through multiple H3N2 exposures. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that the UCA mAb neutralized with high potency the strain H2N2 JP/57 (i.e., IC50 = 0.6 \u03bcg/ml). The UCA and mutated antibodies of the MEDI8852 and FI6 lineages represent useful tools to design stem-based immunogens that can be used in a heterologous prime-boost mode to prime the group 1 reactive naive B cells and selectively expand those that also cross-react with group 2 HAs.",

G54 (MEDI8852) instead of K54 (parental): This amino acid is located in the middle of the CDRH2 loop in an unusual turn between the two beta strands of CDRH2. The backbone at G54 adopts a conformation that is only possible with a glycine sidechain. The parental K54 would lead to a different backbone conformation. Light chain: T33 (MEDI8852) instead of L33 (parental): This residue is next to CDRL1 and especially Y32, which undergo a conformational change upon binding. The T33 sidechain stacks against the sidechain of F71 in unbound and bound conformations, anchoring the entire CDRL1 region during the conformational change. The leucine in the parental antibody could make a similar stacking interaction, but would anchor CDRL1 in a different conformation due to the additional methyl group of the leucine. R54 and G55 instead of L54 and Q55 (parental): R54 and G55 are in CDRL2 and connected with CDRL1 through backbone hydrogen bonds. The sidechain of Q55 in the parental antibody would sterically clash with L46 and completely alter the backbone and sidechain conformation the LCDR1 and LCDR2 loops. G55 has no sidechain and thus does not clash. Therefore, R54 and G55 enable and stablilize the backbone conformation observed in the complex, which might form a stable platform for the conformational change in CDRL1 necessary for binding.",
