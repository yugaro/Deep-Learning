Indeed, some cellular restriction factors of lentiviral vectors may not be present in mice, but can limit gene transfer to pigs or humans. For example, murine cells do not express a restricting TRIM5\u03b1 and are permissive to both HIV and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).17 Similar to primate variants of TRIM5\u03b1, ungulate variants can restrict retroviral transduction.18,19 The predicted protein sequence of porcine TRIM5\u03b1 is phylogenetically close to the broadly restrictive bovine TRIM5\u03b1 protein,18 suggesting that porcine TRIM5\u03b1 may also be broadly restrictive. For gene therapy to be successful, there is a need to match the optimal choice of viral vector to the appropriate preclinical model.",

Porcine cells are not widely used for lentiviral gene transfer studies and little effort has been put forth optimizing or comparing viral vector transduction efficacy in this animal model. We generated matched vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG)-pseudotyped FIV and HIV-based vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Figure 1a). In addition, these self-inactivating vectors contain the wPRE and cPPT elements.22 Murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) are subtyped as N-tropic (N-MLV) or B-tropic (B-MLV) according to their infectivity in certain strains of mice. Importantly, N-MLV infection is consistently restricted by Trim5\u03b1 from mammalian species whereas B-MLV is resistant to the Trim5\u03b1 restriction.18,23 As such, N-MLV and B-MLV vectors expressing GFP serve as controls for Trim5\u03b1 restriction. We transduced human cervical (HeLa), bovine kidney (MDBK), and porcine kidney epithelia cells (PK1) with FIV, HIV, N-MLV, and B-MLV at multiplicity of infection (MOIs) ranging from 0.5 to 5 (Figure 1b). FIV- and HIV-based vectors transduced HeLa cells with similar efficacy and, consistent with previous observations,18 both had restricted expression in MDBK cells. Interestingly, FIV transduced PK1 cells approximately tenfold better than HIV across all MOIs tested. No restriction of FIV was apparent in PK1 cells compared with B-MLV, which typically displayed higher levels of transduction in most cell types tested, including airway cell lines (data not shown) and HeLa cells (Figure 1b). We next contrasted the lentiviral transduction patterns in well-differentiated primary cultures of porcine airway epithelia (PAE). PAEs derived from wild-type pig trachea were transduced with N-MLV, B-MLV, FIV, or HIV-1 at MOIs of 5 or 20 (Figure 1b). Consistent with PK1 cells, we observed greater transduction efficacy of FIV as compared with HIV. We next compared the transduction efficiency of FIV and HIV in four different immortalized cell lines derived from human lung epithelia. While higher level of transduction was seen with FIV compared to HIV in H441 cells, similar transduction efficiencies with FIV or HIV were observed in the rest of the cell lines (Figure 1c). Transduction pattern differences of FIV and HIV-1 in porcine cells, but not in human-derived cells, suggests the existence of species-specific restriction factors against HIV-1 in porcine cells.",

Bovine TRIM5 was previously demonstrated to have broad restrictive properties against many lentiviruses including HIV-1 and FIV.18,19,24 We hypothesized that porcine TRIM5 could restrict both FIV and HIV vectors because of its close phylogenetic similarity to bovine TRIM5. Using porcine-specific primers, porcine TRIM5\u03b1 mRNA was successfully amplified from PK1 and PAE cells (Figure 2a). A hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged porcine TRIM5\u03b1 was transiently transfected into HT1080 cell lines and expression was confirmed by western blot (Figure 2b). Cells transfected with empty plasmid or porcine TRIM5\u03b1 were transduced with N-MLV, B-MLV, FIV, or HIV-1 at MOIs of 5. B-MLV transduction was not restricted in the presence of porcine TRIM5, as expected (Figure 2c). While restriction of N-MLV was observed in porcine TRIM5-expressing cells, no restriction was observed for FIV or HIV transduction.",

This chimera contains the residues responsible for capsid specificity.26 MDTF cells expressing no TRIM5\u03b1 serve as the baseline. All TRIM5\u03b1 proteins were HA-tagged and cell lines confirmed by immunoblotting to express equivalent protein levels (Figure 2f). Cells were transduced with GFP expressing N-MLV, B-MLV, or FIV pseudotyped with VSVG. As expected, no significant restriction of B-MLV was observed; however, N-MLV virus was restricted by TRIM5\u03b1 expressed from each of the tested MDTF cell lines (Figure 2g). Following transduction with FIV, restriction was seen in cells expressing TRIM5\u03b1 from both nonhuman primate species tested (Figure 2g). Human TRIM5\u03b1 did not restrict FIV; whereas, TRIM5\u03b1hu(rh325-344) restricted expression to levels similar to TRIM5\u03b1rh. These data suggest that based on TRIM5\u03b1 restriction patterns, pigs may be better suited to FIV-based preclinical studies than nonhuman primates.",

For initial pilot experiments, we delivered vector to the nasal epithelia of mice. After septa from mice were collected and the epithelial cells were cultured, mCherry expression was readily observed (Figure 6a). The epithelial cells were allowed to fully differentiate at an air-liquid interface for 4 weeks before lysates were collected for FACS analysis. Based on FACS analysis, 5.5 \u00b1 0.3% of culture mouse septa were mCherry positive. Encouraged by these results, we repeated the process in the pig ethmoid sinus. As before, the epithelial cells were allowed to fully differentiate at an air-liquid interface for 4 weeks. Again, mCherry expression was readily observed in cultured left ethmoid sinus epithelia (Figure 6b) but not the contralateral untransduced ethmoid sinus (Figure 6c).

This unexpected finding led us to investigate the transduction efficiency of FIV and HIV-1 vectors in multiple human airway cell lines. We conclude that the two lentiviruses have similar transduction patterns in human cells, displaying no significant differences in efficiency. However, both lentiviral vectors were less efficient than control B-MLV in porcine cells, suggesting that some restriction is present.

There is some debate as to where fusion occurs with wild-type SARS-coronavirus.

The PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO (45-0641; Invitrogen). Following ClaI and SphI enzymatic digestion, pig TRIM5 was ligated into pCAGGs vector plasmid57 creating pCAGGs-pigTRIM5. Dicer substrate RNAi duplexes against pig TRIM5 were designed using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) online RNAi design software. Three duplexes were tested individually (100 and 10 nmol/l) by reverse transfecting 4 \u00d7 104 cells per well of PK1 cells in 48-well dishes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (13778; Invitrogen).

Two days after transfection, mRNA levels of porcine TRIM5 were measured by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master kit (4304437; ABI, Grand Island, NY).
