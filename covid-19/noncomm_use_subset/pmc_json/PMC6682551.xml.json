They digest the proteins in our food, degrade misfolded or unwanted proteins and regulate the trafficking and activity of numerous cellular factors. Proteolytic cleavage is certainly one of the most important post\u2010translational modifications, generating a plethora of bioactive proteins and peptides with key roles in cell proliferation, immunity and inflammation. Not surprisingly, mutations in proteases and/or aberrant protease activity are associated with numerous pathological processes including cancer, cardiovascular disorders and autoimmune diseases.1 Intriguingly, also many viral pathogens exploit cellular proteases for the proteolytic processing and maturation of their own proteins. Similarly, activation of bacterial toxins frequently requires cleavage by proteases of the infected or intoxicated host.",

In this review, we summarise our current knowledge of furin\u2010mediated protein processing in health and disease with a focus on the role of furin in viral protein processing. Furthermore, we describe cellular mechanisms regulating furin activity at the transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional level.

Although furin is ubiquitously expressed, its mRNA and protein levels vary depending on the cell type and tissue. High levels can be found in salivary glands, liver and bone marrow, whereas muscle cells express relatively low amounts of furin.9 Three promoters (P1, P1A and P1B), each harbouring an alternative transcription start site, have been described (Figure 2). However, the respective transcripts differ only in the first untranslated exon and are therefore predicted to express the same protein.10 While the P1A and P1B promoters resemble those of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes, the P1 promoter binds the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 and can be trans\u2010activated upon cytokine stimulation.10 In line with this, IFN\u03b3, TGF\u03b2, IL\u201012 and PMA induce furin expression.11, 12, 13, 14\n",

Similar to other proprotein convertases, furin contains an inhibitory N\u2010terminal 83\u2010amino acid propeptide, whose chaperone function is required for correct folding of the catalytic domain.15 During the transition of furin from the ER to the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN), the inhibitory propeptide is removed in a two\u2010step autoproteolytic process and furin gains its enzymatic activity.16 At the same time, N\u2010linked oligosaccharides are added and trimmed. Although furin accumulates in the TGN, it can be further transported to the cell surface and back via the endosomal pathway.17, 18 Finally, furin can also be shed and released into the extracellular space upon proteolytic separation of the catalytic domain from the membrane\u2010bound C terminus.19 Whether this cleavage step is mediated by furin itself or another protease remains to be determined.20 The presence of furin in the TGN and endosomal compartments, at the cell surface and in the extracellular space, may explain its ability to process a large variety of intra\u2010 and extracellular substrates.",

Although a furin target sequence is conserved among all Shiga\u2010like toxins, mutational analyses suggested that furin\u2010mediated cleavage augments toxin activity, but is not essential.39 Another well\u2010characterised example is anthrax toxin, a three\u2010protein exotoxin consisting of the receptor binding protective antigen (PA) and the enzymatically active components oedema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). Upon binding to its receptor, PA is cleaved by furin at the cell surface. This cleavage step triggers the oligomerisation of PA into a prepore that binds EF and LF.

Proteolytic cleavage at this site is only efficient if additional positively charged amino acids upstream of this cleavage motif are present or if attachment sites for masking oligosaccharide chains are missing.59, 60 Notably, a subset of H9N2 lowly pathogenic avian influenza A virus strains also harbour R\u2010S\u2010K\u2010R\u2193 or R\u2010S\u2010R\u2010R\u2193 sites that are not only cleaved by trypsin\u2010like proteases, such as TMPRSS2 or HAT, but also by PCSKs.61 However, their cleavage is only efficient in the presence of very high amounts of furin or upon mutation of a glycosylation site in HA.62 Thus, the ability to exploit furin for efficient HA cleavage and the associated increase in pathogenicity are not only determined by the presence of a furin consensus target site, but also by adjacent residues and the absence of masking oligosaccharide chains.",

For example, several substrates such as dengue virus prM harbour suboptimal furin target sequences and may optimise their cleavage sites upon therapy to enable sufficient cleavage in the presence of inhibitors.",

Furin expression is driven by three different promoters, sharing characteristics of either cytokine\u2010activated (P1) or housekeeping gene (P1A and P1B) promoters. During translation, furin is integrated into ER membranes and glycosylated. After the N\u2010terminal signal peptide (red) is removed, an autocatalytic cleavage event occurs, generating a short propeptide (light blue). This propeptide remains associated with furin and acts as an intramolecular chaperone and inhibitor. After transit to the Golgi complex, the propeptide is removed and glycans are trimmed before furin gains its proteolytic activity. Furin accumulates in the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN), but can also traffic to the plasma membrane and cycle between these two compartments via endosomes. Proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus of furin separates the transmembrane domain (orange) from the catalytically active domain.

While some viral proteins are proteolytically processed during maturation or egress (a), others are cleaved during entry into new target cells (b). (a) In case of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (left panel), the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein precursor (green) migrates through the ER to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by furin (pink scissors) into the functional mature Env glycoprotein (blue). Processed Env glycoproteins are transported to the cell surface and incorporated into assembling viral particles. In contrast, dengue viruses bud into the ER lumen and incorporate the uncleaved premembrane protein (prM) (right panel). During virus particle transit through the secretory pathway, virion\u2010associated prM proteins can be cleaved by furin (dark blue to light blue). (b) Some prM molecules escape furin\u2010mediated cleavage in the producer cells resulting in the release of immature or partially mature dengue virus particles. In this case, processing can also occur in endosomes of new target cells, upon receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis (left panel). During human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (right panel), attachment to heparan sulphate proteoglycans induces a conformational change that allows proteolytic processing of the minor capsid protein L2 (red) by furin, which is present at the cell surface. Furin processing induces a structural rearrangement that allows binding to a secondary receptor and subsequent receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis.",

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles containing functional mature envelope (Env) glycoproteins fuse with the plasma membrane of the target cell to release the capsid core into the host cell cytoplasm. Upon reverse transcription and integration of the retroviral genome, viral gene expression is initiated. (a) In a cytokine (e.g. IL\u20101\u03b2)\u2010induced inflammatory state, furin and protease\u2010activated receptor 1 (PAR1) expression are induced. Furin and PAR1 interact with each other and are trapped as inactive proteins in the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN). As a consequence, PAR1 cannot traffic to the cell surface, where it is usually cleaved by thrombin to induce inflammatory signalling pathways. Moreover, production of infectious HIV\u20101 particles is impaired because of reduced furin\u2010mediated cleavage of HIV Env. (b) At the same time, cells of the infected host may induce the expression of interferon\u2010stimulated genes such as guanylate\u2010binding proteins 2 and 5 (GBP2 and GBP5). Both proteins colocalise with furin and inhibit its proteolytic activity. As a result, HIV Env maturation is impaired and newly forming viral particles are poorly infectious since they incorporate immature Env glycoproteins.
