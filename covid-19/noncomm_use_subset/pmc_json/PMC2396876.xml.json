Although this region incorporates several regions with predicted low propensity for coiled-coil formation (Hoiczyk et al, 2000), UspA1(527\u2013665) was found to form a contiguous, extended coiled-coil structure within the crystal lattice (Figure 2). Whereas earlier estimates of UspA1 oligomer composition were ambiguous, the crystal structure confirms that three polypeptide strands coalesce to form a left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. In each chain, there is clear electron density for 135 of the 139 amino acids with four residues (527\u2013530) being disordered at the N terminus of each chain (this and all subsequent sequence numbering refers to UspA1 from the M. catarrhalis MX2 strain). As the trimer lies along the crystallographic three-fold axis, the conformation of each monomer within the trimer is identical. There are two monomers within the asymmetric unit and both are highly similar (root mean square deviation of all equivalent C\u03b1's=1.3 \u00c5). The resulting rod-like structure is approximately 200 \u00c5 long and 20 \u00c5 in diameter.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, UspA1(527\u2013665) forms the longest segment of triple coiled-coil for which a high-resolution structure has been determined. Overall, the average periodicity of the coil is 3.5 residues per turn with a pitch of about 150 \u00c5, close to the expected hypothetical geometry (Lupas, 1996). Analysis of the structure with the coiled-coil software SOCKET (Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001) identified 84 \u2018knobs into holes' interactions; all are of type 4 with packing angles of between 45 and 60\u00b0 as commonly observed in trimers. Although UspA1(527\u2013665) appears to adopt a classic trimeric coiled-coil structure, there are a number of surprises. Whereas most of the internal hydrophobic residues (positions a and d by the standard convention; Lupas, 1996) are a mixture of alanines, isoleucines, valines and asparagines\u2014as expected for trimeric coiled-coils\u2014this pattern is disrupted at residue 573 when, unusually, a histidine is incorporated at a d position within the core. This is seen again three turns later at histidine 584 (position a) and then further after another 12 turns at histidine 629 (position d). For both histidines 584 and 629, the potential charge these residues incorporate within the core appears to be ameliorated through the incorporation of a bound phosphate ion. These ions are located equidistant (3.0 \u00c5) from the histidine of each monomer (Figure 2B and C). The histidine rings are partially orientated through formation of a bifurcated hydrogen bond between each phosphate oxygen, a bound water, the main chain carbonyl group of Leu 580 (at His 584) and interactions with the neighbouring side chain of Ser 630 (at His 629). It is not clear whether binding of these phosphate ions, presumably from the crystallisation buffer, is biologically relevant.",

Circular dichroism (CD) was used to assay the helical content of UspA1(527\u2013665) in response to changes in pH (Figure 3). These data indicated a sharp transition from a helical folded structure (assumed to be coiled-coil) to random coil once the pH dropped below 4.8. Protonation of the histidine side chains (normally expected to occur at pH 6, but often reduced in hydrophobic core regions), introducing repulsive positive charges within the core of the trimer, would be expected to be incompatible with trimer assembly. However, these data also confirm that the coiled-coil form must prevail at physiological pH.",

In all cases, self-aggregation and the extended shape of UspA1(527\u2013665) lead to non-ideal behaviour, complicating the data interpretation. On GPC, UspA1(527\u2013665) runs anomalously, eluting with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa (expected mass of trimer 45 494), whereas N-CEACAM1 (expected mass 11 747) appeared to be 19.5 kDa, perhaps reflecting its known propensity for homo-dimerisation (Watt et al, 2001) (Figure 4A). The complex of UspA1(527\u2013665) with N-CEACAM1 eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa; this peak broadening on the addition of excess N-CEACAM1. Similarly, global fit analysis of sedimentation equilibrium AUC data (Figure 4B) indicated a mass of 27 237 for N-CEACAM1 suggesting a dimer, and a mass of 43 896 for UspA1(527\u2013665) indicative of a trimer. Determination of the mass of their complex was complicated by pronounced pressure effects (Kegeles et al, 1967) that lead to a reduction in observed apparent mass at higher speeds. Global fit analysis of the lower speed data for the complex gave a mass of 74 162, which appears consistent with one UspA1(527\u2013665) trimer binding either one N-CEACAM1 dimer or two monomers, although lower masses were obtained from the higher speed data. Aggregation of UspA1(527\u2013665) and competing homo-dimerisation of N-CEACAM1 (Watt et al, 2001) also affected the quality of the ITC data (Figure 4C). However, these data confirm each trimer of UspA1(527\u2013665) can readily bind up to two molecules of N-CEACAM1 (N=2.0\u00b10.2) with high affinity (estimated KD 24\u00b122 nM), after which only weak, possibly nonspecific, further association is observed. Taking into account the limitations of each of these techniques in analysing this complex association event, in summary we concluded that each trimer of UspA1(527\u2013665) provides a high-affinity binding site for a maximum of two molecules of N-CEACAM1.",

Each of the mutants was selected and designed to have minimal impact on the coiled-coil formation. The mutants made are shown in Figure 5A and include changes to amino acids expected to be exposed at the binding interface (L583A, M586A, A588Q and A590Q), a double mutation (M586A/A588Q) and a control substitution (A568Q) from outside the predicted region of the N-CEACAM1 interaction. Western blotting was used to confirm that in each case the purified mutant protein retained the ability to form trimers indicative of retention of the coiled-coil structure (Supplementary data). This was further confirmed for the double mutant (M586A/A588Q) where the CD spectra of both the native and mutant proteins were found to be essentially identical (Figure 3B) and only a minor thermodynamic difference was observed in their melting temperatures (41 and 39\u00b0C, respectively; Figure 3C). These observations confirm that the amino-acid substitutions introduced do not affect the structure or assembly of the coiled-coil, indicating that altered binding effects are likely to arise from direct contacts of these amino acids with N-CEACAM1 rather than by disruption of the UspA1 gross structure.",

Combining these earlier results, we surmised that the UspA1-binding site must at least partially overlap with the site also used by Nm and Hi. We therefore mutated I91 and surrounding residues on CEACAM1 to define the extent of the UspA1-binding site. In ELISA studies, binding of N-CEACAM1 to UspA1(527\u2013665) was significantly impaired when I91 was mutated to Ala, and moderate reductions in binding accompanied mutation of surrounding residues Y34, Q44 and G47, whereas little or no effect was noted for the mutations of S32, T56, V39, V96 and Q89 (Figure 5A and Supplementary data). No reduction in binding was also noted for V39A, confirming UspA1 binds to the monomeric form of CEACAM1 as this mutation has previously been shown to abolish dimerisation (Watt et al, 2001). Interestingly, the introduction of a leucine side chain to CEACAM1 position 56 partially restored binding to the UspA1 L583A mutant. From our model of the complex (see below) it was anticipated that these mutations should be compensatory.",

This preliminary model was built by comparing the respective sites identified by site-directed mutagenesis, manually assembling the two surfaces in the most complementary orientation (Figure 5A) followed by energy minimisation of the complex. This generated an interface in which the UspA1 residues M586 and A590 are in close proximity to I91 of the receptor, UspA1 A588 is adjacent to Y34, V39 and Q89 of CEACAM1 and UspA1 L583 lies next to Q44, G47 and T56 of CEACAM1. These residues form the region identified by the mutagenesis studies to affect binding. The complementary nature of these surfaces was only marred by a small protrusion of the F/G loop of N-CEACAM1, a region that is involved in a homo-dimerisation interaction around a two-fold axis in the crystal structure (Fedarovich et al, 2006). It is likely that this conformation is not maintained within the monomeric form of N-CEACAM1 which, as confirmed by the binding of the monomeric V39A mutant (Watt et al, 2001), is the active form for binding to UspA1 (Supplementary data). Although the actual conformation of the F/G loop in this form is uncertain, we noted that on energy minimisation of the complex this region protrudes into a distinctive cavity formed at the interface (Figure 5A), possibly assisting partial unwinding of the coiled-coil assembly. The surface area occupied by the N-CEACAM1 molecule is approximately one-third of the circumferential surface area in the proposed binding site region of the UspA1 trimeric structure, implying that three N-CEACAM1 molecules could bind simultaneously. This is in contrast to the AUC and ITC data (Figure 4) which show that, in practice, only two N-CEACAM1 molecules bind with high affinity to UspA1(527\u2013665).",

Although the data indicate a diversity of potential fits, all of the shapes share the same essential features: the complex is seen to be elongated and is of comparable dimensions (approximately 200 \u00c5 in total length, 20\u201330 \u00c5 in diameter) to the UspA1 crystal structure. Distinctively, however, there is a significant bend in the molecule (30\u201360\u00b0 deflection from the linear form in the various models), resulting in a \u2018boomerang' shape. Adjacent to the apex of this bend there is a thickening of the envelope, approximately sufficient to accommodate two N-CEACAM1 domains. Bending of the UspA1 rod was approximated by splitting the modelled complex into four equal lengths. These were fitted to the scattering data as separate rigid bodies using the software SASREF (Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005). A complete model of the complex was generated by rejoining of the UspA1 polypeptide chains followed by energy minimisation. This model was then fitted to the scattering data using the software CRYSOL (Svergun et al, 1995), which resulted in a \u03c7 value of 1.45. By contrast, attempts to fit the predicted scattering from a complex in which UspA1(527\u2013665) retained a straight rod-like shape produced significantly poorer correlation with the experimental data (\u03c7 value of 3.11; Figure 6A).",

The absence of strong binding to the third site implies distortion of this remaining site, and hence of the UspA1 molecule. Finally, using transmission electron microscopy (Supplementary data), we have also observed that UspA1 appears to adopt not only extended structures in the surface array of Mx but significant perturbations also appear to be more prevalent in the presence of CEACAM1 receptor. Through gene deletions (Hoiczyk et al, 2000) it has previously been established that the most extended molecules at the Mx surface predominantly comprise UspA1. This demonstrates that both linear and distorted conformations of UspA1 are possible on the bacterial surface (Supplementary data). Although the resolution in these studies is insufficient to correlate the shapes observed directly with the structural model of the complex presented herein, these changes are consistent with the SAXS observations, and molecular dynamics simulations.",

            "text": "Coiled-coil motifs have been increasingly identified within a wide range of proteins and are believed to perform a variety of roles delivered by extended, relatively rigid structures (reviewed in Lupas, 1996). Although many coiled-coil proteins are dimeric, parallel trimeric coiled-coil structures have been reported for a number of viral and bacterial proteins, including the influenza hemagglutinin (Wilson et al, 1981; Bullough et al, 1994), murine leukaemia virus spike protein (Fass et al, 1996), mannose-binding protein (Sheriff et al, 1994) and in the stalk of the head group of the UspA1-related protein YadA (Nummelin et al, 2004). In all of these cases, the trimeric structure acts as a stalk to project other bio-active domains away from the pathogen membrane. In none of these cases, however, does the coiled-coil region itself act as ligand, instead playing a supporting structural role. The partial structure of UspA1 reported in this study is different. First, at about 200 \u00c5 in length (double the extended hemagglutinin structure), UspA1(527\u2013665) represents the longest stretch of trimeric coiled-coil for which a detailed structure is available. Second, UspA1 is unusual in utilising an extended stretch of regular coiled-coil as a receptor-binding domain. This is the first definitive example of this function for a trimeric coiled-coil, but it is likely there are others. For example, the M-like fibrinogen (Fg)-binding protein from the equine-specific bacterium Streptococcus equi has also previously been reported to contain an Fc-receptor-binding region within a multimeric coiled-coil stalk (Meehan et al, 2002), although no structural details are available.",

This arrangement is consistent with the linear structure observed for the uncomplexed form of UspA1(527\u2013665) within the crystal lattice; maximisation of crystal contacts would be expected to favour this form. At the bacterial surface, close packing of adhesins might be encouraged by the hydrophobic nature of the ligand-binding site and may, through restricting access of large antibodies, confer some protection of this region from immune recognition. This arrangement, however, presents a problem in that the resulting physical locations of the respective ligand/receptor pair seem incongruous to permit sufficiently close approach of bacterial and human cell membranes to allow effective adherence via the CEACAM1-binding site. Electron microscopy studies indicate UspA1 extends approximately 600\u2013700 \u00c5 from the bacterial cell surface (Hoiczyk et al, 2000). This is consistent with the expected length of an extended coiled-coil segment (residues 333\u2013742) of which UspA1(527\u2013665) represents approximately one-third (200 \u00c5). In the fully extended intact ligand, the receptor-binding site would therefore be located at least 450 \u00c5 from the membrane-distal end of UspA1. In contrast, its receptor site on human CEACAM1\u2014by analogy with its similar construction to CD4 for which an overall structure is known (Wu et al, 1997)\u2014can reach no further than about 120 \u00c5 from the epithelial cell surface. Even if the receptor is primarily located within the highly invaginated microvilli of epithelial cells (Hammarstrom, 1999) the sheer bulk created by the length of the extended head group would seem to present a steric difficulty for placing the ligand and receptor in close proximity. Two explanations seem possible. The head group of UspA1 may insert into the epithelial cell membrane prior to attachment of CEACAM1, allowing the base of the stalk region to come into closer proximity to epithelial cell surface. Alternatively, as suggested by this study, the stalk of UspA1 is capable of changing conformation to allow closer approach of the two respective membranes (Figure 1B).",

            "text": "Deformability of the UspA1 stalk region is demonstrated by the solution scattering studies, where in the presence of its CEACAM1 receptor UspA1(527\u2013665) displays a distinctive curvature (bending angle of approximately 30\u201360\u00b0). This implies that in its receptor complex the UspA1 stalk has increased flexibility. Although self-aggregation prevents us from accurately interpreting similar solution scattering data collected in the absence of CEACAM1, the change in the scattering curve that accompanies addition of the receptor (Figure 6A) is consistent with an alteration in the molecular structure. Further, as the crystal structure shows UspA1(527\u2013665) to be symmetrical there appears to be no inherent mechanism for it to adopt a discrete bend (an asymmetric structure) in the absence of other effectors. This is supported by the molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that the extended structure exhibits a degree of flexibility, but remains rod-like overall. In contrast, the same simulations conducted in the presence of bound N-CEACAM1 reveal a \u2018weak spot' within the trimeric coiled-coil in the vicinity of residue 610, equidistant between the CEACAM1-binding site and the stutter and coincident with the incorporation of internally bound ions (Figures 2 and 6). Binding of N-CEACAM1, therefore, seems to provide a mechanism to \u2018break' the three-fold symmetry and hence encourage formation of the bowed structure. The asymmetry produced by the bending is likely to distort remaining binding sites generated by the inherent three-fold symmetry, accounting for the observation that a maximum of two N-CEACAM1 molecules readily associate with each UspA1 trimer. Binding of receptor may also disrupt interactions of this hydrophobic region with neighbouring copies of UspA1 (akin to disruption of aggregation in the SAXS studies). The observation of curvature of UspA1 when in complex with its receptor noted in the solution scattering studies is supported by (i) the molecular dynamics simulations; (ii) the electron microscopy studies of the Mx cell surface where significant perturbations of the adhesin \u2018forest' are observed and (iii) is a logical inference from the AUC and ITC measurements of a maximal stoichiometry of two molecules of N-CEACAM1 can bind with high affinity to each trimer of UspA1. In combination, these data support the concept of increased flexibility and the ability to adopt a distinctly bowed structure when UspA1(527\u2013665) binds to its N-CEACAM1 receptor.",

            "text": "It is possible that this potential for the stalk region of UspA1 to bend within this discrete region may arise from the internal histidines and/or the stutter within the UspA1(527\u2013665) coiled-coil, which appear unique to this part of UspA1. The CD unfolding data highlight the marked instability of the coiled-coil structure to decreases in pH. Considering also the adjacent stutter, this whole region may be readily susceptible to the types of deformation seen in the SAXS analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and EM studies. By corollary, the extended triple coiled-coil in influenza hemagglutinin incorporates both buried histidines and several stutters along its length (Bullough et al, 1994) and is believed to be metastable\u2014allowing a dramatic re-modelling to take place as the pH is changed. The stimulus that instigates the conformational change in UspA1\u2014whether chemical or mechanical\u2014is unknown. It is possible that the composition of this region simply makes it more susceptible to deformation in response to mechanical force. Electron microscopy studies of UspA1 (Hoiczyk et al, 2000 and Supplementary data) and the related protein EmaA (Ruiz et al, 2006) at their respective cell surfaces indicate that a variety of conformations are observed but distinctive kinks are evident in both cases. Bending may be initially required to allow access for the receptor, which then stabilises this conformation by breaking the three-fold symmetry of the UspA1 stalk.",
