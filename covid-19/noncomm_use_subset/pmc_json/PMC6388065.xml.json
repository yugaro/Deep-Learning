This illness has been named Middle East respiratory syndrome and the pathogen (MERS\u2010CoV) has been shown to be a type of coronavirus that is highly related to SARS\u2010CoV. Infection with MERS\u2010CoV results in higher mortality and new symptoms such as renal failure. Thus, failure to fully resolve the initial SARS pathogen has been followed by a more virulent infection with a related virus, MERS\u2010CoV. Therefore, we need urgently to identify the origins of the viruses and find ways to deal with them. To make a useful comparison, this review will investigate the reservoirs of infection and provide an overview of the animal models for both viruses.",

If that speculation proves true, the convention in the Middle East of cooking and trading camel meat and organs might be the interspecies transmission route. MERS\u2010CoV can also survive longer in camel milk than in other ruminant milk. In addition to the above two routes, MERS\u2010CoV RNA can be detected in 59% of nasal discharge and 15% of feces in camels. Thus, there is supportive evidence for the three postulated transmission routes, but further verification is needed to confirm them.
