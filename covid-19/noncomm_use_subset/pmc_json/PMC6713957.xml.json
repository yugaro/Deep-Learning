Between 1949 and 1978, the Chinese health care system was designed with the objective to provide \u201cequal access for all regardless of ability to pay,\u201d an ideology championed by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong.1 To achieve this goal, the Chinese government assumed control of all aspects of health care and delivery\u2014it provided funding for the construction of hospitals and clinics, paid health workers a fixed salary, and set the prices for medicines and services.2 At that time, all physicians became employees of public hospitals, establishing the foundation of the current dominating role of public hospitals, especially tertiary-level public hospitals in China.3",

First, governmental subsidies to public health care facilities declined dramatically after 1978. The government\u2019s subsidies to public hospitals fell to merely 10% of their total expenditures by the 1990s,5 and 90% or more of Chinese public hospitals\u2019 revenue continued to depend on drug sales and services in 2010.6 While Chinese public hospitals continued to have a bureaucratic and complex government-run regulation and management system,3 they also were expected to behave like for-profit entities to earn profit to survive and to continue being competitive in the health care market.7 Second, because labor-related medical services remained underpriced,8 the Chinese government set a higher margin rate for high-technology procedures and diagnostic tests, and hospitals are allowed to charge a 15% to 25% mark-up on drug sales (15% for Western medicine and 25% for Traditional Chinese Medicine).9 Such policies provided financial incentives for hospitals to begin a \u201cmedical arms race\u201d to scale up their provision of high-technology diagnostics and interventions, as well as to overprescribe drugs.10-12 Third, most of senior physicians\u2019 income from hospitals is still a combination of basic salary and bonus,13 with the bonus coming from hospitals\u2019 financial profit.14 To increase their hospital\u2019s profit, hospital management tied the physicians\u2019 bonus to their contribution to hospital profits, which has intensified the overprescription of drugs and overuse of diagnostic tests.5,7,8,10-12,15-17 Such an extrinsic bonus incentive method may also \u201ccrowd-out\u201d physicians\u2019 intrinsic concerns for other important aspects of health care, for example, the health care quality and population health.18 Some scholars have commented that these financial incentives even may have directly eroded physicians\u2019 ethics.17,19 Because of this strong alignment of financial incentives, senior physicians in effect can become more the agents for public hospitals rather than for their patients.",

Substantial evidence has shown that the financial tie between physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals is a critical reason for much of existing inefficiency or even misuse of health care resources.11,12,16 More recently, the existing strong financial relation between senior physicians and tertiary public hospitals also has jeopardized efforts to create competition from emerging private hospitals as well as reform measures that allow physicians to practice among multiple health care facilities. The eventual goal of current Chinese health care reforms is to create a market with providers of numerous ownership, including public and for-profit private hospitals, and to redistribute physician resources from currently dominating public hospitals to other settings. To achieve this long-term goal with sustainable physician-patient and physician-hospital agency relations, a systematically well-developed physician professionalism system will also be necessary.",

In addition, as the function, goal, and financial sources for health care facilities in rural areas, and also for secondary level and community-based primary care systems in urban settings, are very different than those of tertiary-level public hospitals,17 physicians practicing at these lower intensity health care facilities should be paid using the current approach until the Chinese version of RBRVS is operating and mature.",

The Chinese government has tried to leverage private hospital investment, use policy to promote physicians\u2019 mobility, and change reimbursement policy, to overcome these barriers. However, the financial relations between large public hospitals and senior physicians still allow public hospitals to design mechanisms to maintain their dominating positions.

Physicians are multitasking agents in health care services, and some outcomes of their tasks are more difficult to evaluate than others.34 Even in the United States and other Western developed countries, establishing provider payment systems that create effective incentives for both cost control and quality improvement is difficult.62 The Chinese health care system is moving toward case-based or diagnosis-related group-based reimbursement approach for hospitals.66 Under such a prospective payment system, how physicians balance hospital interests, their own income, and patients\u2019 benefits is a crucial measure of the physicians\u2019 care decisions.67 If physicians\u2019 personal income is still tied to their employer hospitals\u2019 profit and hospital-designed financial incentives, however, it may be more likely that physicians will continue to prioritize hospital\u2019s or their own profit rather than patients\u2019 interest. A study on the impact of reimbursement method change from fee-for-service to per-diem for a Chinese public psychiatric hospital illustrated that the payment policy had not achieved its anticipated goals because physicians\u2019 behaviors were still tied to the original financial incentives the hospital had designed.68",
