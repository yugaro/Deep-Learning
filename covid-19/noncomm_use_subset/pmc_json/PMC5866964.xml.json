Several calves displayed mucosal lesions and excessive salivation, 5 calves displayed yellow plaques on their incisors. Calf 9 was infested by numerous Damalinia. Seven calves displayed signs of weakness: weight shifting from 1 hind leg to the other and sudden bending of knees (5 calves), constant muscle tremor (Calf 3), and inability to rise (Calf 1). Calves 3 and 5 were extremely exhausted, did not move after being placed in lateral recumbency and fell into deep sleep immediately.

Decreased serum zinc concentrations can be associated with chronic inflammation as well. Additionally, the chronic enteritis and the catabolic state of the calves could be the cause of hypoalbuminemia. The concentrations of the trace elements copper and iron were below reference ranges in 3/7 and 4/5 calves, respectively. The low iron concentrations can be caused by the chronic inflammatory state or reduced alimentary uptake because of disease\u2010associated anorexia. However, the causes and connections of the metabolic disturbances in these calves are not known. As copper, iron, and zinc concentrations also have synergistic and antagonistic properties in physiological states, the reason for the observed concentration changes in this disease deserves further study.",

Calf 9 was treated with 10\u201316 mg elementary zinc per day. This dose appears really low when compared to the other calves and its effects were probably minor (low serum zinc concentrations). Although serum zinc concentrations are not always useful to determine tissue zinc concentrations,28 elevation after treatment indicates that intestinal uptake took place.
