Data associated with the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus\n(PEDV) infections in each herd were investigated by 15 veterinarians belonging to the Japan\nAssociation of Swine Veterinarians (JASV). From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any\nherds with clinical signs of PED and feces that tested positive for PEDV with polymerase\nchain reaction and/or immunohistochemical staining at local livestock hygiene centers were\ndefined as PED-positive. Herds that showed no clinical signs of PED or were negative for\nPEDV on the abovementioned laboratory tests were classified as negative. Herds for which\nthere was no information on PED status, with missing data, or in which PED was confirmed\nbefore 31 March 2014 were excluded from the study. The final sample sizes in the\nPED-positive and PED-negative groups were 38 and 61 herds, respectively. For all\nPED-positive herds, the participating veterinarians recorded the types of barns in which the\npigs showed clinical symptoms. In the PED-positive herds, the dates of the initial PED\ndiagnosis and the disappearance of clinical signs from the herd were also recorded by the\nveterinarians. The PED period for each PED-positive herd was defined as the number of days\nbetween the initial PED diagnosis and the disappearance of clinical signs. The PED-positive\nherds were then further classified into those with a long PED period (\u226530 days;\nL-PED-positive; n=28) and those with a short PED period (<30 days; S-PED-positive; n=10).\nThis cutoff value (30 days) for the PED period was determined by visually inspecting the\ndistribution of PED periods. Thus, the targeted herds were classified into three groups\n(PED-negative, L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive), and their productivity, characterized\nwith the production parameters described below, was compared during the study period.",

For example, the average preweaning\nmortality was significantly higher in April-June 2014 than at other time points. The mean\nvalues of all the parameters differed significantly at different time points, so the time\nfactor was significantly associated with all the variables investigated in this study.

A previous observational study indicated that only pregnant sows\nand gilts infected with PED at 0\u201330 days of pregnancy had smaller litters, whereas those\ninfected at other points during the gestation period were not affected by PED [11]. If litter sizes are only reduced by PEDV infection\nwithin a particular gestational stage, the calculation of herd-level PBA, as used in the\npresent study, may be insufficient to demonstrate the actual effects of PED status on the\nsubsequent litter size.",

However, the L-PED-positive herds, and to a lesser extent the S-PED-positive\nherds, had fewer MP than the PED-negative herds during this period in 2014 (Fig. 6), approximately 180 days (fattening period)\nafter the PED epidemic. This was a direct consequence of the reduced number of weaned pigs,\ncaused by piglet death and slaughtering during the PED epidemic. The fact that the\nS-PED-positive herds had higher MP than the L-PED-positive herds indicates that the rapid\ncontrol of an outbreak (<30 days) is economically justified because it increases the\nnumber of pigs available for marketing.",
