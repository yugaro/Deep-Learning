This new virus, initially emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, led to a sharply spreading outbreak of human respiratory disease (COVID-2019), both within People\u2019s Republic of China and in several other countries worldwide. On March 9 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Currently, Italy is the second most affected country by COVID-19 infection after China. The first autochthonous infection case was confirmed in Italy on February 21 2020 and up to now (March 12), 12462 cases with 827 deaths have been registered in Italy. Considering the recent evolution of Italian epidemiologic picture, many health-care facilities will be likely in charge of managing patients affected by COVID-19 in the next days. The \u201cL. Spallanzani\u201d National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, IRCCS has been the first Italian hospital to admit patients affected by COVID-19. Therefore, it will be useful to share the protocol for the clinical management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, applied within our Institute, in order to support other facilities that may have a limited experience in treating COVID-19 patients.",
