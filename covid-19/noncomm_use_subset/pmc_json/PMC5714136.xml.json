The patient did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis, nor did he have a prior history of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination. He flew to Phuket, before traveling north to the popular tourist destination of Khao Lak, where he stayed in a beachside holiday resort. Heavy rainfall occurred during the trip, which limited holiday activities. He did not travel to rural or remote areas, but did receive numerous mosquito bites. On the eighth day of travel, he became unwell with lethargy and generalized muscle aches. He flew to Bangkok on the ninth day of the trip, and over the following 3 days his symptoms included ongoing lethargy, poor appetite, and drenching sweats, but no headache, meningism, or confusion. He returned to Australia on day 12 of travel and was admitted to a regional hospital the following day, now the fifth day after symptoms commenced (Figure 1).",

In a 2011 systematic review, it was estimated that 67 900 cases occur annually [1]. The traditional diagnostic paradigm for JEV infection has been based on the understanding that the period of viremia is short-lived, and hence the utility of PCR is limited. As a result, most cases are diagnosed serologically [2]. Serological diagnosis may be complicated by cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses or the need for follow-up samples to look for a rise in antibody titre over time. Here we report prolonged detection of JEV in both urine and whole blood, but not in plasma or CSF samples, which are most commonly tested for diagnostic purposes. If reproducible in other cases, these findings could significantly improve laboratory diagnostics for JEV and provide new insights into the viral dynamics of JEV.",

This is an interesting finding in light of recent detection of a number of other flaviviruses in urine samples, including Zika, Dengue, and West Nile Virus (WNV) [4\u20135]. This is only the second reported case of detection of JEV RNA in urine, with the first reported case initially detected via deep sequencing [6]. We demonstrate prolonged detection of JEV in urine to day 26. These findings are in contrast to a report from China, where JEV RNA was not detected by real-time PCR from the urine of 52 children with serologically confirmed infection [7]. Our experience with a single, possibly exceptional case has been different, and the reasons why are not clear. This might reflect differences in the patients studied, the diagnostic assays employed, or the timing of the urine samples collected. Our PCR assay targeted loci within the NS5 region, in contrast to the consensus NS3 region targeted in the previous report. Alternatively, in the previous report [7], all urine specimens were collected early on in illness (3\u20139 days after onset) whereas the first urine specimen tested in our patient was 14 days after the onset of symptoms.",

JEV RNA was detectable in whole blood, but not plasma, out to the final specimen tested, 28 days after the onset of illness. Testing of whole blood by PCR has not traditionally been performed due to the potential presence of inhibitors [11]; however, this report and other recent publications suggest that testing of whole blood may offer additional diagnostic information in certain situations. Notably, West Nile virus has been found to bind to red blood cells (RBCs), and the WNV viral load in RBC components has been found to exceed that in plasma by 1 order of magnitude [12].",

Vaccination to JEV is generally only recommended to travelers who intend to spend 1 or more months in endemic areas during the transmission season, although consideration may be given to short-term travelers who may be at increased risk of exposure or who plan to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak [13]. A further notable aspect of our case is acquisition of JEV following short-term travel to an area that would not normally be considered high risk. Interestingly, in a 2009 review on JEV in travelers, more than half of 21 cases were acquired after short-term travel [14]. Given the improved tolerability of modern vaccine preparations and the potentially devastating consequences of infection, it has been suggested that current vaccination recommendations should be revised to offer vaccination to a broader range of travelers [14]. A short-term traveler who visits JEV endemic areas should be informed about the risk of disease, potential outcomes, and the risks and benefits of JEV vaccination.",
