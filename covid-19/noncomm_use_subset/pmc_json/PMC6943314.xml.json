CT scan\nrevealed bilateral peribronchial consolidation, swollen jejunum lymph node with uniform\ndistribution of contrast medium, and multiple prominent nodules of the liver (Fig. 3A). These nodules exhibited lower CT values than that of liver parenchyma in plain image\nand were not enhanced with dynamic CT (Fig. 3B).\nContrast enhancement of peripheral areas of the liver nodules was observed in the arterial\nphase; however, it disappeared in the portal vein phase. During bronchoscopy, intratracheal\nforeign bodies, increased mucus production, and redness of bronchial mucosa were not found.\nCytology of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a small number of neutrophils and macrophages\nwithout any bacteria. When FNA cytology of the liver was performed, neutrophils, small\nlymphocytes, and large macrophages were observed. The specimens of bronchoscopy and liver FNA\nwere submitted to research laboratory (Japan Clinical Laboratories, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for\nculture of general bacteria, fungus, and Mycobacterium species. These\nexaminations revealed that general bacteria and fungus were culture-negative, and\nMycobacterium species were smear-negative with Ziehl-Neelsen staining but\nculture-positive in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube systems (Becton, Dickinson and Co.,\nFranklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.).

            "text": "Infections of Mycobacterium species in domestic cats have been reported\nsporadically. In Great Britain, previous reports have revealed that 1.16% of 11,782 feline\ntissue samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories were confirmed to have\nMycobacterium infections [10], and\n15% of cultured Mycobacterium species were M. avium. In\nJapan, Mycobacterium infections in domestic cats have been historically\nuncommon, with only two cases reported: unclassified Mycobacterium species\n(MFM001 strain) [13] and MAH in the Kanto region [20]. This is the third reported case of\nMycobacterium species infection in a domestic cat in Japan. In Japan,\npulmonary NTM diseases are commonly diagnosed in human medicine with an incidence rate of 14.7\ncases per 100,000 person-years in 2016, which is 2.6 times higher than the incidence rate\nreported in 2007 [25]. The most common pathogens of\npulmonary NTM diseases were M. avium in the northern and eastern parts of\nJapan and M. intracellulare in the southern and western parts of Japan.\nMycobacterium infection should also be considered a potential disease for\ndomestic cats. In a previous study in Australia, it was observed that certain lines of\nAbyssinian and Somali cats likely suffer from a familial immunodeficiency that predisposes\nthem to infection with slow-growing mycobacteria, including M. avium [2]. Whilst immunological predisposition of those breeds has\nnot been well proven, it will be beneficial to pay attention to the breed of cats with\nsuspected Mycobacterium infections.",

In domestic\ncats, it was recommended that treatment of feline leprosy syndrome, which was caused by\nMycobacterium species, should ideally be continued for a further 3 months\nafter lesions have regressed in order to reduce the risk of recurrence [23]. However, the optimal length of drug therapy for MAH has not yet been\nestablished. Here, we administered combination antibiotics for 6 months until NTM culture\nyielded negative results, and no symptoms or abnormal findings were detected in X-Ray or\nultrasound images. Further studies might be needed to identify the optimal treatment duration\nof MAH infection.",
