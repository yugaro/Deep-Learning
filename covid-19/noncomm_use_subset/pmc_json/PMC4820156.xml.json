For example, diarrhea associated with infections resulting from oral-fecal contamination is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, primarily in Africa and South Asia (2). A number of diarrhea studies have been carried out in different countries. For instance, in Germany, a nationwide representative cross-sectional telephone survey of 21262 adults over a 12-month period during 2008 and 2009, was conducted. Participants were asked if they had had either AGI-related diarrhea or vomiting in a 4-week recall period. The burden of diarrhea was estimated to be quite high: 0.95 episodes/person per year (95% confidence interval 0\u00b790\u20130\u00b799) (3). In Slovenia, a population-based self-reported acute gastrointestinal infection (AGI) cross sectional study was carried out in June 2011. The comparison of the incidence of AGI-based on notification in June 2011, and incidence-based on the results of the study showed that the latter incidence was 56 times higher than the first one. The burden of AGI among population of Slovenia is quite high. The cross sectional study should be repeated and laboratory analysis of acute AGI cases added to get a better insight of epidemiological situation (4).",

Halving a number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water had an enormous impact on decreasing the incidence of diarrheal diseases (9). A comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. Out of these, 868 (61%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between humans and animals (10). Some pathogens are transmitted by water. For example, viruses that are potentially transmitted by water are: norovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A and E virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A virus, polyoma virus, pikobirna virus, etc. (11).",

Among microbiologically confirmed notified AGI cases, the most frequent ones were noroviral (the incidence rate in 2010 was 21/100 000) and rotaviral infections (the incidence rate 78/100 000). Viral gastrointestinal infections are followed by AGI, caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli. The epidemiological situation in EU countries is similar: Campylobacter infections are the most frequently reported bacterial gastrointestinal infections. In 2010, the total EU incidence was 57/100 000 inhabitants. Reported rates are increasing; most cases are sporadic, with high seasonal peaks in the summer, but multinational outbreaks are infrequent. Salmonella infection remains the second most commonly identified gastrointestinal disease across EU, with the total incidence of 21/100 000 inhabitants in 2010. The reported incidence of Salmonella infection has been declining steadily since 2004, partly due to EU control programmes in poultry farms.

            "text": "The quality of drinking water might, at least partially, be an explanatory variable for the geographical differences in the incidence of AGI in 2010. Notified water-borne outbreaks (WBOs) are rare in Slovenia \u2013 there were 86 WBOs registered between 1981 and 2010 (21). Shigella flexneri and sonnei were the predominant pathogens in the first decade, causing half of the WBOs. The number of notified WBOs has declined in recent years and the aetiology has changed (25). There were only one to two WBOs per year in the last ten years, and most of them were caused by viruses (most often noroviruses) (21). Noroviruses were identified as an important cause of outbreaks in different settings, including WBOs also in Sweden (26). Craun and co-workers (2010) comprehensively described outbreaks associated with drinking water in the US from 1971 to 2006. A drop in the number of notified outbreaks related to drinking water has been observed as well, especially in public systems. The decline was attributed to improved infrastructure and the impact of national regulations (27). Individual water systems and systems supplied by ground water were more at risk of contamination (27). A high prevalence of enteric viruses has been found in untreated individual drinking water sources in Slovenia as well (28). Drinking water quality in Slovenia is generally good, especially in large water supply zones, but it is not of the same quality in all parts of the country: microbiological problems are found in small water supply zones in rural areas, and contamination with nitrates and pesticides in some areas with extensive agriculture (the North-Eastern part of the country). Without doubt, it has not been significantly improved in the 2004\u20132010 period (16).",

The supply zones with more than 10 000 users are less often contaminated, and, if they are, E. coli was found in less than 10% of the water samples taken. The risk for AGI in the larger supply zones was lower for those users who were supplied with contaminated water \u2013 an unexpected finding which is difficult to interpret. It may be that users in large supply zones (mainly in bigger cities) are inclined to drink bottled water and, therefore, the temporary contamination does not have an augmenting effect on AGI. Another possible explanation might be that larger water supply systems are better controlled, that any change in water quality is detected immediately, and that consumers are instructed not to use water for drinking/cooking without boiling.",

The study was performed under the assumption that acute gastrointestinal infections, transmitted directly or indirectly, are uniformly distributed across the country, as there was no major food-borne outbreak affecting one region only. Under ideal conditions, only water-borne AGI cases should be included in the study and compared to microbiology, especially the faecal contamination of drinking water samples taken at approximately the same time as the illness occurred. To conduct a study under these ideal conditions is practically an unreachable goal.",

Therefore, AGI cases residing in settlements with small supply zones (less than 50 users) were not included in the analysis. It would be very interesting to do a study comparing the incidence of AGI in users of the above mentioned supply zones and the microbiological results of drinking water. The recent study showed that enteric viruses were more frequently found in individual water systems compared to public water systems in Slovenia (28).",

That is, while the presence of coliforms could still be taken as a sign of fecal contamination, the absence of coliforms could no longer be taken as a guarantee that water was uncontaminated. Thus, existing bacterial indicators and indicator approaches do not, in all circumstances, identify all potential waterborne pathogens; their presence in water is also \u201cunderreported\u201d. Indeed, no single indicator organism, or a small set of indicators, can successfully identify or predict the presence, let alone the source, of all classes of potential pathogens \u2013 especially emerging microorganisms (20).",
