A recent prospective study from the United States demonstrated that S pneumoniae accounted for 5% of pneumonia requiring admission compared with 20% in this study. A possible explanation may be that Jain et al [12] recovered high-quality sputum samples from only 12% of their participants compared with 31% in this study. Another contributing factor may be more widespread vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in the US population, which had not been introduced in Iceland when this study was performed. Another, smaller study set in the United States found S pneumoniae in 19% of their cohort, which is similar to our results [10]. From Europe, Holter et al [11] recently recovered pneumococci in 30% of admitted CAP patients in Norway where conjugated pneumococcal vaccine is included in the childhood vaccination program. Also of note, if results from nasopharyngeal culture and upper airway PCR are omitted, the rate was 18% [11]. Similarly, Bonten et al [24] found that 21% of CAP cases among those >65 years of age were due to S pneumoniae but did not use PCR diagnostics. In another recent study, Gadsby et al [13] achieved pathogen detection in 87% of patients using PCR methods on sputum samples, with S pneumoniae being identified in 36% of cases. Comparison with our work is difficult, however, because Gadsby et al [13] excluded patients unable to produce sputum. These recent studies support the results of the current study, that 20% of CAP is due to S pneumoniae.",

The decrease in S pneumoniae between these studies and the current one is also in line with the decline in rates of pneumococcal pneumonia during the last century, as reviewed succinctly by Musher et al [30].

It is possible that this reflects the lack of therapeutic response to empiric antimicrobial therapy against pneumonia in the outpatient setting, which commonly consists of \u03b2-lactams, but would be worthy of further study. Conversely, the odds of identifying S pneumoniae were increased in patients without recent antimicrobial use. It is also possible that participants who had received prior treatment had more drawn out symptoms indicative of different etiology. Some previous studies have excluded patients unable to produce sputum or with recent antimicrobial use to improve diagnostic yield [6, 13].

Corresponding results from this study are 5% and 2%, respectively, if cases due to the H1N1 pandemic are excluded (Table 5). Conversely, the median LOS was 3 days in the study by Jain et al [12] compared with 7 in the current study, probably reflecting major differences in management approaches to this problem between a Nordic country and the United States. Holter et al [11] examined a Norwegian cohort with an identical median age to ours and found a similar LOS (7 days), and although 18% were admitted to ICU, the mortality was 4%. It is likely that systemic factors and different thresholds for ICU admission, timing of switching from intravenous to oral, and transfer to outpatient management may explain some of these differences [11, 12].",

It is notable that patients with atypical pathogens had lower PSI and CURB-65 scores than other patients but required similar ICU care and LOS. Because both scores include age as risk factors, the relatively low age of influenza and M pneumoniae patients may offer a partial explanation. Severity scores and outcomes were also similar for patients with an identified virus when compared with other patients. Although pandemic influenza cases heavily influenced this result, they did not account for all morbidity in this group. Patients with dual pathogens had a trend towards worse outcomes, but the number of patients was low and therefore a great potential for type II error.",

Despite the high level of patient inclusion, we were not able to collect all tests for all participants: a more complete sample set might have resulted in the detection of more potential pathogens. We chose to collect oropharyngeal swabs for PCR analysis to optimize sample collection and patient recruitment. It is possible that use of nasopharyngeal samples may have increased sensitivity for respiratory viruses [40]. In addition, an organism identified from the upper airway cannot always be assumed to be the causative agent for pneumonia, and PCR results for some organisms must be interpreted as suggestive for possible etiology. It is also possible that our method of batch analysis and storage may have decreased the sensitivity of our laboratory methods. When comparing the statistical results of this study, the number of relevant variables in comparison with the cohort size, particularly for individual etiologies, must be kept in mind as in other comparable studies. We applied multinomial regression as part of our analysis, but there is a risk of overfitting due to small numbers of individual outcomes, cohort size, and number of variables. The results of direct comparisons are reported alongside these results but must also be interpreted with the number of comparisons in mind. Both of these factors increase the risk of type I error.",
