SciELO began in Brazil and has been extended to other countries. Bioline International is a Canada\u2013Brazil partnership providing a distribution mechanism for publishers from 17 developing and transitional countries. The Medknow publishing house in Mumbai, India, similarly provides free access to about 80 journals that are published primarily in India and that focus on biomedical research. These services, together with a number of society journals from the developing countries, constitute some 20% of all open access journals. Unlike a majority of commercial publishers in the industrial parts of the world, these publishers have no concerns that open access will damage their journals \u2014 quite the contrary, as evidence is now accumulating that visibility leads to quality improvements, increased submissions, increased citations and even subscription growth for the printed versions of their publications.\u2021 It is significant that in 2008 the BMJ Group, which experimented with full open access and then reverted to toll access for non-research articles for BMJ, \u201cextended its open access experiment by introducing BMJ Unlocked (http://adc.bmj.com/info/unlocked.dtl), which allows authors submitting research to any of the group\u2019s 19 specialist research journals to pay an author fee in order to make their work open access.\u201d19",

The main journals publishing high-energy physics research have seen no adverse effect from the widespread use by the physics community of the open access arXiv repository.23 Similarly, in India, the Medknow publisher of biomedical journals reports an increase in subscriptions since the online versions of the journals were made available on an open access basis (Figure 5). Moreover, the quality of local journals has improved as a result of increased visibility, with increases in submissions, impact factor and international contributors being recorded.24",

And although 55.6% of the downloads from the total 18-month period originated from within Venezuela or the university itself, 30.4% were from neighbouring Latin and South American countries, and 7.3%, or over 138,000, were from countries from around the world, including both remote developing countries and countries in Europe and North America (the origin of 6.7% of the downloads could not be identified).\u00a7 These figures mirror those recorded by other IRs and, even taking into account the limitations of interpreting web statistics, show a significant and increasing sharing of information.",
