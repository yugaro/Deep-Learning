            "text": "The S (spike, or E2 glycoprotein precursor) protein is the largest structural protein of Type I membrane glycoproteins and is the main component of the characteristic spikes on the surface of coronaviruses. It is composed of a knob region (S1) and a stem region (S2), and in some species of coronaviruses the precursor S protein will be cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 glycopolypeptides at a special protease cleavage site 1., 2., 3., 4.. The S protein is postulated to be incorporated into the viral membrane by interaction with the M (membrane) protein, and subsequent release of mature virions from the smooth vesicles (5). The S protein is thought to be important for viral attachment through its interaction with the cellular receptors. Previous research has shown that the half of the S protein near the C-terminus is collapsed into coiled-coils, thus bringing a fusion peptide with the transmembrane (TM) region for cellular and viral membrane fusion 6., 7.. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the S protein induces the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies and that amino acid changes in the S protein may dramatically affect the virulence altered pathogenesis and in vitro host cell tropism in other coronaviruses 6., 8..",

We identified four coiled-coil-like motifs in the C-terminal region with high probability (Figure 1E). The TM region is hydrophobic and is composed of 23 a.a. (Codons 1,196\u20131,218; Figure 1F). The interior part has a low pI (pI 5.50) that is consistent with the hydrophilic environment in the area close to the membrane. It is also highly conserved and is rich of Cys residues (7/37). Interestingly, comparisons of different plots reveal the relationships among GC content, charge, hydrophobicity, helix, coil and TM, and makes it possible to divide the primary structure of the S protein into 31 sub-regions (Figure 1).",

This result is different from those proposed for the other structural proteins of SARS-CoV (11). To extend these earlier analyses by our group, a pairwise alignment was performed among the S protein of coronaviruses. The pairwise alignment yielded similar results to that of the unrooted tree (Table 3). Based on the similarity observed among the S proteins of 13 coronaviruses, we determined that the N-terminal half is highly variable while the C-terminal half is relatively conserved. Five more homologous regions, including the TM region, could be identified. (Figure 4)",

Vaccines for preventing coronavirus infections, such as those that have been developed for treating chicken bronchitis caused by AIBV, are not always effective due to mutation of the virus (15). Our similarity analysis showed that the S1 region, which is responsible for the attachment of the virus to cells, has undergone significant alteration (Figure 4). Our efforts to locate conservative exterior regions of the S protein revealed that the subregion at amino acid position 1,191\u20131,200 appears be the most conserved. There are no matches between this peptide and adjacent regions with the human protein database. Thus, this conserved region and the other less conserved regions may be important for designing sub-fractional natural vaccines or genetically engineered vaccines. We also identified four coiled-coil-like motifs in the C-terminal region with high probability (Figure 1E). Similar structures have been previously detected in some other coronaviruses (16). We believe that these regions are highly conserved and may be a potent drug target (17).",

After being washed with PBS containing 0.5 M Tween-20, BSA (2 mg/mL) was added and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for blocking. The patient serum sample (10 \u03bcL), diluted with 100 \u03bcL of sample buffer, was added into each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After being further washed with PBS-T, 100 \u03bcL mouse anti-human IgG was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. Finally, the wells were washed with PBS-T. The reaction was observed by adding the TMB solution as substrate, after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL 4 M sulphuric acid, and optical density at 450 nm (ref. 630 nm) was measured with an automatic ELISA reader (Multiskan Ascent, Finland).",

The glycosylation sites were predicted by NetNGlyc1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) and NetOGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/). The other modification sites of the S protein were predicted by Scanprosite (http://us.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/). The electric charge and hydropathicity analyses were performed by the software of charge (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS) and toppred (http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/toppred.html). The antigenic determinants were predicted by Antigenic (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS). The structural domains were predicted with InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/scan.html) and RPS_BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi). The signal peptide and TM region were predicted by SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The secondary structure was predicted by PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/psi-form.html) and COILS (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software). The phylogenetic analysis was performed with ClustalW1.8 (ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalW). The similarity among the coronaviruses was calculated and graphically represented by plotcon (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS) and dotmatcher (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS).
