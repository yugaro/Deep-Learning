However, in the case of our patient, a localized and slowly progressing pattern of DAD was observed. First, the patient was asymptomatic despite the organizing stage DAD shown in the chest radiographs. Second, a localized lesion was present in the LUL of the patient, an uncommon clinical pattern for which the rather new term \"regional alveolar damage (RAD)\" was coined3,4. Third, the etiology of the DAD in the case of this patient was unclear. AIP and AEIIP were known to be the common causes of idiopathic DAD. However, the clinical and radiological findings of this patient were not suggestive of either of the 2 diseases. AIP normally occurs as ARDS, and the most common type of AEIIP is acute exacerbation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AEIPF). The diagnostic criteria for AEIPF include: a previous history or diagnosis of IPF, occurrence and/or aggravation of dyspnea for a 30-day period before AEIPF can be diagnosed, newly occurring bilateral ground-glass opacity in the lungs confirmed by high-resolution CT of the chest, absence of pulmonary infection confirmed by BAL, and the absence of pulmonary thromboembolism and causes of acute lung injury1,5,6. High dose corticosteroid therapy has been a standard therapy for AIP and AEIPF, but its benefits are not clear, and the prognosis of this disease is poor7. Our case did not fall within the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AIP because the disease was localized and asymptomatic. We did not perform a biopsy in this case for AEIPF confirmation. However, even if the pathological diagnosis of IPF in the bilateral lower lobes were confirmed, the disease would not meet the diagnostic criteria for AEIPF, because it was localized and asymptomatic. Overall, the patient responded well to the steroid therapy. Fourth, the pulmonary lesion progressed unilaterally before the treatment. Therefore, the possibility of an early stage of AIP or AEIPF was low in this case.",
