A rhinosinusitis usually involves one or several paranasal sinuses. It might be confirmed by ultrasonography or as an opacification in X-ray investigation. According to the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS 2012) acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is defined \u2013 besides as an inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses \u2013 by two or more of the following characteristic symptoms: nasal congestion or secretion combined with facial pain or pressure or loss/reduction of smell [1]. Additional symptoms such as fever, fatigue or headache may occur.",

The demarcation of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis is mainly defined by length of the disease and not by specific symptoms. According to the definitions in EPOS 2012 an ARS is completely healed without remaining symptoms after 12 weeks, while in a chronic rhinosinusitis one or several symptoms still remain after that period. An acute viral rhinosinusitis lasts less than 10 days while an acute post-viral rhinosinusitis persists after 10 days. In the latter case there is often a biphasic symptom pattern with persisting or impairing symptoms by the end of the 10-day period.",

This drug is a standardized high-dosage product for the treatment of ARS. Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated in both in vitro and animal models that BNO 1016 has antimicrobial and antiviral effects including secretolytic and anti-inflammatory activities [6]. A previous phase 2b/3 study has documented positive efficacy and safety of BNO 1016 with a daily dose of 160 mg t.i.d. for 15 days [7]. This was confirmed in a subsequent confirmatory phase 3 trial [8].",
