            "text": "Picornaviruses, like other RNA viruses, synthesize dsRNA in an indispensable intermediate step of their replication process. These dsRNAs are detected by PKR to activate the ISR and limit the production of viral proteins. As a countermeasure, many viruses have evolved strategies to delay or suppress this antiviral response. We set out to test the ability of ISRIB to inhibit the ISR during infection with a recombinant encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) containing debilitating mutations in a zinc-finger domain of its Leader protein, the viral protein that serves as PKR antagonist (EMCV-LZn) (32, 33). To assess the effect of ISRIB on the ISR in virus-infected cells, we treated HeLa-R19 cells with ISRIB for 1 h from 5 h postinfection (p.i.) until 6 h p.i. and monitored active translation using a ribopuromycilation assay for 15 min at the 6-h time point p.i. (34). This time point is relatively late in the infection cycle, as a single round of replication of this virus takes only 6\u20138 h (Fig. 1A). Viral dsRNA replication intermediates are readily detected at \u223c4 h p.i. and reach a maximum level at \u223c6 h p.i. (Fig. 1B). As a positive control, we treated cells with 50 \u03bcM sodium arsenite, a commonly used method to trigger the ISR via HRI activation (35, 36). In both arsenite-treated and virus-infected cells, we observed eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and concomitant translational repression. Remarkably, ISRIB treatment failed to restore translation efficiency in infected cells, while translation in arsenite-treated cells was largely rescued (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells, suggesting that this effect was not cell-type specific (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We noted that the level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in virus-infected cells at 6 h p.i. was higher than in cells treated with 50 \u00b5M arsenite, suggesting a correlation between ISRIB\u2019s ability to inhibit the ISR and the extent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that ISRIB is only functional when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels are relatively low. To test this notion, we monitored the effects of ISRIB on SG formation in EMCV-LZn\u2013infected cells at earlier time points p.i., when smaller amounts of dsRNA were present. ISRIB suppressed SG formation at the earliest time point at which SGs were detected (4 h p.i.) but not later in infection (Fig. 2A), suggesting that ISRIB\u2019s ability to antagonize the ISR indeed depends on the concentration of the stress trigger. We next quantified intracellular P-eIF2\u03b1 levels by flow cytometry. Indeed, the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 in virus-infected cells increased gradually from 3 to 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2B), correlating with the timing of dsRNAs accumulation (Fig. 1B) and the appearance of SGs (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, our data indicated that a plateau level of P-eIF2\u03b1 was reached late in infection (5\u20136 h p.i.). To rule out that this observed maximum level of P-eIF2\u03b1 was caused by a detection limit of our flow cytometry approach, we compared flow cytometry (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A) and Western blotting (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) as readout methods for P-eIF2\u03b1 levels in cells stressed with increasing arsenite concentrations. The arsenite concentration at which the plateau level of P-eIF2\u03b1 level was reached (\u223c250 \u00b5M) was similar between the two detection methods. By comparing Western blot band intensity ratios of P-eIF2\u03b1 and (total) eIF2\u03b1 in cell lysates to those of purified eIF2\u03b1 samples containing known percentages of P-eIF2\u03b1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), we furthermore showed that this upper limit of P-eIF2\u03b1 levels (defined as 100% P-eIF2\u03b1) represents almost complete phosphorylation of the cellular eIF2\u03b1 pool. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the maximum level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation observed under harsh stress conditions represents the upper limit of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that was reached.",

Hence, we could not exclude that some virus-induced change(s) in one way or the other affected the ISRIB\u2019s ability to suppress the ISR in infected cells. To provide more direct support for the link between the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 and the ability of ISRIB to counteract the dsRNA-induced ISR, we next tested the efficacy of ISRIB in cells transfected with increasing concentrations of poly(I:C), a dsRNA mimic that\u2014like EMCV-LZn infection\u2014triggers the PKR branch of the ISR (Fig. 3). In the absence of ISRIB, we observed SG formation in cells transfected with 0.25 ng of poly(I:C) or more. ISRIB prevented SG formation only in cells transfected with relatively low poly(I:C) concentrations (1 ng or less) but not when larger amounts of poly(I:C) were used (Fig. 3A). At the highest concentration of poly(I:C) at which ISRIB could counteract the ISR (i.e., 1 ng), the P-eIF2\u03b1 level was \u223c45% of the maximum (Fig. 3B). Transfection of 2 ng of poly(I:C) induced >70% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 concentration and rendered ISRIB ineffective. Together, these data suggest that a threshold level of P-eIF2\u03b1 exists in the range of 45\u201370% of the maximum, above which ISRIB can no longer antagonize the ISR.",

Since ISRIB acts downstream of P-eIF2\u03b1, we expected similar results irrespective of which stress sensor was activated. To provide further support for this notion, we used multiple arsenite concentrations to induce HRI-mediated ISR activation. Again, we correlated the ability of ISRIB to counteract SG formation (Fig. 4A) to P-eIF2\u03b1 levels (Fig. 4B). In the absence of ISRIB, SG formation was observed in cells treated with 50 \u00b5M arsenite or more. The presence of ISRIB increased the arsenite concentration required to induce SG formation to 200 \u00b5M or more (Fig. 4A). The highest arsenite concentration at which ISRIB blocked SG formation (100 \u00b5M) resulted in \u223c40% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level. At 200 \u00b5M arsenite, which induced \u223c75% P-eIF2\u03b1, ISRIB showed no effect. Importantly, the P-eIF2\u03b1 threshold level above which ISRIB no longer antagonized the ISR (between 40% and 70%) was similar to that observed in poly(I:C)-transfected cells (i.e., between 45% and 70%).",

By analyzing translation efficiency and stress granule formation in HeLa or U2OS cells infected with a recombinant picornavirus lacking its PKR antagonist, we showed that ISRIB inhibited the ISR early in infection, when levels of viral dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 were relatively low, but not at later time points when levels of dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 were high. To extend this observation, we performed a detailed analysis of the P-eIF2\u03b1 levels and the ability of ISRIB to inhibit the ISR upon treatment of HeLa cells with varying concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite. We found that the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 correlated with the concentration of stress trigger used but reached a plateau under severe stress conditions. Thus, the extent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is graduated, quantitatively reflecting the severity of the stress situation. Importantly, the P-eIF2\u03b1 concentration continued to increase even beyond the concentration necessary to suppress protein synthesis. Irrespective of the stress inducer used, ISRIB antagonized the ISR only when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels were below a critical threshold. This threshold was determined to be somewhere between 45% and 70% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level that could be observed in HeLa cells and was similar in cells infected with virus, transfected with poly(I:C), or treated with arsenite. Using an ATF4 reporter cell line, we also showed that ISRIB failed to block the expression of stress-induced proteins in the presence of high intracellular P-eIF2\u03b1 levels. Taken together, our data show that ISRIB is effective only under conditions of limited stress.",

In reticulocyte lysates, translation initiation was suppressed when the fraction of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 was increased from \u223c10% under basal conditions to 20\u201340% (38). In line with these data, our results show that only \u223c20% of the maximum level of P-eIF2\u03b1 is sufficient to block translation and induce the formation of SGs in living cells. In the presence of ISRIB, this threshold level of P-eIF2\u03b1 was increased to 45\u201370% of the maximum. Importantly, this threshold level of P-eIF2\u03b1 appeared independent of the stress trigger, and hence of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase involved. These data are in line with published in vitro data showing that ISRIB increased the GEF activity of eIF2B in the presence of P-eIF2, but failed to do so when the P-eIF2:eIF2 ratio was increased further (24). Taken together, the data from these in vitro GEF assays and our data from assays in live cells suggest that ISRIB desensitizes cells to P-eIF2\u03b1, unless the P-eIF2\u03b1 concentration exceeds a critical threshold level.",

The resulting octamers contain an interface for association of an eIF2B\u03b1 dimer (25). Since eIF2B\u03b1 is essential for P-eIF2\u2019s ability to inhibit eIF2B (39), P-eIF2 likely binds only the full eIF2B decamer, not its subcomplexes. Thereby, P-eIF2 likely promotes eIF2B decamer formation and mediates sequestration of eIF2B subcomplexes into inactive P-eIF2\u2022eIF2B complexes. Consequently, high P-eIF2 concentrations may deplete the cytoplasmic pools of eIF2B building blocks. This provides a plausible explanation for ISRIB\u2019s lack of effect in the presence of high P-eIF2 levels, since the absence of eIF2B subcomplexes prevents ISRIB from assembling active eIF2B decamers.",

It is unclear to what extent these treatments reflect physiologically relevant stress situations. In this study, we used a virus lacking its PKR antagonist to assess the ability of ISRIB to antagonize the ISR induced by a viral stress trigger (i.e., viral dsRNA) with natural intracellular localization and in physiological quantities. We showed that ISRIB inhibits the ISR early in infection, when little viral dsRNA has been produced and P-eIF2\u03b1 levels are relatively low, but not late in infection, when viral dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 levels are high.

            "text": "While the ISR protects cells from stressful situations, dysregulated ISR signaling may have pathological consequences in vivo, and may be involved in the presentation of cognitive defects in neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, amylotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and prion diseases (40\u201344). ISRIB provided significant beneficial effects in a mouse model of prion disease, and it also reversed neurological damage caused by traumatic brain injury (21), all without exhibiting overt toxic side effects (27, 45). By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of PERK caused pancreatic toxicity in mice, and knockdown of PKR had an aberrant effect on cytokinesis (15, 28). Paradoxically, ISRIB did not display such adverse side effects in vivo (27). Our observation that ISRIB is functional only within a narrow range of P-eIF2\u03b1 levels resolves this paradox. According to this notion, ISRIB does not negatively affect high(er) P-eIF2\u03b1 levels that may be relevant for certain stages during cell growth or proliferation. The fact that ISRIB has beneficial effects in vivo against several neurological disorders and other stress-induced pathologies suggests that P-eIF2\u03b1 levels would be relatively modest under these conditions. These considerations stress the importance to obtain quantitative data on how much eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation occurs in neurological disorders. More insight into levels of eIF2B, eIF2, and P-eIF2\u03b1 and the assembly state of these multiprotein complexes in different cell/tissue types exposed to different stress and disease conditions will be invaluable to predict and/or evaluate effects of ISRIB treatment.",
