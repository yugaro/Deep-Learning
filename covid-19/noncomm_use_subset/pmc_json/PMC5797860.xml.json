            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated progressive systemic infectious disease that occurs in domestic cats and wild felids, and is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), a single-stranded RNA virus. FCoV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and usually causes mild to inapparent enteritis, and FIP is considered to be induced by a virulent mutant of the enteric FCoV [16, 22]. It is divided into 2 clinical forms, effusive FIP, in which effusion is observed in body cavities, and non-effusive FIP [1, 2]. Non-effusive FIP lacks specific clinical signs, with lesions presented mainly in the eyes, central nervous system (CNS), and parenchymatous organs. Clinical signs associated with CNS disease in cases of FIP are observed in about 10% of all FIP cases and 25\u201333% of non-effusive FIP cases [1, 2, 9]. Recently, image diagnosis is often performed especially for neurological instances in veterinary medical field, and CSF sample can be collected at that time. Detection of FCoV-specific antibody in CSF, which is produced by local replication of FCoV in brain tissue, is useful for the ante-mortem diagnosis of neurologic-form FIP [9]. Several studies have reported the anti-FCoV antibody titers in CSF, but the number of clinical cases reported is small, and no diagnostic index of FIP has been proposed [4, 10, 20].",

All samples were stored at \u221235\u00b0C prior to testing. The antibody titers were performed employing an indirect fluorescent antibody method [15, 17]. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells were infected with FIP virus strain 79-1146 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.) in a 96-well tissue culture plate and allowed to incubate for 20 hr, then the plate was fixed with a methanol-acetone solution, with CSF and serum samples subjected to 2-fold serial dilutions started at 1:10 and 1:80, respectively. Following incubation, the plate was washed and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-cat IgG goat antibody (Cappel, Cochranville, PA, U.S.A.) was added to each well. After a second incubation period, the plate was washed and examined with a fluorescent microscope, and the antibody titer noted was expressed as the highest sample dilution with a positive reaction. In addition, CSF samples from 24 CSF antibody-positive and 21 CSF antibody negative cats were subjected to FCoV RT-PCR using the P205-P211 primer pair [13, 18] for definitive diagnosis of FIP, as the demonstration of FCoV RNA in CSF is highly suggestive of FIP [1, 8].",

CSF FCoV RNA was detected in all of 11 Group B cats in which RT-PCR assay was performed. It is considered that when FCoV RNA is detected in CSF, that animal is very likely to have FIP [1, 8]. Furthermore, the S/C of Group B cats (8 or lower) was markedly lower than normal range (256\u20132,048) [5, 11, 21]. Based on above findings, we propose that a CSF antibody titer of 1:640 or higher is served as a candidate for the index of FIP diagnosis. Our results would suggest that FIP may be able to be often diagnosed by an antibody test, which allows relatively stable measurement, without genetic examinations such as RT-PCR, in which the contamination of amplicon and ribonuclease to a test sample can lead to any erroneous test result, and expensive equipment and a high level skill are required for performance.",

In this study, the RNA was detected in two Group A cats, even though the CSF antibody titer was low (1:10 and 1:20). These cases may have been at an early stage of neurologic-form FIP. Furthermore, no cases with CSF antibodies at titers of 1:160 and 1:320 were detected in this study, and we could not verify a relationship between the antibody titers and FIP in these cases. These findings suggest that the index proposed in this study may have a low negative predictive value for diagnosis of FIP.
