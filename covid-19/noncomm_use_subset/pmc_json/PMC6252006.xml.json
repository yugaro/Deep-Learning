MERS is responsible for the death of more than 587 people all over the world from 2012 to 2015 (MOH, 2015). First and the highest number of cases are reported from Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012). Now in 24 countries MERS cases are reported (Bermingham et al., 2012), in which Middle East countries are on the top. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. Betacoronaviruses are further divided into four genetic clades, clade a to clade d (Gorbalenya et al., 2004). MERS-CoV belongs to Betacoronavirus clade c. The other virus of this family is responsible for common cold except SARS, which is responsible for the death of more than 8400 cases and 800 deaths (World Health Organization, 2014).",
