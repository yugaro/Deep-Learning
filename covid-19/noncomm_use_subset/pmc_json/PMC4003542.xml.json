All those changes will gradually result in loss of lung function and, ultimately, respiratory failure. IPF is an age-related disease with a poor prognosis, and the median survival of IPF patients from disease diagnosis to death is usually no more than 3 years 2. The exact etiology of IPF is still unclear and there are limited proven treatment options. Current therapies such as anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anti-fibrotic methods showed no promising results to halt the progression of the disease or to improve the quality of life 3. Therefore, it is urgent to further investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms and explore novel therapeutic strategies for treating PF.",

After cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin (ANG) I turns into ANG II. The activated ANG II answers for up-regulating transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) which is pivotal in modulating the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblasts 6. Moreover, ANG II is also believed to associate with inflammatory responses and cell apoptosis during the progress of various lung diseases 7, 8. Recent discovery of a homologue of ACE, named ACE-2, and its enzymatic product ANG-(1-7) could counter the detrimental effects of ACE and offer beneficial effects by limiting ANGII accumulation during kinds of pathophysiological processes 9-11. Studies also demonstrated that ACE-2/ANGA (1-7) plays a key negative regulatory factor for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure 12, 13. Recently, the protective effects of ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) during the progression of PF were increasingly being investigated 14-16.",

Aiming to evaluate the collagen and fibrosis changes during PF, a modified picrosirius procedure based on the classic sirius red staining was performed 19, 20. In brief, after regular deparaffinization and rehydration, the lung specimens were immersed in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for 5 min and then covered with 0.1% (w/v) sirius red F3B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saturated picric acid solution for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were mounted after being dehydrated and cleared in xylene. The specimens were analyzed by using a light microscope (Olympus BX50, Tokyo, Japan) under normal and polarized light obtained with polarizing filters (Olympus U-ANT, Tokyo, Japan) in order to analyze the initial collagen organization and then the fibrosis. The lung alveolar inflammation and PF were scaled by the HE staining and the Trichrome Masson's staining as described by the previous study of Szapiel 21. Three independent pathologists undertook the histological examination and applied the scoring system in a blinded fashion.",

With further understanding of this disease, recent aims for treating PF have shifted from reversing the development to slowing or halting the progression of this chronic fibrotic disease 23. As is well known that TGF-\u03b21 is amplified after lung injury, and plays a key promoter involved in the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, transformation of epithelial cells into myofbroblasts (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), protection of myofbroblasts from apoptosis, and accumulation of collagen during the progression of PF 24. Studies have demonstrated increased TGF-\u03b21 levels in lungs after BLM exposure 25, 26. A monoclonal antibody has been demonstrated to be effective in blocking murine fibrosis by partial inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 without exacerbating inflammation 27. Gene therapy methods have revealed more choices for attenuating fibrogenesis by direct or indirect blocking TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway 28, 29. In the present study, endotracheal instillation of BLM induced a severe PF together with a dramatic increase of TGF-\u03b21 expression, demonstrated as accumulation of interstitial lung collagen. Collagen deposition was obviously decreased by TIIA treatment. In line with these studies, we also observed increased lung mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 after BLM instillation, which was significantly reduced by TIIA treatment.",

Despite the similar functions as ACE, ACE-2 has different substrates 30, 31. Previous studies revealed that ACE-2 may negatively regulate the RAS, and counterbalance the functions of ACE 32. Another study also demonstrates ACE-2 plays a negative regulatory role for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure 13. Moreover, decreased pulmonary ACE-2 activity related with BLM induced lung injury has been reported in both animal and human studies 15, 33. Our study showed that BLM induced decreased ACE-2 levels in rat lungs, which is consistent with the previous studies. Moreover, TIIA treatment reversed the lowered expression of ACE-2 levels both by immunohistochemical and WB assays. Additionally, the mRNA levels of ACE-2 were also significantly lowered after BLM exposure, which is also in agreement with the study mentioned above.",
