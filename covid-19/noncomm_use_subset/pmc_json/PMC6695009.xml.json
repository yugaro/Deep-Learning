Moreover, the mode of transmission of the MERS-CoV in humans is not fully understood. Knowing the mode of transmission is essential to reducing the threat of transmission and to developing effective control measures. Upon the initial appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, during the coronavirus (SARS-CoV) endemic between 2002 and 2003, the phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV from the patients from several terrestrial areas was vital for understanding the viral development and the level of the disease.5 Molecular analysis supported the proposition that the SARS-CoV perhaps initiated in bats and was then transmitted to humans. The results from linking the genetic relationship between the SARS-CoV in humans and in civets has shown a cross-host evolution.6",

After three days of investigations, a nasal swab had been taken for a molecular diagnostic panel of respiratory pathogens. The samples were transported to the laboratory using full precautions. A variety of laboratory molecular tests were performed including influenza A and B and MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. According to the laboratory, the samples were processed to extract the viral RNA using a fully automated machine (Roche MagNa Pure LC (RNA Viral isolation Kit; The MagNA Pure System, version 1.0)). Following that, the extracted RNA was loaded on a 96 well plate after preparation of the master mix and the addition of the internal controls (Tib Molbiol Primers and Probes with Roche Master Mix). Next, the plate was placed into the Light Cycler 480 (Roche) for the amplification and determination of the results. The laboratory report confirmed that the samples were positive for MERS-CoV.",

How the MERS-CoV transmits is unfortunately a mystery, but it is presumed to involve the direct interaction with the mucus secretion (saliva) of diseased camels or via the intake of milk or perhaps the uncooked meat. Nevertheless, it is not yet confirmed whether there is another transitional host for the MERS-CoV transmission to humans or not.12 A secondary infection could occur by droplets, and the virus could possibly spread either via air or fomites.13",
