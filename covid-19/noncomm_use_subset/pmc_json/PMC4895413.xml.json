Sample size calculation was performed using methods for calculating sample size for 2 independent groups8 based on a standard deviation of 207 mg/dL for serum IgG concentrations in calves given plasma IV in previous studies4 (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, minimal detectable IgG concentration = 196 mg/dL). The required sample size was at least 7 calves in each group. To account for an anticipated dropout of up to 50% because of mortality, 30 calves (15 in each group) were enrolled. Thirty Jersey bull calves from a single farm in Hilmar, California were enrolled. Adult cows on the farm of study were vaccinated annually with a modified live respiratory disease vaccine containing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea, parainfluenza\u20103, and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses. Additionally, the cows were vaccinated with a multivalent vaccine containing Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus during the dry cow period. Jersey bull calves delivered from eutocia and observed births were immediately separated from their dams before nursing colostrum. The calves were randomly assigned using a coin toss to 2 groups. Fifteen calves were assigned to the control group to receive colostrum (CL group) by oroesopheagal tubing, and 15 to the treatment group (PL group) to receive bovine plasma IV. The calves were weighed, identified using ear tags, transported within 36 h after enrollment and housed in individual calf hutches at the UC Davis Beef Research facilities.",

An aliquot (5 mL) of colostrum or plasma to be administered was collected before administration for IgG concentration determination. Plasma was administered through the jugular vein using an aseptically placed intravenous catheter1 at a dosage of 34 mL/kg. Infusion of plasma was performed at a rate of 10 mL/kg/h over the first 20 min. Monitoring for transfusion reactions included monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, mucous membranes color, and abnormal behavior. In the absence of an immediate transfusion reaction, the remainder of the plasma was transfused over 20\u201330 min. In the event of a plasma transfusion reaction, transfusion was discontinued for 10 min and resumed at 5 mL/kg/h. Calves enrolled in the CL group received 3 L of pooled, pasteurized colostrum, from 1 batch collected from the farm of study, through an oroesophageal tube, once. Colostrum was pasteurized at 60\u00b0C for min using a batch pasteurizer. All calves received colostrum or bovine plasma within 2 h after birth. Thereafter, all calves were fed 2 L of nonmedicated milk replacer2 twice daily, 0.5 kg of nonmedicated commercial concentrate feed twice daily and water was available ad libitum. Calves were monitored 3 times daily. Daily calf monitoring procedures by trained personnel included assessment of rectal temperature, appetite for milk replacer, and concentrate feed and evidence of diarrhea or coughing. Decisions to medically treat calves were made by a UC Davis campus licensed veterinarian and not by the investigators.

Although the median serum IgG concentration reached concentrations consistent with adequate transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentrations \u22651,000 mg/dL) at 6 h after plasma transfusion, the concentrations were not maintained beyond 6 h. The half\u2010life of plasma derived IgG was only 4.4 d compared to 17.1 d for colostral derived IgG. The median IgG concentrations indicative of FPI after 6 h and the short half\u2010life of plasma derived IgG in the PL group indicated that the rate of catabolism of plasma derived IgG was higher compared to colostral derived IgG. Calves in the CL group maintained serum IgG concentrations consistent with adequate transfer of immunity during the 7\u2010d study period. Fecal IgG concentrations were not different between the 2 groups except at 5 d of age when the CL group had higher fecal concentrations. Thus, fecal IgG concentration did not explain the fate of the rapidly decreasing serum IgG in the PL group. There are 2 possible explanations for the insignificant differences in the fecal IgG concentrations between the 2 groups before 5 d of age. First, results of studies in human patients with active or benign inflammatory bowel diseases15 and clinical healthy dogs9 suggested that fecal immunoglobulin determinations tests were less reliable because of lower detection rates (<0.01 to 35.5%). In the study in humans with active or benign inflammatory bowel disease, complete intestinal lavage was recommended for detection of fecal IgG.15 Secondly, detection of IgG by SRID is based on the binding of the IgG molecule to the anti\u2010bovine IgG in the agarose gel.16 Consequently, destruction of the IgG binding site during preparation of fecal samples for IgG determination will result in lower detection rates of fecal IgG. The physiological mechanism resulting in increased catabolism of plasma derived IgG may be similar to the mechanism suggested studies of humans.7 The studies7 indicated that IgG aggregates formed during plasma preparation might activate complement after transfusion resulting in increased catabolism of IgG.",

Consequently, a lower bovine plasma dosage may be preferred in calves given plasma. Thus, it is important to consider the higher dosage rates (30\u201340 mL/kg) to successfully increase serum IgG concentration to those consistent with adequate transfer of immunity. Furthermore, the rapid decrease in serum IgG concentration after plasma transfusion may warrant repeated transfusion within 12 h when necessary to maintain serum IgG concentrations consistent with adequate transfer of immunity. However, repeated plasma transfusions may predispose to transfusion reactions. Serum total protein concentration was an inconsistent test in classifying calves with FPI after transfusion. This is because median serum total protein concentrations \u22655.2 g/dL at 48 h of age achieved by the PL group calves are considered indicative of adequate transfer of immunity.1 In contrast, all calves in the PL group had serum IgG concentrations consistent with FPI based on the reference method (SRID).",

However, the colostral derived IgG half\u2010life also is shorter in comparison to other studies.4 Additionally, the half\u2010life for plasma derived IgG reported in this study was substantially shorter than the 27.3 d reported in previous studies.4 Two possible reasons might account for the differences in the results. First, serum IgG determination was only performed 48 h after colostrum or plasma administration in the other studies.4 Considering that a significant decrease in serum IgG concentration occurred during the first 12 h after plasma transfusion and a significant increase in serum IgG concentrations occurred before 48 h in the CL group (Table 2) in this study, the estimation of IgG half\u2010life potentially was affected by the study design. The second potential explanation for the differences in the half\u2010life of colostral or plasma derived IgG between the studies was the duration of the follow\u2010up period. The study period reported here was 7 d compared to 35 d in a previous study.4 We chose to collect samples only up to 7 d because antibodies to different bacterial, protozoal, and viral antigens do not appear in blood before 14\u201330 d of age.18, 19 Thus, we chose a time period before the expected appearance of endogenously synthesized immunoglobulins to minimize effects on serum IgG half\u2010life determination. Mortality rates in the PL group were significantly high compared to the CL group consistent with previous studies4 indicating that plasma is unlikely to provide protective immunity comparable to maternal colostrum. Based on survival analysis, calves in the PL group were 5 times (hazard ratio, 5.01) more likely to experience mortality compared to those in the CL group. Based on logistic regression analysis, PL group calves that received treatments were 1.4 times more likely to experience mortality (relative risk, 1.4) compared to the PL group calves that received treatment.",

In clinical practice, calves that experience FPI and are transfused with bovine plasma are likely to have been fed insufficient colostrum rather than no colostrum. The PL group calves in this study were colostrum deprived. In addition to immunoglobulins, colostrum contains maternally derived immunoreactive cells, which stimulate the calf's immune system.20 Thus, the effects of administration of plasma on serum IgG concentrations and immunoreactive cells in calves that experience FPI caused by insufficient colostrum ingestion warrant further investigation. Furthermore, the majority of calves for which plasma administration is recommended are more likely to be clinically sick. In contrast, calves were considered clinically healthy at the time of plasma administration in this study. Studies evaluating effect of plasma administration on serum IgG concentration in sick neonatal calves are recommended.",
