A few materials self-identified as testing health security or testing for contingency, and so warranted extra categories. The materials identified looked at aspects of health security across different geographical levels (international, national, regional and facility); they more frequently examined the regional/district (43%) and facility levels (31.4%) (figure 3).

Similarly, the approach to the analyses conducted required sufficient detail in the identified materials in relation to exercises or objectives, which led to the exclusion of a number of relevant materials as they were not present either with sufficient details or as a package (written narrative, scenario, injects and postexercise report). Both the academic literature and institutional materials were analysed using the same approach. This likely led to an underestimation of effect in relation to academic literature as not all that was tested may have been reported, and an overestimation in relation to institutional materials as objectives may not have been applied effectively within exercises.",
