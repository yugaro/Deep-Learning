When the pressure is too low, the patient risks inhaling the accumulated subglottic secretions from the oropharynx, which is known to play a major role in VAP incidence.14 15 Alternatively, if the pressure is too high there is a risk of ischaemia of the tracheal mucosa and, at removal, of tracheal oedema and later tracheal stenosis. Therefore, regular monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure is recommended, but the optimal monitoring frequency has yet to be clearly determined. Underinflation and/or overinflation of the tracheal cuff often occurs in ventilated patients under intermittent manual control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manometer, which is a well-known source of morbidity and mortality.23 Recently published data favour use of automatic devices that are able to continuously regulate the tracheal cuff pressure.24\u201331 Even though several learned societies do not recommend their implementation for the purpose of VAP prevention in ventilated patients, recent findings in the literature tend to favour their use.24 25 27 29 32 However, these studies have several limitations, as all were monocentre studies that included a relatively small number of participants, which rarely included severe trauma patients even though they are at greatest risk for VAP, and these studies did not systematically apply other recommended VAP preventive measures, with a contestable choice for the main study end point.",

The following criteria will be applied to all patients and controlled throughout the duration of the study.Monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure of the tracheal tube either once every 8 hours in the control group or continuously in the intervention group through the use of a pneumatic device (Nosten), with the objective of maintaining pressure between 25 and 30 cm H2O.Implementation of identical sedation and weaning protocols for all centres.Implementation of a lung protective ventilation strategy34 by maintaining a tidal volume of 6\u20138 mL/kg of ideal body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure >3 cm H2O and respiratory rate set to achieve normocapnia or optional moderate hypocapnia.According to the protocol observed in the unit, extubation should be considered as soon as: (1) the patient\u2019s Glasgow Coma Scale is >10; (2) the patient is coughing spontaneously or secondary to bronchial aspiration and (3) the level of pressure support is <10 cm H2O, or spontaneous ventilation on a T-piece with FiO2 lower than 40% is tolerated by the patient for at least 30 min.No systematic changes to the respirator circuits.Preferential use of heat and humidity exchange filters to be changed only when soiled.Systematic application of bed inclination of at least 30\u00b0 to be monitored every 4 hours.Hand washing (hydroalcoholic friction) prior to any treatment and following isolation measures.Mouth care every 4\u20138 hours according to the protocol observed in the unit.Tracheal aspiration carried out using sterile equipment, only to be performed when required.Preferential oral insertion of feeding tubes.Starting enteral feeding as soon as possible.Systematic application of a glucose monitoring protocol in which the patient\u2019s blood sugar level is measured every 4 hours, the objective being to maintain the glucose level between 4 and 8 mmol/L.Prophylactic antibiotic treatment limited to 48 hours for fractures operated within the first 6 hours.Curative antibiotic therapy reserved for infections for which the bacterial origin is documented, or probable, and in cases where other anti-infectious measures are insufficient, in accordance with the 2008 recommendations of the official French health authority on the proper use of antibiotics.35 An adequate dosage regimen and method of antibiotic administration is provided to ensure an optimal concentration at the site of infection. Recourse to serum assay is useful whenever possible to avoid underdosing, which is a common cause of failure, as well as to avoid overdosing, which leads to iatrogenic pathologies. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred. In cases of severe infection, antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible following diagnostics and microbiological sampling, and started no later than the first hour in cases of septic shock. The duration of VAP treatment should be limited to 1 week, except in cases with non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterial infections for which antibiotic therapy should continue for 2 weeks to reduce the risk of recurrence. Antibiotic associations are strictly limited to precisely defined situations: the need to broaden the antibacterial spectrum; severe and microbiologically undocumented infections; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and bacteria and antibiotic combinations associated with a high risk of resistance emergence. These include group 3 Enterobacteriaceae (eg, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia and Morganella) and third-generation cephalosporins; Staphylococcus aureus and fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, fusidic acid or fosfomycin and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic therapy should be re-evaluated between 24 and 72 hours.Prevention of ulcer disease by anti-H2 and proton pump inhibitors, in accordance with the protocol observed in the centre.",

We will also record VAE according to the CDC criteria,36 and compare the ATS and CDC definitions for VAP as a secondary objective.
