These TEM parts, manufactured by the British company Metropolitan\u2010Vickers, were purchased and hastily left behind by the fleeing Kuomintang government on its way to Taiwan. Professor Tsien was so excited about the serendipitous finding that he immediately decided to assemble the microscope despite lack of an installation handbook. In no more than 4 years, he and his co\u2010workers published the first electron microscopy (EM) research article in China,1 in which they described the fine structural defects of aluminum foil. This article marked the beginning of an era in China that relied on EM to examine the world at nanoscale. Application of EM soon became popular in China, especially due to its powerful utility in the characterization of inorganic materials for the steel and engineering industry.",

China was apparently unprepared for such a traumatic experience as the general public deserted shops and avoided gathering. During the process of identifying the disease causing agent and clinical treatment, the Chinese government keenly realized the importance of basic research in biology and medicine. In 2005, Zihe Rao (), then Director of the IBP, and Fuchu He (), then Vice\u2010President of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences (CAMMS) successfully lobbied the government to invest on basic research through construction of a centralized biological research facility. The Chinese Commission of Development and Reform, a de facto funding agency, decided to allocate 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan (about 130 million US Dollars then) on a National Protein Science Facility (the Facility). The original idea was to build a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art facility at IBP of CAS in Beijing, which scientists from China and all over the world would use for their cutting\u2010edge research. Due to the construction of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and other reasons, the leadership of CAS changed their mind in 2006 and proposed to build the Facility in Shanghai instead of Beijing. This change caused an uproar among scientists in Beijing, particularly those at CAMMS and Tsinghua.",

Together, Wang and Shi convinced the administration of Tsinghua University about the importance of retaining the Facility in Beijing, perhaps to a location conveniently accessible by scientists from Zhongguancun () and neighboring institutions. With strong support from the Ministry of Education and Beijing municipal government, Tsinghua University formed an alliance with CAMMS to compete with CAS for the right to build the Facility in Beijing instead of Shanghai. After several rounds of discussion, the final outcome was a compromised solution: the Chinese Commission of Development and Reform decided to split the funds evenly between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS in 2008. CAS would spend its share of 550 million Yuan on a facility in Shanghai (Shanghai Facility), located next to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in the Pudong District. The Shanghai Facility received an additional allocation of approximately 200 million Yuan from the local government.",

            "text": "The decision to split the Facility between two distant locations proved to be correct, because scientists in each location faced the competitive pressure to achieve higher scientific productivity and originality. In addition, the local governments competed to provide more financial support. The Beijing municipal government was more generous, providing 1:1 matching funds to the allotment from the central government and making the total investment 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan. Once the solution was reached between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS, Peking University and IBP asked to have a share of the Beijing Facility. It took some time for all parties to agree to a negotiated consensus. In the end, CAMMS had half of the total funds, with Tsinghua and Peking Universities splitting the remaining half. Despite its affiliation with CAS, IBP also received a small share of the funds that were earmarked for research instrument development. In the end, the Beijing Facility, also known as the Pilot Hub of Encyclopedic ProteomIX (PHOENIX), consists of three sites: a main location at CAMMS that focuses on proteomics, an arm on biological EM at Tsinghua, and a second arm on biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at Peking University. Binglin Gu (), a former President of Tsinghua University, vividly described the Beijing Facility as \u201cone body and two wings,\u201d or \u201c,\u201d where the body refers to CAMMS and two wings Tsinghua and Peking Universities.",

At the beginning of the millennium, hard X\u2010ray free\u2010electron laser (XFEL) technology began to show promise as a powerful tool for structural elucidation of macromolecules. A large number of scientists from several disciplines had been lobbying the Chinese government for the construction of a national XFEL facility. Unfortunately, even under optimal circumstances, such an XFEL facility would be completed for operation no earlier than the year 2025 and thus offered little help to the ever\u2010increasing demands of structural biologists in China. Nonetheless, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility\u2014a third\u2010generation light source\u2014was under construction in 2006, and Peking University had already built a national NMR facility with support from several branches of the central government. Thus, despite booming structural biology in China, complete absence of any high\u2010end TEM with field\u2010emission gun (FEG) for biological EM in 2007 formed a sharp contrast to the other two major methods of structure determination. Importantly, EM\u2010based methodologies\u2014including single\u2010particle cryo\u2010EM, cryo\u2010electron tomography (cryo\u2010ET), and electron crystallography\u2014had begun to show remarkable potential. In early 2007, a consensus was quickly reached among key scientists at Tsinghua\u2014particularly Shi, Sui, and Wang\u2014to build a centralized EM facility at Tsinghua. The University administration fully supported the decision. On behalf of Tsinghua, Sui delivered a proposal for such a facility to members of a review panel in May 2007.",

The possibility of installing Asia's first operational Titan Krios on Tsinghua campus and the huge research potential convinced the leadership, which decided to make an investment of 30 million Yuan after listening to a brief presentation by Shi. These funds were supposed to cover both the purchase, room preparation, and the operation of the Titan microscope. Facing a gap of funds, Shi et al. had to negotiate with FEI to lower the purchase price. Gratifyingly, within 2 weeks of the very first meeting with the FEI team, Shi signed a formal Titan Krios purchasing contract on behalf of Tsinghua University in June 2008.

Recognition of bacterial pathogens by NLR apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) induces activation of NLR family CARD domain\u2010containing protein 4 (NLRC4) followed by formation of the NAIP\u2010NLRC4 inflammasomes.31, 32 Recent cryo\u2010EM studies33, 34 of the mouse Naip2\u2010Nlrc4 inflammasome provide the first view of how inflammasomes are assembled and activated (Table 2). In the cryo\u2010EM structures, the complex formed a wheel\u2010like architecture containing 10 or 11 Nlrc4 protomers; however, only one Naip2 molecule was incorporated into the complex. Structural comparison between an inactive Nlrc435 and the activated Nlrc4 suggests a model for the activation of the Naip2\u2010Nlrc4 inflammasome, in which Nlrc4, once activated by Naip2, exposes a previously hidden surface for interaction with a solvent\u2010exposed receptor surface of an inactive Nlrc4, leading to Nlrc4 self\u2010activation.",
