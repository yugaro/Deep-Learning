As such, viral culture has a limited place in routine diagnostic microbiology, although these assays must still be considered in reference or research laboratories. For rhinoviruses, there are also additional limitations related to the number of serotypes circulating and the lack of broad detection tools, as each serotype is only recognized by specific antibodies. Most PCR protocols that detect rhinovirus amplify a fragment of the 5' UTR (Untraslated region) of the viral genome. This region is highly conserved among picornaviruses. These assays provide high sensitivity, but because the gene sequences are similar between rhinovirus and other enterovirus species, the assays also necessitate an additional step to differentiate the two. Examples of other methods to detect these viruses include hybridization with specific probes (4, 17), nested-PCR with specific HRV primers (1), and duplex nested-PCR with enterovirus and rhinovirus primers that distinguish between enterovirus- and rhinovirus-positive samples in only one reaction (2). Moreover, sequencing can distinguish these viruses following their detection (14).",

Analysis of the results obtained after the first two strategies revealed 83% concordance involving 60 positive results and 180 negative results. Fifty-one samples had discordant detection between these protocols. Of these samples, 45 could be evaluated by a third protocol. These selected samples included 29 samples that were rhinovirus- positive by RT-PCR hybridization but negative by RT-PCR sequencing and 16 samples that were rhinovirus-negative on RT-PCR hybridization but positive on RT-PCR sequencing. Duplex semi-nested RT-PCR on these 45 samples indicated that 6 were rhinovirus, 2 were enterovirus, and 37 were negative. Of the 37 negative samples, 28 were previously negative by RT-PCR sequencing, and the other nine were previously negative with RT-PCR hybridization.

Several studies have discussed the HRV and HEV similarity and identity at the genetic and amino acid levels (3, 8, 23). Recently, these two different viral species were grouped into the same Enterovirus genus (22). Discrimination between these two viruses using diagnostic tools has been attempted, but no one protocol has been completely successful (7). Sequencing protocols can distinguish these two species, but these protocols are laborious and expensive. A recent study accomplished by Faux et al. (6) tested 10 different specific HRV primer pair in a panel of 57 clinical specimens from preschool children with colds and influenza-like illness in Melborne, Australia. None of the used primer pairs alone detect all the HRV species. The authors concluded that the best strategy to detect HRV was to use \u2265 2 primer pairs.",
