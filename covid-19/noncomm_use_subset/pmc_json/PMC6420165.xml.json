This virus suspension was the basis for conducting viral stability and quantitative suspension tests with biocides. Experiments were performed in the presence of PEG, which enhances binding of HBV particles but does not enable noninfectious virions to enter target cells. First, we evaluated HBV stability at different temperatures by incubation of cell culture\u2013derived HBV particles at 4\u00b0C, 21\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C for up to 28 days. Subsequently, infectivity was determined by inoculation of naive HepG2-NTCP cells, and HBV infection rates were determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Interestingly, no changes in infectivity were observed at 4\u00b0C, and only a minor reduction (10%) was determined after 28 days at room temperature (21\u00b0C; Figure 1A). For samples that were stored at 37\u00b0C, the HBV infection rate was reduced in a time-dependent manner, however, reaching 50% inhibition of infection at >20 days. Next, the long-term stability of HBV was assessed by incubation of the virus at 4\u00b0C for up to 270 days. Remarkably, HBV infectivity remained stable until day 180 of incubation at 4\u00b0C, with only a minor reduction of approximately 3-fold (Figure 1B), and even after 270 days only a 150-fold reduction could be observed. Of note, the number of infectious particles detected at 270 days was approximately 100-fold above the detection limit of the assay (cutoff, 102 TCID50/mL). In summary, these results indicate a high environmental stability of HBV in suspension with surviving times of several weeks at room temperatures.",

For ethanol, a concentration of >40% was required for HBV inactivation, irrespective of the exposure time. The most effective alcohol to inactivate HBV was 1-propanol, reducing viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 30% after exposure for only 1 minute (Figure 2A). In the case of 2-propanol, incubation of HBV at 40% alcohol led to a 100-fold reduction of infectivity independent of the incubation period, but to completely abrogate the infectivity of HBV particles 60% 2-propanol was necessary. The longer incubation time of 5 minutes did not result in higher inactivation levels (Figure 2B). In conclusion, HBV demonstrated the highest susceptibility to 1-propanol, while for ethanol and 2-propanol alcohol concentrations of >40% were required to inactivate HBV particles.",

Importantly, all hand disinfectants demonstrated virucidal activity at the ready-to-use concentration and inactivated HBV to undetectable levels (Figure 2C). Residual virus was only detected after treatment with the 2-propanol-based poly-alcohol hand antiseptic. Next, we evaluated whether a 1:10 dilution of the commercial antiseptics affected the virucidal activities of the products.

Formulation I is based on ethanol, whereas formulation II consists of 2-propanol. To determine the efficacy of WHO formulations I and II against HBV, we incubated viral particles for 30 seconds with both formulations at final concentrations ranging from 0% to 80%. As depicted in Supplementary Figure 1A, viral titers of 107 TCID50/mL in the control were reduced to undetectable levels at concentrations of >40% for WHO formulation I, whereas at a concentration of 40% WHO formulation II yielded a significant reduction in infectivity (Supplementary Figure 1B). Finally, we analyzed the susceptibility of HBV to these WHO formulations in comparison to that of other enveloped viruses, which we investigated previously [11]. This comparative analysis of inactivation response curves revealed that HBV has greater stability than hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A(H1N1) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA; Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D), which is the chosen test virus for all enveloped viruses in the European Guideline for testing chemical disinfectants and antiseptics in human medicine.",

The high environmental stability of HBV observed in this study was also previously observed in an in vivo model system. Bond et al demonstrated in 1981 that HBV-positive human plasma, which was dried for 1 week and inoculated in chimpanzees, resulted in an active infection [12]. This infection system is based on human hepatoma cells and viruses generated in vitro, which might differ from primary human hepatocytes and patient-derived viral particles in some aspects. However, given the recent progress that has been made in HBV research using this system, cell culture\u2013derived HBV particles are considered the best tool to address the questions described here [13]. However, other time points and long-term storage of plasma ex vivo were not investigated. For HCV, another blood-borne virus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, the environmental stability was much lower, with a half-life of 6 hours at 37\u00b0C and 11 days at 4\u00b0C [9].",

The concentrations of the tested alcohols required for virucidal activity were slightly higher than those required for the often-used DHBV [4], but side-by-side comparisons using the experimental procedure have not been conducted. Importantly, 5 different alcohol-based, commercially available hand disinfectants were able to inactivate HBV after exposure for 30 seconds in a suspension test. Dilution of these products abrogated the susceptibility of HBV, but under practical conditions hand antiseptics are not diluted, precluding a recommendation for a specific product. Two WHO-recommended formulations that have been proposed as alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce the transmission of pathogens [10] were able to completely inactivate HBV. Importantly, in comparison to the enveloped viruses EBOV, HCV, influenza A(H1N1) virus, MERS-CoV, and MVA, HBV demonstrated the highest stability. The degree of susceptibility of the different viruses to the WHO formulation likely depends on the specific surface properties of the lipophilic envelope of the respective virus [14]. HBV subviral particles display a fluid bilayer membrane and were shown to have a strong resistance to freeze drying [15]. However, further investigations are required in the future, ideally with serum-derived HBV, to analyze this phenomenon in more detail.",

A, HBV was incubated at the indicated temperatures and intervals as a test virus suspension. Infectivity was determined by inoculation of naive HepG2\u2013Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide cells for 16 hours. The HBV infection rate was quantified by determining the expression HBV core antigen 6 days after infection. Data from a representative experiment from 3 independent repetitions is shown. Blue bands reflect the 95% confidence interval from linear regression analysis of 4 technical replicates. B, HBV was stored for up to 270 days at 4\u00b0C. At the indicated time points, virus aliquots were tested for infectivity by a limiting dilution assay (ie, the 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50] assay). A single long-term experiment was performed in technical duplicates. Bars indicate the standard deviation of technical replicates. C, HBV was incubated in the presence of human and fetal bovine serum at room temperature for the indicated times. Infectivity was determined by inoculation of naive HepG2-NTCP cells for 16 hours. Data from a representative experiment from 3 independent repetitions is shown. D, HBV was treated at different pH values.

A and B, Ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol were tested for their efficacy in inactivating HBV. The biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 60%, with exposure times of 1 minute (A) or 5 minutes (B). For this inactivation assay, 1 part virus and 1 part bovine serum albumin were mixed with 8 parts biocide. Residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. Viral titers are displayed as half-maximal tissue culture infective doses (TCID50). Cytotoxicity was determined by examining permissive cells by microscopy for any significant changes in the cell monolayer and was calculated analogously to virus titers (data are TCID50/mL). Data are mean values (\u00b1SDs) of 3 independent experiments. ND, no residual infectivity detected. C and D, Five commercial hand antiseptics (Sterillium Classic Pure, Manorapid Synergy, Poly-Alcohol Hand Antiseptic, Sterillium Med, and Desderman Pure) were tested in a quantitative suspension assay for their efficacy in inactivating HBV, as described above. Exposure times of 30 seconds were used at concentrations of 80% (C) and 8% (D). Residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay (ie, the TCID50 assay). Cytotoxicity was determined by examining permissive cells by microscopy for any significant changes in the cell monolayer and was calculated analogously to virus titers (data are TCID50/mL).
