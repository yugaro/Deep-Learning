Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) is one of the most prevalent viruses, exhibiting strong renal tropism and the potential to cause significant mortality to the poultry industry [1235]. Chickens of all ages may be infected, and infected chickens are characterized by coughing, depression, nasal discharge, sneezing, polyuria, and death [425]. Clinicopathological studies reported that infection with NIBV can cause the kidneys of chickens to become swollen and pale, with deposition of monosodium urate crystals in tubules and ureters, resulting in visceral gout [1430]. Exacerbation of visceral gout may be associated with adverse metabolic, nutritional, or infectious conditions, and toxicity. Infections have become the most important cause of gout, and nephropathogenic strain of infectious bronchitis virus has become one of the most prevalent pathogens associated with the outbreak of visceral gout [11].",

In poultry, avian gout is usually divided into visceral gout and articular gout. Former researchers have defined visceral gout as a disease induced by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in different internal organs that stimulate phagocytosis and initiate the inflammatory cascade [30]. Edwards [9] reported that elevated serum urate levels were closely associated with deposited urate crystals in intrarenal tissues. Uric acid, which is the ultimate decomposition product of endogenous or dietary purines in chickens, is generated by xanthine oxidase (XOD). Previous studies reported that increases in XOD activity were correlated with elevated serum urate levels [13].",

[5] demonstrated that XOD was a vital mediator in the pathogenesis of human gout. In addition to the generation of uric acid, XOD can catalyze the substrate and concomitant generation of oxygen radicals, which can then induce tissue damage. There is mounting evidence that increased XOD activity is correlated with the development of many diseases due to the concomitantly increased production of uric acid and free radicals [616]. However, to prevent tissue damage caused by oxidative stress, the major antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) played an important role in maintaining the balance between antioxidants and oxidation in vivo [1727]. Tas et al. [31] reported that increased activities of SOD and GSH-PX could reduce the oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rats.",

The 10-5 embryo median lethal dose 50 was calculated according to the formula of Reed and Muench [26]. Each chicken in the infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of 10-5 median embryo infectious doses of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus at 35 days of age. Chickens in the control group were intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL of sterile physiological saline as virus-free controls. Chickens were examined daily for signs of infection after inoculation. Clinical signs were observed at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) in most infected chickens. We then collected blood and organ samples at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (12 blood samples were collected from each group every time). Sera were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,500 \u00d7 g, then stored at -20\u2103 for analysis. Organ samples (kidney) were individually collected into the freezing tubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Previous studies have shown that hyperactivity of XOD occasionally occurs in the body, and that by-products of both UA and ROS play important roles in various pathophysiological conditions [2]. Peralta et al. [22] demonstrated that XOD activity induced by hepatic ischemia-reperfusion was associated with liver and lung damage. Among human diseases, gout or hyperuricemia was also associated with the activity of XOD, and this enzyme has become a target of drugs used for therapy [20]. Therefore, its activity plays an important role in the development of several diseases. Former studies have shown that infection with NIBV could induce elevation of serum UA in chickens [1]. However, few studies have been conducted to explain the relationships between XOD and hyperuricemia induced by NIBV in the poultry industry to date.",

These results were correlated with the serum activity of XOD between infected and control groups. Previous studies demonstrated that XOD activity or gene transcription could be reinforced by hypoxia and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Poss et al. [24] showed that hypoxia exposure alone increased XOD activity, but that mRNA transcript levels remained normal in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. These results may have occurred because the bovine XOD gene lacks a hypoxia response element for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 [24]. However, Pfeffer et al. [23] demonstrated that cytokines including TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-1 could induce increases in both XOD activity and mRNA transcript levels in bovine renal epithelial cells. Asasi et al. [4] demonstrated that the serum concentration of IFN-\u03b3 increased significantly after IBV infection. Furthermore, Okino et al. [21] showed that the highest relative expression of IL-6, IL-1, and IFN-\u03b3 was correlated with the degree of IBV infection. A previous study also revealed that NIBV infection could induce renal inflammatory responses [33]. Therefore, it is likely that the increase of XOD renal transcription and its serum activity was due to NIBV infection induced by the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, further study is needed to elucidate the specific mechanism responsible for the increase of XOD renal transcription and its serum activity induced by NBIV infection.",

Conversely, the aberrant production of ROS could randomly attack lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, causing cell and tissue damage [19]. Former studies have 19reported that overproduction of free radicals could induce excessive degeneration of the polyunsaturated lipids, leading to elevated MDA levels [317]. Previous studies have also shown that MDA was a significant indicator to check lipid peroxidation and cellular oxidative damage [15], and its concentration was positively correlated with the degree of free radical-induced damage. In the present study, serum MDA values were statistically higher in the infected group than the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p < 0.01).

The elevation of XOD activity could concomitantly lead to increased UA and ROS contents. On one hand, the increase of serum UA could lead to hyperuricemia, which is the main risk factor for UA crystal deposition. On the other hand, the increase of ROS could not only induce decreased antioxidants, but also cause tissue oxidative damage.",
