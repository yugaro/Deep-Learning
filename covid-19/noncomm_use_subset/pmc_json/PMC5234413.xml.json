In particular, increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate acute hepatocellular injury, such as viral infection, toxic injury, hypoxia, and hypoperfusion, where ALT and AST levels can rise by thousands of times the levels in the normal range. While ALT is relatively liver specific, AST levels can increase because of damage to other organs [1]. In addition, there are cases where non-hepatic respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections lead to increased levels of ALT and AST without hepatic failure, and such conditions are referred to as nonspecific reactive hepatitis [23].",

            "text": "Other studies on nonspecific reactive hepatitis have reported that it occurs more frequently in younger age groups [11]. In the present study, there was no significant difference between the age of patients with increased levels of either ALT or AST and that of patients with normal levels for both. However, when patients in the increased ALT and AST groups were separately analyzed, the mean age of patients in the increased ALT level group (16.0\u00b135.8 months) was significantly lower than that of patients in the normal group (25.8\u00b126.6 months). On the contrary, there was no significant age difference between patients in the increased AST level group and those in the normal group. This indicates that younger patients with respiratory virus infection are more vulnerable to nonspecific reactive hepatitis, and the degree of influence on hepatic function is better reflected via ALT than AST levels.",

Another study also reported that 49% of patients who underwent artificial ventilation for respiratory syncytial virus-induced bronchiolitis had nonspecific reactive hepatitis [12]. In the present study, 13.3% of all infant patients showed increased ALT or AST levels, which was lower than the incidences reported by other studies, presumably because we excluded patients infected by two or more viruses in order to clarify virus-specific features. In addition, the proportions of patients with increased ALT or AST levels were 33.7% for influenza, 30.9% for respiratory syncytial virus, and 24% for adenovirus, which were different from those reported by previous studies.",
