The causative agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense and RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, the genus gamma Coronavirus. The virus consists of three important structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), the membrane (M), and the spike (S1 and S2) glycoproteins. The nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene is highly variable, which makes it prone to mutation and emergence of new variants of the virus. For this reason, the molecular classification of IBVs is based on the investigation of the S1 gene.1 Vaccination is one of the best ways of immunization of susceptible birds. However, vaccinated flocks may experience disease involvement because there is almost no cross-protection among serotypes.2 Consequently, the viral strains that exist in a different geographical area must first be identified and their pathogenicity should be determined in order to select an appropriate virus strain for vaccination.",

Based on our findings, 12 out of 25 examined flocks (48.00%) were found to be infected with IBV, which show the prominent role of the virus in respiratory involvement of Ahvaz broiler flocks. The IBV isolates in the present study were completely different from IBV vaccine strains (H120, Ma5 and 4/91) used for vaccination in Ahvaz, which indicates the incidence of IB infection despite stringent vaccination. The determination of the IBV genotype is necessary not only to understand the evolution of the virus but also for developing vaccines based on circulating IBV strains in the region.10 One of the significant features of the IB viruses is the emergence of new variants of the virus throughout the world. Therefore, new serotypes and new variants of IBVs are still isolated from chickens, even from vaccinated flocks.10,11 The new IBV serotypes should be identified quickly in order to develop an effective vaccination strategy. Several years ago, Massachusetts serotype was identified in poultry flocks of Iran.4 In recent years, 793B or 4/91 serotype has been identified in Iran by several researchers.5,4,12 Furthermore, the distribution of different IBV genotypes (different from the vaccine strain; Massachusetts) was already reported in Iran.13-15\n",
