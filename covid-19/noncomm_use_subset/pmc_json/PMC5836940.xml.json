Among them, the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) has widely been accepted in recent years.2 NAAT has advantages in comparison to the classical methods of viral culture and direct fluorescent antibody tests. First, NAAT has superior sensitivity identifying RV cases not detected by classical methods. Second, RV testing results are available faster than those of viral cultures. Speed to result allows medical professionals to prescribe antiviral agents and perform appropriate infection control more rapidly. Lastly, NAAT does not need a strict transportation protocol for maintaining viability of RV.3 In addition, the application of multiplexing technology in NAAT allows better detection than classical methods of a broad range of viruses. For all of these reasons NAAT has replaced classical methods.",

The AP assay is composed of two\u2010step RT\u2010PCR. Before multiplex target PCR was performed, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from each sample's RNA through reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction with the cDNA Synthesis kit (Seegene). The mixture for CDNA synthesis is a 20 \u03bcL final volume, including 8 \u03bcL of the sample's nucleic acid, 8 \u03bcL of RT buffer, 2 \u03bcL of the RT enzyme Mix and 2 \u03bcL of random Hexamer with Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: 25\u00b0C for 5 minutes, 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes. After cDNA synthesis, the 16 target viruses were multiplexed into two tubes according to target primer and probe. Multiplex real\u2010time PCR was conducted in a 20 \u03bcL mixture containing 8 \u03bcL of cDNA, 5 \u03bcL of 4X TOCE Oligo Mix primer, 5 \u03bcL of 4X PCR master mix, and 2 \u03bcL of RNase\u2010free water with the CFX96 Real\u2010time PCR detection system (Bio\u2010rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were: 50\u00b0C for 4 minutes; denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. During the interval of the 50 cycles, melting temperature analysis was conducted by cooling the mixture to 55\u00b0C and maintaining for 15 seconds followed by heating the mixture from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (0.5\u00b0C/5 seconds) after 30, 40, and 50 cycles respectively. The fluorescence was continually detected during heating process and the data were converted to derive the melting temperature by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence vs temperature (\u2212dF/dT against T). Seegene viewer software can automatically interpret melting peaks derived and present the results as \u2018+, ++, and +++ positive\u2019 according to detection cycles of melting temperature analysis or \u2018negative.\u2019 Bacteriophage MS2 as an Internal Control (IC) was added to clinical specimens before nucleic acid extraction and was incorporated into the product as an exogenous whole process control in order to monitor during the period of time between nucleic acid isolation to result interpretation. The IC was co\u2010amplified with the target nucleic acids within the clinical specimens.",

AP assay can detect 16 virus types and AD and RQ assays can detect 14 virus types. According to our study, the AP assay can test 40 samples in a single run whereas AD and RQ assay can simultaneously test 16 samples per run. However, the AP assay required the longest turn\u2010around time compared with other assays: 4.5 hours for the AP assay vs 2 hours for both the AD and RQ assays. In addition, the AP assay consisted of two steps, reverse transcription for cDNA synthesis and real\u2010time PCR coupled melting temperature analysis. As such it required end\u2010users to spend more hands\u2010on time to handle the reagents than other assays did. To overcome the time\u2010consuming step in the AP assay, an automated liquid handling system of mixing and handling reagents for PCR mater mix setup could be automated using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton). The characteristics between AD and RQ assays were very similar. Both AD and RQ assays were used based on TaqMan probe and 1\u2010step multiplex RT\u2010PCR combined with reverse transcription followed by real\u2010time PCR in a closed system. The test result of all assays was automatically presented by free analysis software offered from each company.

Among the three assays, performance evaluation of AP assay was discussed in a number of articles. A first evaluation of AP assay against a combined standard of AP, xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel and Seeplex RV15 reported 95.2% sensitivity and \u226598.6% specificity rate.13 About the same time, Cho et al.14 reported that the performance of AP was superior in comparison with viral culture and Seeplex RV15. Huh et al.15 analyzed agreement between AP and Seeplex RV12 without standard method and found that the AP assay produced an equivalent performance against Seeplex RV12. The result of present study also showed that AP assay produced good agreements in performance comparable with AD and RQ assay in performance. In a previous study, AD showed good agreement (98%) against conventional multiplex RT\u2010PCR.16 Similarly, the performance evaluation of AD vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis a composite standard method revealed the most sensitive performance compared with viral culture and Seeplex RV15.17 The performance study of RQ assay was not found in the pubmed database, but evaluation of a previous version (1\u2010step RV real\u2010time PCR) against direct sequencing as a standard method reported 94.1% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity.18 We demonstrated that the agreement between three assays was excellent. Moreover, the end\u2010user in clinical laboratories selecting the multiplexed RT\u2010PCR for RV will need to consider the benefits of each assay in terms of both performance and user\u2010friendliness.",

Of note, when repeat AP assay was done all RSVB samples (n=11) with an initial positive result by single AP identified as negative. Original test results of these samples were presented as + positive as detected by a melting temperature analysis after 50 cycles because they were supposed to contain low virus concentration. Unfortunately, the manufacturing company does not provide target range for virus detection and discloses that AP is a qualitative test for the detection of RV.",

These findings suggest that the discordant results were frequently reported in samples containing low viral copy. Other studies also indicated that discrepant results between RV assay was quite associated with sample's viral load.7, 8, 19, 20, 21 One samples by AP and three samples by AD identified as INF A positive by additional testing. This may be caused by the difference of target region in influenza genome in each assay. Other studies also indicated that detection ability of the influenza virus between commercial RV assay was varied according to subtype.22, 23 Unfortunately, we did not perform the Influenza A subtyping on targeted discrepant samples so any assay in this study cannot differentiate between subtypes of INF A. Further evaluation of performance between assay with regard to influenza A subtype is needed.",

Thus, we could not obtain adequate samples per target virus, such as PIV type 1\u20104, CoV 229E, OC43 and NL63, and RSV A. Those viruses could not be subjected to measure agreement values for each target due to low numbers. Second, another limitation was the use of stored frozen samples. This could skew results of RV detection based on storage conditions and the defrosting procedure. However, since all specimens were stored at the same storage condition and were processed by one skilled technician, we presume that comparison results between three assays was not significantly influenced by this characteristic of the sample.",
