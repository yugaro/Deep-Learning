Liver warm I/R resulted in significant increase in serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). As shown in Figure 1a, following 60 min of warm ischemia, chloroquine treatment decreased I/R injury at 0.5 and 6 h as indicated by lower liver enzymes (P<0.05). However, the serum levels of ALT and AST were much higher following 24- and 48-h reperfusion when compared with vehicle-injected rats (P<0.05). To further confirm the dual effects of chloroquine on liver I/R injury, additional rats were subjected to 90 min of warm I/R. Chloroquine treatment caused a similar dual effect in terms of liver injury when rats were subjected to prolonged warm ischemic insult (Figure 1b).",

To assess the extracellular release of HMGB1 after warm liver I/R injury, serum HMGB1 concentration was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Figure 3b, warm I/R injury caused HMGB1 release in both vehicle-treated rats and chloroquine-treated rats.

As shown in Figure 4, after I/R, phosphorylation p38 and JNK was increased in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, phosphorlation of JNK was decreased, whereas phosphorylation of p38 was increased in chloroquine-injected rats. Phosphorylation of ERK was increased at 0.5 h, decreased at 6 h and then recovered thereafter. This dephosphorylation was partially prevented by chloroquine treatment. Treatment with chloroquine did not affect total cellular levels of JNK, p38 and ERK. These data suggest that chloroquine could act upstream of MAP kinase activation.",

As shown in Figure 6, caspase-3 cleavage was increased in response to liver I/R. In contrast, chloroquine treatment increased liver I/R-induced caspase-3 cleavage.

Of note, I/R-induced phosphorylation of JNK was inhibited by chloroquine precondition, whereas phosphorylation of ERK was increased by chloroquine precondition. Activation of ERK occurred early in ischemic livers, and ERK activation following redox stress was protective in hepatocytes.33 Conversely, JNK activation is a deleterious even in hypoxic hepatocytes via the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and inhibition of JNK activation decreases both necrosis and apoptosis in liver I/R.34 Taken together, these data suggest that modulating of MAP kinase activation is also involved in the hepatic protective effects of chloroquine.",

            "text": "To elucidate the molecular basis of chloroquine-mediated injury in the late phase in liver I/R injury, we investigated its effect on the activation of autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved regulated cellular process by which cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles are broken down and are recycled through the lysosomal degradation pathway.23, 24 The execution of autophagy involves a set of evolutionarily conserved autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins, which are required for the induction of autpophagy, and the generation, maturation, and recycling of autophagosomes.35 LC3, a homologue of yeast Atg8, exists in two forms, LC3-I and its proteolytic derivative LC3-II. After synthesis, pro-LC3 is cleaved by Atg4B to expose a C-terminal glycine residue, which represents the cytosolic LC3-I form. LC3-1 is subsequently conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine to become LC3-II, which localizes on the isolation membrane and the autophagic membranes. As the amount of LC3-II correlates with the number of autophagosomes, LC3-II thus can be used to estimate autophagic activity.36 p62 is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes via direct binding to LC3 and is identified as one of the specific substrates that degrade through the autophagy\u2013lysosomal pathway. Thus, the total cellular expression levels of p62 inversely correlate with autophagic activity.36 Chloroquine has been recently used to inhibit autophagy in vivo without noticeable side effects. Chloroquine raises the lysosomal pH, which leads to inhibition of lysosome\u2013autophagosome fusion and lysosomal protein degradation. In this study, chloroquine blocked autophagic flux as shown by LC3-II and P62 accumulation and aggravated liver I/R injury after reperfusion. Impaired autophagy leads to the development of MPT in hypoxic hepatocytes.37 Onset of the MPT leads to a pH-dependent necrotic cell death as well as apoptotic cell death by releasing proapoptotic proteins factors, which are normally sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.38, 39, 40 Indeed, induction of autophagy is associated with attenuation of I/R injury in liver, as demonstrated recently.21, 41, 42 As treatment with chloroquine significantly decreased autophagy and worsened liver injury, we concluded that the decreased autophagy accounted, in part, for the hepatic harmful effects of chloroquine in the late phase after reperfusion.",

Recent studies have suggested possible molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis.44, 45, 46 Bcl-2 family proteins, the well-characterized apoptosis regulators, has recently become clear that they reduce Beclin 1-mediated autophagy by inhibiting the formation of the Beclin 1\u2013hVps34 PI3K complex and Beclin 1-associated class III PI3K activity.44 It has been demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes via a disruption in the pH of acidic vesicles. Thus, the increased cellular burden of autophagosomes has been shown to precede and possibly induce Bax- and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.17, 18, 19, 20 These previous results led us to investigate whether chloroquine could also increase hepatic apoptosis after I/R injury. Our results showed that chloroquine treatment increased apoptotic cell death as indicated by increased I/R-induced caspase protein cleavage.
