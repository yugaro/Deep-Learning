Both assumptions have had to be re-visited since cellular uptake does involve endocytosis (2) and transport of biomolecules does not occur as efficiently as anticipated at least at low concentrations. In a series of experiments carried out independently by several groups, CPPs mentioned above turned out inefficient in transporting uncharged splice correcting oligonucleotide (ON) analogs as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) for a large part because CPP-conjugated material remained entrapped in endocytic vesicles (3). Accordingly, peptides or drugs (such as chloroquine) leading to endosome destabilization did significantly increase splicing correction.",

Increased cellular uptake could not be the answer since, on the contrary, (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates were taken up less efficiently than Tat\u2013PMO and (Arg)n\u2013PMO conjugates in our model system (3). Differences could originate from a different mechanism of cellular uptake with (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates taking profit of a more favorable route than the other CPP conjugates. Again available data did not support this hypothesis since all three conjugates were taken up by an energy-dependent pathway involving binding to cell surface proteoglycans. Along the same lines, we recently established that blocking energy-dependent processes through incubation of cells at low temperature or through ATP depletion decreased splicing correction by (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates and by Tat\u2013PMO or (Arg)n\u2013PMO ones to the same extent (10).",

This could provide an explanation if one assumes that heparan sulfate-bound material has to be released during endocytosis in order to escape to the cell cytoplasm.

This assumption has to be tempered since the (R-Ahx-R) repeats are linked by arg\u2013arg peptide bonds which are amenable to proteolysis by trypsin-like enzymes. Indeed recent studies in our group indicated that (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates were rapidly degraded in cells at these arg\u2013arg bonds (11). We have therefore investigated a (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate (with r standing for D-Arg) in terms of cell uptake and splicing correction activity.",

Fluorescence microscopy evaluation of the intracellular distribution of FAM-labeled (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates indicated that the majority of the material was entrapped in endocytic vesicles even at concentrations leading to efficient splicing correction. It implies that the biological activity of these conjugates is due to the small (and not detectable by fluorescence microscopy) portion of material escaping from endocytic vesicles. Finally, (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates have shown signs of toxicity when injected to mice at >20 mg/kg dose despite their absence of cytotoxicity in cell culture experiments (12). This presents a dosing challenge for in vivo systemic applications.",

The manuscript essentially aims at comparing series of (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates analogs differing in Arg spacer length, in hydrophobicity of the spacer and in stereochemistry of Arg. Criteria for the comparative evaluation of these conjugates include cellular uptake, splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin, hydrophobicity and synthetic membrane-destabilizing potential.",

To evaluate the ability of CPP\u2013PMO conjugates to escape from endosomes we employed a liposome leakage assay. Late endosomes are characterized by a rather unusual lipid composition enriched in LBPA (23) and have a pH 5.5 lumen (24). We therefore prepared liposomes from a lipid mixture mimicking the lipid composition of late endosomes DOPC/DOPE/PI/LBPA (5:2:1:2) and monitored the effect of low pH on the CPP\u2013PMO induced leakage of a fluorescent dye entrapped in the lipid vesicles. We compared conjugates 1, 5, 9 and (Arg)8\u2013PMO. All conjugates induced a fairly modest leakage that was strongly promoted at pH 5.5. In correlation with the data on splicing activity, (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate was by far the most active in this group, followed by (R-G-R)4\u2013PMO, (R-AbuL-R)4\u2013PMO and (Arg)8\u2013PMO. Interestingly, the more hydrophobic (R-AbuL-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate induced considerably less leakage than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (Figure 8). Our data thus indicate that the liposome destabilizing activity of the different CPP\u2013PMOs correlated with their splicing correction activity. This again indicates that the efficiency of endosomal escape is a major contributing factor for the efficient nuclear delivery of these CPP\u2013PMO conjugates.\n",

It was thus anticipated that the (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO in which some l-Arg residues have been replaced by their d-analog would become more protease-resistant and as a consequence more active in the splicing correction assay. Unexpectedly, (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO was significantly less active than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO thus indicating that metabolic stability is not a limiting factor at least in these in vitro experiments. Whether (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO might be of interest for in vivo applications will have to be evaluated using transgenic murine models for splicing correction. Whether the lower biological activity of (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO could be due to its increased affinity for heparin is a possibility. Alternatively, earlier work from our group (11) has shown that the peptide part of (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO was rapidly degraded in cells thus releasing free PMOs. It is fully possible that the more stable CPP entity may decrease the rate of endosomal release of PMO. Along the same lines, linking a splice correcting PNA and a CPP (R6Pen in this case) by a stable linker gave rise to a lower efficiency than in the case of a reducible disulfide linker (27).",

Saponin treatment clearly lead to a complete re-localization of FAM-labeled conjugates (Figure 6 and data not shown) from a dotted cytoplasmic to an homogeneous nuclear distribution in keeping with a direct membrane translocation in the presence of saponin and an endocytic process in its absence. As expected from these data, splicing correction efficiency was largely increased in saponin-treated cells for all (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO (Figure 7 and data not shown) thus indicating that retention within cytoplasmic vesicles remains a major road-block even for the most active of our conjugates.",
