In general, OVs can selectively kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells intact.7 They achieve this by exploiting the same cellular defects that promote tumor growth. One of such defects is the type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which sensitizes tumor cells to IFN-sensitive OVs such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus.8\u201310 In this study, we used VSV based on its known efficacy as a potent oncolytic agent to several tumor types.11\u201313 The deletion of a single amino acid of the M-protein (VSV\u0394M51) increases safety by restricting its infection to cancer cells with defects in type I IFN response.13,14 However, tumors with functional type I IFN signaling can hamper its clinical application.12",

We showed that N-myc-amplified NB cell lines and a non-N-myc-amplified cell line (TET-21N) induced to overexpress exogenous N-myc had augmented susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing and failed to establish a robust type I IFN-stimulated antiviral state. To study the effects of N-myc on susceptibility to OV, we performed microarray analysis in TET-21N cells expressing low and high levels of exogenous N-myc. Before infection, we found that several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some with antiviral functions, were downregulated when N-myc levels increased. Furthermore, changes in global gene expression upon infection were nearly 10-fold higher in TET-21N (high N-myc) with respect to TET-21N (low N-myc).",

However, the increased levels of this cytokine did not differ significantly to basal levels (P > 0.05), except for, surprisingly, TET-21C (dox +). IFN-\u03b2 levels increased upon stimulation with poly I:C, either intracellular or extracellular (Figure 2b). Interestingly, the increased levels of this cytokine in TET-21N (high N-myc) did not significantly differ to basal levels (P > 0.05). In contrast, endogenous levels of IFN-\u03b2 significantly increased in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) upon poly I:C treatment (P < 0.05).

In contrast, levels of this cytokine in poly I:C-treated TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) were significantly higher than levels observed in virus-infected cells (P < 0.05). These observations collectively suggest that, regardless of N-myc expression status, virus infection does not seem to induce enough levels of IFN-\u03b2 to stimulate the antiviral state in cells, while N-myc seems to have negative effects in the expression of this cytokine when stimulated with poly I:C. At the transcriptional level, significant increases of IFN-\u03b2 was observed upon infection and intracellular poly I:C. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 transcript levels were lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) than those in TET-21N (low N-myc) (Supplementary Figure S2a).

Activation of this pathway results in phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-2 at tyrosine 701 and 690, which allows them to heterodimerize and translocate into the nucleus to associate with IRF-9 and form the ISGF-3 complex. ISGF-3 activates promoters for the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The collective contribution of ISGs renders cells in the antiviral state.29 We therefore studied the IFN signaling through Jak/STAT by analyzing the expression of the ISGF-3 complex and activation of STATs 1 and 2 by phosphorylation. We analyzed the expression of RIG-I as readout for the induction of the Jak/STAT signaling. Cells were infected at MOI of 0.1 and harvested at indicated time points before cytopathic effects were apparent, and components of the ISGF-3 complex were analyzed by western blot. As controls for these assays, cells were treated with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (200 U/ml) and extracellular poly I:C.

SK-N-AS cells (non-N-myc-amplified) were used as indicators due to their ability to establish a robust antiviral state as demonstrated in this work and by others.30 Since extracellular poly I:C activated the Jak/STAT signaling more efficiently than intracellular poly I:C (Supplementary Figure S3), TET-21 cells were incubated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (reduced serum) with or without poly I:C (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 6 hours. After removing media, cells were washed four times with serum-free medium to eliminate any residual poly I:C. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium without serum for another 12 hours. Cell culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to 5% final concentration. Alternatively, cell culture supernatants were fourfold concentrated and FBS was added. Both concentrated and nonconcentrated supernatants from poly I:C- and virus-infected cells were used as conditioned media. SK-N-AS cells were incubated in either conditioned media or regular medium (5% FBS) for 24 hours followed by infection (MOI of 5) for another 48 hours. Nonconcentrated conditioned media, from controls, virus-infected or poly I:C-treated TET-21 cells, did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing (not shown).

As shown in Figure 2c, basal IRF-9 was slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) than TET-21N (low N-myc), which is consistent with the microarray data. Other ISGs that are negative regulators of IFN signaling with potential proviral functions were also found downregulated such as NMI and IFI-35 (Table 1).

DDIT-3/CHOP, known for its pro- or antiviral functions,35,36 is a transcription factor upregulated during cellular stress including glucose deprivation, amino acid starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and virus infections.37 The direct role of DDIT-3/CHOP on VSV replication is yet to be determined. To validate our findings, cells were infected with VSV\u0394M51 at MOI of 0.5 for 12, 18, and 24 hours. As controls for DDIT-3/CHOP expression, cells were either treated or not with 1 \u03bcg/ml tunicamycin (an ER poison) for 18 and 24 hours. Upon virus infection, DDIT-3/CHOP protein was detected at 24 hpi in TET-21N (high N-myc) while undetected in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+). Tunicamycin treatment robustly induced DDIT-3/CHOP in all cells regardless of N-myc expression status (Figure 5a). We further validated our findings in the analyzed NB cell lines. At the protein level, DDIT-3/CHOP could not be detected despite several attempts. At the transcriptional level, DDIT-3/CHOP in response to infection varied among the analyzed NB cells regardless of N-myc expression status (Figure 5b). For example, slight upregulation of DDIT-3/CHOP was observed in LAN-1 (N-myc-amplified) and SK-N-AS (non-N-myc-amplified) while no changes were observed in IMR-32 (N-myc-amplified) and SH-EP (non-N-myc-amplified). These findings suggest that the link between N-myc and DDIT-3/CHOP may be restricted to the TET-21 cell system or, perhaps, certain NB cell populations.",

It is now understood that the interaction of cancer cells and stroma contribute to cancer progression, metastasis, resistance to chemo drugs, recurrence after treatment,39,40 and resistance to virotherapy.41 Due to the highly heterogeneous nature of NB, it is not surprising if some subpopulations of tumor cells with differences in permissiveness to virus infection or functional IFN signaling would hamper the virotherapy efficacy. We performed in vitro assays to study N-myc expression, virus susceptibility, and innate immunity in the context of virotherapy for NB. In this study, we used TET-21N cells, which have been a powerful system to study N-myc in NB biology.26 This cell system allows the overexpression of N-myc at will by adding and removing tetracycline from the cell culture medium (Tet-OFF system). However, limitations of this system include the use of tetracycline, known to alter the cellular gene expression and thus confound microarray analysis,42 and the lack of tumorigenic capacity of TET-21N (low N-myc) to perform in vivo studies in mice.43 Tetracycline seemed to have had a major effect on IFN-\u03b2 expression in TET-21C (Dox +) in response to infection, though the expression of this cytokine by poly I:C treatment, virus replication, virus-induced cell killing and establishment of the antiviral state did not seem to have been affected by this antibiotic. Furthermore, SK-N-AS cells were not protected by conditioned media from infected TET-21C (Dox +) cells (not shown) suggesting limited effects of doxycycline in virus-induced cell killing. Although cautious interpretation of data from the Tet-system (ON and OFF) is paramount, many of the microarray hits from TET-21N cells (ArrayEpress, accession number E-MEXP-2340) have been validated.26,44 Some validated hits such as c-myc45 and some Wnt signaling pathway genes46 were consistent with our microarray data. Although we did not include TET-21C in our microarray analysis and the effects of tetracycline could not be ruled out, validation of some hits (STAT-2, IRF-9, c-myc and IFITM10) by semiquantitative RT-PCR in both TET-21N and TET-21C confirmed our microarray analysis (not shown).",

Some cell lines transformed with c-myc are susceptible to VSV in vivo,17 but its role on promoting virus-induced oncolysis in such transformed cells remains unknown. In this study, we found that N-myc did not cause significant changes in the levels of virus replication, either in the analyzed NB or TET-21 cells. However, N-myc-amplified cells and TET-21N (high N-myc) had increased susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing and failed to establish a robust antiviral state induced by exogenous IFN or poly I:C (either extracellular or intracellular). Virus infection did not cause serious changes in the Jak/STAT signaling, probably due to insufficient levels of secreted IFN-\u03b2. Treatments with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 or poly I:C, on the other hand, caused significant changes in the expression and phosphorylation levels of these proteins regardless of N-myc expression status. Overall, our western blot and microarray data suggest that N-myc overexpression does not affect the IFN signaling through Jak/STAT pathway directly but rather the expression of some ISGs stimulated by this pathway. Therefore, these findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of NB cells to VSV\u0394M51 and alleviation of type I IFN-induced antiviral state by N-myc at least involves the downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions.",

We and others45 have observed elevated levels of c-myc in non-N-myc-amplified NB cells, and its expression significantly decreases when N-myc is overexpressed (not shown). Despite the elevated c-myc levels in these cells, treatments with IFN-\u03b2 or poly I:C established a robust antiviral state. Therefore, our observations and those previously reported for c-myc18 suggest differential functions of MYC proteins on IFN signaling and, perhaps, susceptibility to virus infection and establishment of the antiviral state.",

Though only one time point was examined (18 hpi), differential changes in global gene expression driven by N-myc are likely to occur during the whole replication cycle and virus spread. Most of the identified ISGs have unknown antiviral functions, but it is highly likely that the collective contribution of ISGs and non-ISGs further sensitizes cells to virus infection and alleviates the IFN-stimulated antiviral state. Interestingly, DDIT-3/CHOP, known for its proapoptotic function, was the most highly upregulated ISG in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection. This finding, confirmed by western blot, suggested a possible link between N-myc and DDIT-3/CHOP. However, the expression of DDIT-3/CHOP in response to infection was cell line-dependent regardless of N-myc expression status. Since NB is a highly heterogeneous malignancy, it would not be surprising if this link were restricted to the TET-21 cell system or, perhaps, other NB cell populations. The same seems to be true for the link between N-myc and type I IFN transcription in response to infection and poly I:C treatment (Supplementary Figure S2b). Though our studies with the TET-21 cell system and NB cell lines suggest a link between N-myc and the observed effects on virus susceptibility and establishment of the IFN-induced antiviral state, such link may not be true for all NB cell populations. Studies on the frequency of these links in cells from various clinical specimens would help determine the utility of N-myc as biomarker for virotherapy response.",

However, the observed differences in virus replication and virus-induced cell killing can also be attributed to non-ISGs with various cellular functions (e.g., cell cycle progression, activation/regulation of signaling pathways, enzymatic and apoptotic functions, etc).

High N-myc levels correlated with increases in susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing and changes in global gene expression. Our data suggest that N-myc-driven downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions may be some of the mechanisms promoting differential virus-induced cell killing. These studies suggest that N-myc amplification, a hallmark of high-risk neuroblastoma, can be a potential biomarker of VSV\u0394M51 response, while virotherapy efficacy in high-risk disease with non-N-myc amplification may be suboptimal. Therefore, oncolytic virotherapy for high-risk NB with no N-myc amplification would probably require sensitization of tumors with chemo drugs prior to infection. Development of syngeneic models with isogenic cell lines expressing low and high N-myc levels would provide insights into functional relationships between tumor and stroma, which may determine the virotherapy efficacy in vivo.",

Alternatively, cells were treated with extracellular and intracellular poly I:C (10 \u03bcg/ml and 10 ng/well in a 24-well plate format, respectively) for 12 hours (b). Detection of IFN-\u03b2 in cell culture supernatants was performed using Verikine Human Interferon beta kit (R&D systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To examine the Jak/STAT signaling, cells were infected with VSV\u0394M51 at MOI of 0.1 for 12, 18, and 24 hours. Alternatively, cells were treated with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (200 U/ml) or 10 \u03bcg/ml extracellular poly I:C (in reduced serum medium) for 12 hours. Cell lysates were used to examine the expression of master regulators of IFN signaling such as STATs 1 and 2 and IRF-9. Activation of STAT-1 and -2 were analyzed examining the phosphorylation status of STAT-1 (Y701 and S727) and STAT-2 (Y690) (c). The analyzed NB cell lines were either infected with VSV\u0394M51 at MOI of 0.1 for 12 hours or treated with exogenous \u03b2 (200 U/ml) for 16 hours (d). Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean from three replicates. Dox (-), no doxycycline added. Dox (+), doxycycline added. Ext PIC, extracellular poly I:C.
