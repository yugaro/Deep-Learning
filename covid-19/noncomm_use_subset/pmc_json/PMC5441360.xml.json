The subsequent identification of pteropid bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) as the natural host of the virus precipitated a focus on bats as the source of emerging zoonoses that continues to this day. However, at that time, the identification of the reservoir of Hendra virus (initially known as equine morbillivirus) was urgent and confronting. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the identification of the natural host for Hendra virus, and it is timely to reflect on a pivotal event in that process\u2014the singular coming together of a group of scientists from diverse backgrounds at the Queensland Government Animal Research Institute in Brisbane in early 1996. The objective of the cross-disciplinary think tank was to review and revise research seeking the origins of Hendra virus, and its deliberations were key to the timely identification of the natural host.",

Even mosquitoes had been examined on the basis that they might serendipitously \u201cblood sample\u201d an elusive host that had avoided capture and testing [4]. The second motivating factor was the retrospective identification (in late 1995) of a second Hendra virus incident involving two equine cases and a human case on a property at Mackay, 800 km north of the Brisbane outbreak [8]. The human case had relapsed after an initial brief illness 14 months earlier [7]. Thus, there were now two known foci of infection with this novel virus that were spatially disparate, but temporally clustered within a few weeks of each other. Intensive epidemiological tracing failed to find linkages with horse movements or any other contact between the two case properties. Wildlife surveillance at and around the second property also failed to provide any clues.",

The notion of a more sedentary host \u201chitch-hiking\u201d on a vehicle was considered and rejected, and it was concluded that the natural host would likely be volant. Indeed, the same bird species were observed to forage around horses at both the Brisbane and Mackay properties. Dr Hamish McCallum, at that time a zoologist at the University of Queensland, suggested that flying foxes (nomadic fruit bats of the genus Pteropus) also be considered. After some discussion, it was (somewhat naively) thought that flying foxes, being mammals, were more likely than birds to host viruses that might infect horses and humans. The meeting closed with bats, insects, and cats as the top targets for future studies (Table 1).",
