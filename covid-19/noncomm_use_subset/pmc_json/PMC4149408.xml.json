            "text": "Human coronavirus (HCoV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family (alphacoronavirus 1) and comprises a large group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA virus.1,2 It consists of the largest known viral RNA genomes, ranging from 27.6 to 31.6 kb. Usually, coronaviruses are classified into three groups (group I to III), based on their serological cross-reactivity.3 Their classification is also supported by evolutionary analysis.1 The group I viruses are animal pathogens, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. The group II viruses are responsible for domestic animal pathogenic infections, and the final group III viruses are responsible for avian species infection.4 However both the group I and group II viruses are considered HCoV. The protein molecules that usually contribute the structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV is usually the causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and also the causative agent of \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d, which was first identified in the People\u2019s Republic of China.5 As nowadays, an environmental resistance is shown by these viruses,6 it is urgent to develop an effective prevention for HCoV. Currently, there is no available treatment or vaccine to cure HCoV infections. Due to the ever rising spread of this viral infection, the development of vaccines or antiviral drugs against HCoVs infections is crucial.",

            "text": "A novel approach integrating immunogenetics and immunogenomics with bioinformatics for the development of vaccines is known as vaccinomics.7 This approach has been used to address the development of new vaccines. The present conventional approach for vaccine development relies on antigen expression, in sufficient amount, from in vitro culture models; however, many antigens, while expressed sufficiently, may not be good candidates for vaccine. With these conventional approaches, it has not been possible to control different types of outbreaks of viral pathogens, such as recent avian and swine influenza strains, due to their time-consuming development process. Hence, the rapid in silico informatics-based approach has gained much popularity with the recent advancement in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases.8 The \u201cvaccinomics\u201d approach has already proven to be essential for combating diseases such as multiple sclerosis,9 malaria,10 and tumors.11 However, these methods of vaccine development usually work through the identification of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) ligands and T cell epitopes,12 which specify the selection of the potent vaccine candidates associated with the transporter of antigen presentation (TAP) molecules.13\u201316 Allergenicity assessment is one of the vital steps in the development of a peptide vaccine because when we provide the vaccine into the human body, it is detected as a foreign substance. As a result, inflammation occurs, demonstrating an allergic reaction. For the prediction of a B-cell epitope, hydrophilicity is an important criterion which is usually in the beta turns region. These assessments strengthen the possibility of the vaccine candidates. Therefore, our present study was undertaken to design an epitope-based peptide vaccine against HCoVs (229E, NL63, HKU1, EMC, and OC43) using the vaccinomics approach, with the wet lab researcher expected to validate our prediction.",

As a result, with the help of various bioinformatics tools, we can design peptide vaccines based on a neutralizing epitope. For example, the design of an epitope-based vaccine against rhinovirus,45 dengue virus,46 chikungunya virus,47 Saint Louis encephalitis virus,48 etc has already been suggested. Though epitope-based vaccine design has become a familiar concept, in the case of HCoV there has not yet been much work done. The HCoV is an RNA virus, which tends to mutate more frequently than the DNA viruses.49 These types of mutation mostly occur at the outer membrane protein, ie, at the spike protein.50 These types of mutation increase the sustainability of the HCoVs, by ensuring their escape from both the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses.51 Despite this, spike proteins have the most potential as a target for vaccine design because of their ability to induce a faster and longer-term mucosal immune response than that of the other proteins52 and for this reason, has gained much popularity with researchers.53,54 From this aspect, a universal HCoV vaccine needs to be designed, in order to overcome the adverse effects of this viral infection.",

But recently, vaccine based on T cell epitope has been encouraged as the host can generate a strong immune response by CD8+ T cell against the infected cell.55 With time, due to antigenic drift, any foreign particle can escape the antibody memory response; however, the T cell immune response often provides long-lasting immunity. Here, we predicted both B cell and T cell epitopes for conferring immunity in different ways, but other recent studies about HCoV represented the T cell epitope only, and we want to express our greater findings here.56 There are several criteria that need to be fulfilled by a vaccine candidate epitope, and our predicted epitope fulfilled all the criteria. The initial criterion is the conservancy of the epitopes, which was measured by the IEDB conservancy analysis tool. Among the five potential T cell epitopes, all possessed the same conservancy, of 64.29%. We also found similar conservancy of the B cell epitope, which was 64.29%. Having the same conservancy for all the epitopes, the KSSTGFVYF epitope possessed the highest amount of interactions with the HLA alleles. A very recent study showed a highly conserved sequence in RNA directed RNA polymerase of HCoVs;56 nevertheless, our discovery of a spike protein with 64.29% conservancy among the 56 spike proteins has drawn much attention, and we consider this too as a epitope candidate for vaccine development.",

Today, most vaccines stimulate the immune system into an \u201callergic\u201d reaction,60 through induction of type 2 T helper T (Th2) cells and immunoglobulin E (IgE). The AllerHunter score value is the probability that a particular sequence is a cross-reactive allergen. However, the threshold for prediction of allergen cross-reactivity is adjusted such that a sequence is predicted as a cross-reactive allergen if its probability is >0.06. Here, our proposed epitope\u2019s allergenicity score was 0.02, and thus it was considered as a nonallergen. According to the FAO/WHO evaluation scheme of allergenicity prediction, a sequence is potentially allergenic if it either has an identity of at least six contiguous amino acids or >35 percent sequence identity over a window of 80 amino acids when compared to known allergens. Hence, our query epitopes did not fulfill the criteria for the FAO/WHO evaluation scheme of allergenicity prediction and was classified by this scheme as a nonallergen.",
