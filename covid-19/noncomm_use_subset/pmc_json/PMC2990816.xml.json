There is some controversy around the clinical efficacy of NIV in novel influenza A (H1N1) infection.

In the Canadian experience, \u223c30% of patients were noninvasively ventilated on admission, but 85% of these patients required subsequent intubation and invasive ventilation [6]. In addition, NIV machines have no bacterial or viral filters and do generate aerosols. There are often leaks from the mask, and it has to be removed sometimes for nursing care [24]. During the pandemic, NIV was associated with transmission of disease to health care workers [25].",
