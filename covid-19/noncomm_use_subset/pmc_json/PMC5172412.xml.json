The E protein also has zero net charge over the whole peptide (5.40% for both positive and negative charges) (Table 1). Using SignalP, we predicted a cleavage site of a signal peptide (AYC-CN) at the N-terminus of the E protein that is most likely located at residue position 43-44. We also examined this signal peptide in the E protein of other coronaviruses, and a similar topology was observed.",

Evidence derived from the primary structure, such as a near-zero net charge (Figure 4-II) and a relatively higher pI than either of the two flanking regions (Table 1), provides further confirmation of the TM region in the E protein. The GC-rich region and the predicted TM region are both located in the same place of the E protein, a result of the preferential codon usage by the TM region. A mutant element was identified upstream of the E protein CDS instead of the presumed core leader sequence UCUAAAC, which is located near the beginning of all other CDSs. This mutant element was previously reported by us (UCUACAC at -200 nt upstream of the E protein CDS; ref. 9) and others (UACGAAC at -2 nt upstream of the start codon; ref. 11). This mutant element is homologous to the core leader sequence. However, Previous experimental evidence suggested that a point mutation presumably located within this region increased the translation efficiency of RNA transcripts from the E protein (3).

This motif is absolutely conserved in CCoV, FCoV and TGV (Figure 5) and has been suggested as palmitoylation (8). The distance between the first Cys in the motif and the last residue of the TM region toward interior of the virion is 1 amino acid in the E protein, and 12 amino acid while considering the corresponding motif (NH2-_S-Cys-G-S-Cys-Cys-K_-COOH) in the most C-terminus of the S protein. Based on the predicted orientation, position and composition of this motif, we propose that the Cys residues in the motif of the E protein might provide sites to form possible disulfide bonds with the corresponding motif of the S protein (Figure 8), with reference to the well-known molecule model derived from insulin. Whether the E and S proteins are co-expressed from a poly-cistron or post-translationally modified in a way similar to that for insulin still need further approval.",

The possible existence of the E protein dimer or polymer through formation of the disulfide bonds at the Cys sites should also be considered with reference to the coming proteomics data.

Even the size of the E protein is only approximately 0.2% (228/29725) of the genome, the rare variation of the E protein still could not be satisfactorily interpreted by simple size ratio because of the high mutation rata reported.
