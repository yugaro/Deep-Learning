To control the spread of SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated extraordinary collaborations among laboratories around the world to identify the causative agent of SARS. In April 2003, WHO announced that a new pathogen, the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the coronavirus family never seen before in humans, was the cause of SARS 2., 3.. Subsequently, a number of laboratories unraveled the genetic information of the SARS-CoV 4., 5., 6.. The immense challenge remains to elucidate the mechanisms by which the virus functions and causes illness based on the viral genomic information. Fortunately, outbreaks of SARS around the world have begun to dwindle. However, we must realize that our knowledge of this disease is still very limited (7). It is still unknown how such a new deadly coronavirus emerged in humans. There is no explanation for what viral or host factors make the disease so infectious, and no approved anti-SARS-CoV drugs have been developed. In short, SARS research is still in its early phase, but is facing urgent clinical demands.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequence of the S protein is significantly different from other coronaviruses, with only 24% pairwise amino acid identity (4). The topology of the S protein in SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronavirus, which usually have a huge amount of ectodomains and short transmembrane spans (10). The majority of amino acids of the SARS-CoV S protein at the N-terminus (residues 14 to 1,195) were found on the outside of the viral particle, while only 13 amino acids at the C-terminus were embedded in the viral membrane (5). The configuration of the SARS-CoV S protein exposed on the viral surface may be different from those of other coronaviruses. In numerous coronaviruses, a furin-like protease cleaves the full-length S protein into two similar-sized fragments, a peripheral S1 and a membrane anchored S2, during viral maturation at the trans-Golgi network. The two S fragments play different roles during viral infection. The peripheral S1 portion can independently bind cellular receptors while the integral membrane S2 portion is required to mediate fusion of vial and cellular membranes (11). Noncovalent interactions coordinate S1 and S2 to attack a target cell. It has been widely accepted that the formation of the S1-S2 complex is a key event where coronavirial virion is recognized by the membrane of the host cell (12). For instance, the S protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was not captured by its receptors until the S1-S2 oligomers were formed (13). Interestingly, there is no protease cleavage site in the SARS-CoV S protein; thus, this protein is probably not cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits (4). Does this mean that the SARS-CoV may conduct different infection mechanisms to host cells without intermolecular cleavage? Is it possible to form an uncleaved S oligomer in the SARS-CoV S protein during infection? To address these questions, immunoassay is a powerful tool that uses specific antibodies to define different regions in the S protein. Thus, we embarked on the studies to assess the S antigenic regions.",

As shown in Figure 1, the cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using three SARS sera. Although individual patient sera display different immunoreactivities against the same infected cell lysate, the major immunostaining bands are located around two regions (Figure 1), 50 kDa and 120\u2013240 kDa. Because the molecular weight (MW) of the N protein is 46 kDa, the protein band near to 50 kDa do reasoned to be the N protein. The N protein bands examined in this study have shown a constant expression; nevertheless, the immunostained bands around 120\u2013240 kDa do not display a constant pattern. These bands are likely to be the S protein because the masses of these protein bands are over 120 kDa. Spike proteins have been reported to have multiple glycosylation sites (14). Therefore, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV S proteins may show apparently different molecular weights due to variable extents in glycosylated modifications during infection. To confirm the bands around 120\u2013240 kDa, these bands were excised and completely digested by trypsin. The tryptic fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the composition of peptides (Figure 2). The results from searching the peptide demonstrated that the S proteins are the major components in these gel bands. The sequence coverage based on the data of matched peptides is 72.2% for the S protein.",

For instance, the human coronavirus (HCV)\u2212229E and the canine coronavirus (CCV) be long to Group I, MHV to Group II and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to Group III (15). Viruses within each subgroup have partial antigenic crossreactivity based on the S proteins (16). Koch et al. analyzed the antigenic structure of the S protein from IBV, in which six antigenic sites were located at S1 and two were at S2 (17). Since the S1 protein is responsible for the attachment to cellular host membranes, it is not surprising that this protein is stronger in antigenicity than the S2 protein. Therefore, in many coronaviruses, the S1 protein has been confirmed to correlate with serotype (18). Identification of antigenic sites on the S1 protein has shown its significance for virus detection and classification (18). In our Western blot experiment, the SARS-CoV S protein was also found to be a major antigenic protein. Does the SARS-CoV S protein have any homology to other coronavirus S proteins in the antigenic structure? Does the antigenic site on the SARS-CoV S protein appear biological significance during SARS infection? To address these questions, we extended our studies to search for the antigenic site(s) of this protein.",

To select the candidates for the antigenic peptide, we used several theoretical calculations to estimate the biophysical parameters of the peptides along the S protein sequences. Specifically, we looked for high local hydrophilicity, the charged residues on the exposed protein surface, and accessible surface area. From Figure 3 (upper panel), the hydropathy plot indicates that most regions of the S protein are very hydrophobic. Hence, we only selected 18 peptides derived from the S protein. These peptides, sized from 16\u201325 amino acid residues, possess relatively low hydrophobicity scores compared to the other regions of the S protein. The synthesized peptides were coated on microtiter plates as antigens and screened in the SARS sera (31 cases) as antibodies in ELISA experiments.",

In some coronaviruses, the cellular receptor binding regions with the hypervariable sequences are located at the N-terminus of the S1 protein. The tropism determinant of the MHV S1 protein is located in the region of amino acid residues from 456 to 592 nt (20). The neutralization site of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is located in the region of amino acid residues from 480 to 649 nt (21). Interestingly, these sites were also found to act as antigenic sites in these viruses. MHV 4 is a highly neurotropic virus that produces acute fatal encephalitis in mice. Once amino acid residues in this region are singly or multiply deleted, the neurovirulence would be significantly reduced (20). Therefore, developing a specific antibody (monoclonal antibodies) against these regions could help to further understand the pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Though the SARS-CoV S protein could not be cleaved into two subunits during infection, its antigenic region(s) may be somehow similar to other coronavirus S proteins depending on its folding state. More importantly, the S peptide located at Codons 599\u2013620 is in a region that exists in both MHV and FIPV with antigenic and neutralized functions. Whether this site could bind to a host cell and cause the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV is a tempting topic for further studies.",

In previous ELISA tests, the peptide S599 with different concentrations was mixed with the patient sera for 30 min. The extracted proteins from the SARS-CoV were coated onto microtiter plates followed by incubation of the mixed sera for ELISA measurement.

A tag of thioredoxin was added at the N-terminus of S fragments to induce the formation of soluble S recombinant proteins. Both S recombinants were successfully expressed in BL-21 when induced by IPTG (Figure 6). However, the expression products were in inclusionbodies even with the soluble tag of thioredoxin. Figure 7 displays that the molecular weights of the expressed S proteins are approximately 50 kDa, which are much higher than the values of theoretical estimation, 30 kDa, for both S469-749 and S602-882. Since there is no protease digestion after expression and purification, the apparent MW representing the fusion protein consisting of S fragment and thioredoxin is not surprising. To obtain a high protein yield, the bacterial pellets were treated with 8 M urea followed by a strong probe sonication to completely dissolve the inclusions. Since the denatured proteins retained an affinity to Ni2+, a Ni-NTA column was effectively applied to the purification of these recombinants.

Similar phenomenon was observed in all the three tested patient sera, indicating that the S602-882 protein may contain a strong epitope side to elicit the immunoresponse. The two S recombinants share almost 50% amino acid sequence, that is, 147 amino acids at the C-terminus of S469-749 are identical with the N-terminus of S602-882. The sequence of the peptide S599 is mainly located within S602-882. Hence, this result provides more evidence that the site around Codons 599\u2013620 is an antigenicity region. Furthermore, S469-749 does display positive immunoreaction to SARS sera even though it only contains three amino acids from the peptide 599. Normally, a short peptide with three amino acids is impossible to form an antigenic site. A logical deduction is that the region neighboring the three amino acids is antigenic or there is another epitope site(s) in the S469-749 protein.",
