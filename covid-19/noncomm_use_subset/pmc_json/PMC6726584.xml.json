Additionally, this session addresses the strategies used to mitigate these risks in the United States including the introduction of increasingly sensitive laboratory screening testing platforms and PRTs for PLTs and plasma products. In a first part, the session includes a general overview of the evolution of responses to established, emerging, and reemerging transfusion\u2010transmitted infectious diseases in the past 50 years. Further, it addresses the need for ongoing surveillance for and systematic responses to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), optimally with sensitive metagenomics, multiplexed nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) and serologic testing strategies in sentinel global donor populations. This is followed by a review of the major policy issues pertaining to the development and implementation of PRTs, which if successfully adopted will provide insurance against known and unknown pathogens that may enter the blood supply. It will be noted that these technologies, if applied to all blood components or WB, may allow for the relaxation of redundant donor laboratory screening, modified donor questioning and/or deferral, and simplified handling of postdonation information while preserving or enhancing the safety of the blood supply. The session ends with an overview of the current status of approved pathogen\u2010reduced (PR) PLT and plasma products in the United States with attention provided to their current effectiveness and safety profile. Major reasons for the slow adoption of the currently approved PR products in the United States are discussed including cost\u2010effectiveness (CE) considerations.",

The most striking example of this was xenotrophic murine leukemia\u2013related virus, which was reported to be associated with prostate cancer and later chronic fatigue syndrome and to be present in the blood of asymptomatic blood donors.17 Intensive research consuming much time and money subsequently determined that xenotrophic murine leukemia\u2013related virus did not affect humans and was a laboratory contaminant from cell lines that contained this murine virus.18 These experiences led to the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and FDA to convene workshops focused on proactive but rational and systematic responses to EIDs.6, 7 The Alliance of Blood Operators developed a \u201crisk\u2010based decision\u2010making\u201d process that includes formalized methods for quantifying risk and evaluating interventions.19\n",

Nonetheless, ZIKV testing now represents a theoretical benefit at a high cost, precipitating consideration of regional screening policies and an urgent need to further define \u201ctolerable risk\u201d in the blood safety arena.20\n",

Based on the positive experience of PI for plasma derivatives (e.g., no HIV, HCV, or HBV transmission since 1987), it seems reasonable to apply this safety paradigm to blood components. Of note, a consensus conference held in Canada in 2007 issued recommendations in favor of rapid adoption of a PI technology even if it could not be applied to the full range of blood components. Despite these recommendations, PI technology for PLTs has been slow to be adopted in the United States. As described in Table 1, the reasons for this are many but it appears that the predominant impediment has been cost.",

A recently published BIA focused on an analysis for a mid\u2010sized US hospital that was assumed to acquire 5500 apheresis PLT components per year from an external blood supplier. Several assumptions of this analysis sought to mimic a realistic situation: it was assumed that approximately 60% of acquired PLTs are irradiated and 20% are tested for CMV by the blood supplier. The model predicted minimal cost increase for PRT compared to conventional PLTs after including cost offsets such as elimination of bacterial detection and irradiation and differential reimbursement for treated and untreated PLTs.38 Another BIA conducted for Italy concluded further studies based on actual numbers of PLT transfusion complications and their societal cost at a local level are needed to establish the full cost to benefit ratio of PLT PRT.125\n",

The risks inherent in these emergency blood transfusions can be magnified by donor exposure to endemic diseases such as malaria and potentially to biowarfare agents.

Refrigeration has been demonstrated to significantly reduce bacterial growth as well as reduce the metabolic activity of PLTs during storage, preserving their hemostatic function. Refrigerated PLTs retain significant capacity to adhere to collagen under shear, aggregate, release granules, catalyze thrombin generation, and contract clots for up to 21 days.179 Refrigeration causes partial activation of PLTs, leading to desialylation of membrane proteins and clearance from circulation over 1\u20102 days in vivo.180 Nevertheless, in a randomized trial in cardiac surgery patients, refrigerated PLTs stored for up to 14 days performed comparably to standard\u2010of\u2010care PLTs stored for less than 7days (K.M. Reddoch Cardenas and A. Cap, unpublished, 2019).181 PLTs can be refrigerated in either plasma or PAS, and preliminary results suggest that PRT\u2010treated PLTs can also be refrigerated without loss of hemostatic function.182, 183 Refrigeration thus offers not only an extra layer of protection from bacterial pathogens in addition to PRT, but also an opportunity to extend shelf life and availability while preserving the essential contribution of PLTs to bleeding control. It should be noted that refrigerated WB contains active PLTs that have been shown to maintain considerable hemostatic function through the entire shelf life of WB (up to 35 days in CPDA\u20101).184, 185\n",

While the clinical safety and efficacy of these products is being established, refrigeration with or without PRT offers a practical way to improve PLT product safety and availability. WB PRT remains an important capability gap for the US military, but a technology using riboflavin and UV light has been shown to yield a product with preserved hemostatic function and to inactivate Ebola virus, among other pathogens, and reduce transfusion\u2010transmitted malaria; this technology is in Phase III trials.123, 184, 187 Successful development of WB PRT will be a landmark achievement in the history of transfusion medicine and will benefit both civilian and military patients.",
