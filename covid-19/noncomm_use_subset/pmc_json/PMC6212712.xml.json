Acute peripheral facial palsy may be caused by infections, congenital disorders, systemic disorders, trauma, metabolic disorders, iatrogenic diseases, or neoplasms. However, in most cases of acute onset Bell\u2019s palsy in children, there is no known cause for the idiopathic peripheral facial palsy [2,3]. Overall, the prognosis of patients with Bell\u2019s palsy is excellent. Complete functional recovery usually occurs within 2 weeks of symptom onset.",

Therefore, artificial tears and blindfolds are used as conservative treatment to prevent eye dryness. The use of corticosteroid, alone or in combination with antiviral agents such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, has been reported to be effective in some cases of Bell\u2019s palsy; however, the efficacy of this treatment, especially in children, remains unclear. Steroids may reduce inflammation, neural edema, and nerve compression in the facial canal [4]. In adults, treatment with corticosteroid has been demonstrated to have significant benefits, especially if used early in the course of illness [5,6].",

Exclusion criteria were (1) facial palsy resulting from other causative conditions, such as congenital diseases, trauma, acute otitis media, and vascular lesions, (2) facial palsy accompanied by palsy of other cranial nerves, (3) previous treatment history, and (4) recurrent facial palsy. Patients with Bell\u2019s palsy were divided into 2 groups: one group received oral steroid treatment (group 1) and the other group did not receive this treatment (group 2).

This study provided evidence that the early (within 72 hours after symptom onset) administration of oral prednisolone in adult patients with Bell\u2019s palsy is effective. De Diego et al.

Currently, there is a significant gap in evidence, and no clear-cut guidelines for the management of Bell\u2019s palsy in children exist [16], because the majority of studies are conducted among adults or mixed populations (adults and children combined). Since Bell\u2019s palsy has a spontaneous recovery rate of up to 97% in children, it is difficult to prove the efficacy of steroid administration, as opposed to adults in who complete recovery has been reported for about 80% of patients [1,17]. Un\u00fcvar et al. [18] examined 42 children with Bell\u2019s palsy treated with methylprednisolone, and compared them to an untreated group. Both groups showed complete recovery after 12 months, and there was no significant difference in recovery between the groups. Another prospective study of children <15 years of age from Germany showed a recovery rate of 97% without any use of steroids [1]. Unlike this previous study, Arican et al. [11] reported that oral corticosteroid was highly effective in the treatment of Bell\u2019s palsy in children, even at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisolone.",
