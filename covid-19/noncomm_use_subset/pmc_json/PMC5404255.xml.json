            "text": "During the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, several hospitals were forced to close because of nosocomial clusters of infections. Some hospitals started to refuse to take in patients with similar and suspected syndromes. Meanwhile, the public lost confidence in the medical system, and many people avoided seeking medical attention despite developing symptoms. It is estimated that outpatient visits were reduced by 14% in total and by 30% in public hospitals,10 indicating that public hospitals bore the brunt of this loss of trust. Furthermore, because of patient referral procedures at that time, the referral system was disorganized, which may have expanded possible transmission to other hospitals, making the situation even worse. The Department of Health (now the Ministry of Health and Welfare) established a SARS Coordination Center to integrate resources and coordinate the academic, medical, and private sectors to combat SARS.11 Under the command structure, an infection prevention network was organized, comprised of 12 designated SARS treatment hospitals located in northern, central, southern, and eastern regions.",

In 2008, the responding hospitals were no longer categorized as national, regional, and local, because in the event of cross-regional activation it is more efficient and flexible to launch a responding hospital where an epidemic occurs, as shown by the H1N1 influenza pandemic. In addition, considering the continuously improving healthcare system in Taiwan, all the responding hospitals were able to take in patients with highly infectious diseases and rapidly activate the emergency response plan, regardless of the category level. The tiered system of responding hospitals was determined to be impractical and was abandoned. Soon after a system review in 2012, an expert consultation meeting held by Taiwan CDC decided to gradually adjust the operation and the reimbursement scheme of CDCMN. In 2013, the number of responding hospitals decreased to 22 based on improved hospital capacity and readiness for highly infectious diseases and national-level budget constraints. In 2014, the number of regional responding hospitals was further decreased to 6 (1 per region); however, hospitals that were no longer regional responding hospitals could be designated as local responding hospitals and funded by the local public health bureaus.",

One option is to dispatch the support workforce to the local responding hospital in off-island areas where a patient could be treated directly. The other option is to transfer the patient by airplane to a regional responding hospital. However, the former option would be costly for the transport of the support team, and the latter option could increase the risk of transmission en route.

For instance, both use a centralized patient isolation approach and designate hospitals with stronger capacity, personnel training, and adequate facility and resources.

This system has several strengths, which should be maintained. The command system as well as the responding and supporting hospitals, are empowered legally to effectively activate and coordinate isolation wards, medical resources, and manpower as needed during the early phase of an outbreak. In addition, the command structure connects public health authorities and the medical system to integrate medical resources and share information with coordinating partners. After the SARS outbreak, awareness of healthcare workers' safety was raised. Currently, most healthcare workers exercise good infection prevention and control practices. Furthermore, emergency response plans in responding hospitals are in place, and the inspection of negative pressure isolation wards is conducted annually. In terms of the enhancement of healthcare workers' knowledge and clinical skills, systematic health personnel training and drills have been regularly performed in responding hospitals.",

Also, since there are only a few confirmed cases with highly infectious disease treated in negative pressure isolation wards, the wards have rarely been used. However, maintenance of the negative pressure isolation wards is costly. As a result, economic factors may have reduced responding hospitals' willingness to be in the network.",

The challenges of identifying a role for local public health bureaus in the CDCMN, using negative pressure isolation wards during nonemergency operations, and operating within a decreasing CDCMN budget resulted in a change in the number of regional responding hospitals, from 25 hospitals in 2012 to 22 hospitals in 2013 to 6 hospitals in 2014. This alteration enhanced the local public health bureaus' role in the hospital preparedness efforts by allowing them to identify and coordinate local responding hospitals and enabled local hospitals to use negative pressure isolation rooms during daily operations, which better justified the investment required to maintain them. In addition, the 6 regional responding hospitals received more CDCMN resources (previously diverted to 25 hospitals) to maximize the effectiveness. The changes create a more cost-effective network that still maintains flexibility and surge capacity during an epidemic. Although changes from 2013 to date showed improvement in the operation and budget allocation, current challenges, such as the cost for renewal and replacement of the medical equipment in responding hospitals, the development of integrated and comprehensive training courses of core skills for healthcare workers, and risk compensation payments, need the Taiwanese government's ongoing commitment and collaboration with medical partners to continue efforts in enhancing a more solid and effective system.",
