It has an annual overall incidence of 3.8 cases per 100 000 in the United States and Europe.3 AML is primarily a disease of the elderly, with an incidence of 15 cases per 100 000 for those older than 60 years.3 Unfortunately, the 5-year overall survival in patients older than 75 years is less than 10%.4 Several factors have been implicated in the causation of AML, including antecedent hematologic disorders, familial syndromes, environmental exposures, and drug exposures. Though a number of experimental drugs have been designed for the therapy of AML, most have failed in clinical trials. Except for gemtuzumab ozogamicin that has been recently withdrawn from the market, no new agent has yet been approved for AML in the past 40 years.5 Thus, the discovery of more effective therapeutic agents is needed for AML.",

Toona sinensis Roem (Meliaceae) widely distributed in Asia has been used as a nutritious food for a long time. The edible leaves were used as an oriental medicine with no significant side effects for treatment of enteritis, dysentery, and dermatitis.6 The pharmacological and biological activities of extract of Toona sinensis (TS) have been reported, including anticancer,7,8 antioxidant,9 antiatherosclerotic/inflammatory,10 antidiabetic,11 antivirus,12,13 as well as inhibiting Leydig cell steroidogenesis and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus replication.14 The phytochemical analyses of TS have isolated of triterpenes and phenolic compounds.6 Fifteen compounds of TS were identified, including methyl gallate, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercitin, quercitrin, ritin, catechin, epicatechin, oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid 15. It has been demonstrated that the phenolic acid, gallic acid, a major component of TS leaf extracts possesses antioxidant and anticancer activities.16,17 The biologically active compound in TS extracts may be similar to natural compounds such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and glycoproteins, which are known to induce cell death in cancer cells.18,19 The safety levels and nontoxic characteristics of TS were evaluated using acute and subacute toxicity studies in mice and rats, and no lethal effects were found at concentrations as high as 1 g/kg body weight.20,21 Although various bioactivity studies of TS have been carried out, there is no report addressing the effects of TS on the regulation of immune responses and antileukemia activity in murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells. In these studies, we show the effects of TS on induction of apoptosis of WEHI-3 cells and the promotion of immune responses, and its antileukemia activity in WEHI-3 leukemia BALB/c mice in vivo.",

Total protein content was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The protein extracts were reconstituted in sample buffer (0.062 M Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, and 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), and the mixture was boiled at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Equal amounts (50 \u00b5g) of the denatured proteins were loaded into each lane, separated by electrophoresis on 8% to 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidine fluoride) membranes overnight. The membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 20 minutes at room temperature, and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 2 hours. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody for 2 hours and developed using a chemiluminescence substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). For densitometric analysis, band intensities were quantified using commercially available software (AlpaEaseFc 4.0; Genetic Technologies, Inc, Miami, FL, USA).",

Western blot analyses revealed that treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS significantly reduced the levels of procaspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A).

Leukemic animals have been used to explore for anticancer agents because of the low cost that promotes a short time to develop antileukemic agents in vivo.

On the contrary, overexpression of Bax accelerates apoptotic death.33 Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, which leads to the activation of caspase-9 and downstream cleavage of caspase-3.34 Caspase-9 and caspase-3 are the main effector and executor caspases involved in apoptosis and play a pivotal role in the disintegration of the cells undergoing apoptosis.35 Our finding showed that TS-induced apoptosis was associated with the downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax in murine WEHI-3 cells, and the changes of these proteins disrupted mitochondria membrane permeability and released cytochrome c into cytosol, leading to apoptosis via caspases activation (Figure 2).",

The adjustment of immune responses to alleviate such diseases has been of great interest for several years.36 Recently, several medicinal plants and their products have been used to modulate immune response.37 Furthermore, immunomodulation induced by medicinal plants can provide potential alternatives to conventional chemotherapies for various diseases, especially when the host defense mechanism needs to be activated under the conditions of impaired immune response.38 Leukemia is the type of cancer in which bone marrow cells that produce white blood cells (leukocytes, the immune system cells) undergo neoplasia. The transformed cells unconditionally produce abnormal amounts of WBC, mainly in an immature form. The neoplastic cells crowd out the other cells in the marrow which leads to decreases in production of red cells, platelets, and other lines of WBCs. The destructive aspects of the disease are often exhibit by the lack of these other cell types, which leads to formation of hemorrhage and anemia. Importantly, the internal organs (liver and spleen) bulge up with increased white cells. Furthermore, leukemic cells have markedly reduced immune functions, leading to excess incidence of infections.39",

We selected the 50 mg/kg TS for in vivo studies based on our pretest (data not shown). The results indicated that TS significantly decreased the weights of liver and spleen in the examined animals (Figures 4 and 6). A notable reason for use of this model is the elevation of peripheral monocytes and granulocytes with immature morphology, causing enlarged and infiltrated spleens compared with the normal group. Also, numbers of white blood cells were increased in the WEHI-3 injection group and decreased in TS-treated group. Our experiments indicated that spleen and liver size decreased, which then decreased the white blood cells in the TS-treated group. The recruitment of leukocytes toward stimuli is of great significance for the production of effective immune response. Recently, studies showed that leukocyte values were raised by increasing malignancy in cancer cells.43 Our previous literature suggests that TS exhibits anti-inflammatory potential in vitro and in vivo by regulating the immune system process and the physiological response to inflammatory stimuli. The anti-inflammatory effect of TS involves suppression of LPS-induced production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the serum and organs of mice.44 In the present study, the TS-treated group had reduced levels of leukocytes, showing that TS promoted immune responses in BALB/c mice and exhibited antileukemia activity toward murine WEHI-3 cells.",

As the different components in a given herb may buffer toxic effects or offer synergistic activities, extracts or mixtures of these herbs may offer greater therapeutic or preventive activity in combination.45 In our previous study, a number of compounds, including gallic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, and rutin, were isolated from the leaves of TS, as verified by HPLC, with the analogous information reported in the literature.10 The total phenolic content of TS was estimated to be 130 \u00b1 26 mg gallic acid, equivalents/g of plant extracts. The yield of gallic acid, the natural phenolic component purified from TS, was approximately 10%.8 Although it remains unclear which of the components of TS are active compounds, polyphenols have received increasing attention recently because of some interesting new findings regarding their biological activities. Of these compounds, it has been demonstrated that gallic acid possesses antioxidant and anticancer activities.16 Gallic acid and its structurally related compounds are some of the main phenolic components of both black and green tea, and red wine. Studies have found that gallic acid induces apoptosis in cancer cells (such as HL-60RG, Hela, dRLh-84, PLC/PRF/5 and KB cells) with higher sensitivity than normal analogs (such as rat primary cultured hepatocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts).46 Some studies have shown that gallic acid causes inactivating phosphorylation of CDC25A/CDC25C- CDC2, leading to cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction in human prostate carcinoma DU 145 cells.47 In the current work, TS exhibited antileukemic potential that might be due to the presence of flavonoids and polyphenolics (gallic acids) in it. However, further isolation, structural characterization of active constituents is necessary to extrapolate the mechanism of action.",
