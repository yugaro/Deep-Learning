            "text": "Carbonic anhydrases (CA) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes, which catalyze reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in order to maintain pH balance in living organisms. CAIX is a transmembrane glycoprotein with molecular weight of 54/58kDa. Structurally, CAIX consists of four domains: an N-terminal proteoglycan-like domain (PG) (aa 53-111), a CA catalytic domain (CA) (aa 135 -391), a transmembrane helical segment (aa 415-434), and a short intracytoplasmic tail (aa 434-459). In hypoxic conditions, the CAIX gene is directly activated at the transcriptional level by hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, leading to transport of protons to the extracellular medium and lowering of pH.1 Thus, CAIX expression can be regarded as a surrogate marker for hypoxia in various tumors.2 The resulting acidification of the tumor microenvironment by CA activity and the keratin sulfate unit in the O-linked glycan structure in the PG domain of CAIX are presumed to play an important role in the processes of cell adhesion and tumor progression.3",

In one example, murine mAbG250, which recognizes the PG domain on CAIX was used to construct a first-generation single-chain antibody chimeric receptor scFv(G250)-CD4-Fc\u03f5RI\u03b3 which was then retrovirus transduced and expressed on autologous T cells for adoptive immunotherapy in conjunction with low-dose IL-2 treatment in three metastatic RCC patients. However, two out of the three patients suffered from liver toxicity, necessitating lower CART dosing and pretreatment with CAIX monoclonal antibody G250 to prevent liver toxicities.17 Thus, improvement in both safety and efficacy is required for this cellular therapy against RCC to be moved into further clinical trials.",

Incorporation of CD28 costimulatory molecule into CARs generates CART cells with superior antitumor activities including tumor-induced proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, clonal expansion, and tumor regression in animal tumor models. Two encouraging preclinical findings have established the advantages of CART therapy over traditional adoptive T cell therapy. First, injection of CART cells required as little as 1 week for tumor regression/eradication in leukemia18 and metastistic cancer19 without IL-2, and for established tumors in mice with IL-2.20 Second, in vivo persistence of CART cells in hosts after treatment was strong and antitumor activity was maximized. CART cells incorporating CD137 costimulatory molecule could be detected for at least 6 months in NOD-SCID-\u03b22\u2212/\u2212 mouse bearing human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).18 In addition, in a recent clinical trial, complete remission and long-term survival of effector memory T cells was observed in two out of three patients with advanced chemotherapy-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had received adoptive immunotherapy using second-generation CAR (4-1BB) targeting CD19, illustrating successful translation of such a therapeutic approach.21 Similarly, second-generation CD28-encoded CARs targeting CD19 have shown promising results in CLL, indolent B-cell lymphoma, and ALL.22",

C9-tag expression was only detected at circa one-third the level of the CAIX-Fc protein (Figure 2b, right column), which is likely related to the finding that mAb 1D4 preferentially recognizes the rhodopsin nonapeptide C9 when presented as a carboxy-terminal versus internal polypeptide sequence (data not shown).

Therefore, on day 3 after G36-CD28z CART cell or LAK treatment, the tumors were harvested and sections were also stained with granzyme B antibody to locate the activated T cells. In Figure 6c, the dark brown areas of staining show granzyme B+ T cells that are seen infiltrating into the CAIX+ sk-rc-52 tumor sections (Figure 6c, upper left). These granzyme B+ T cells were seen surrounding the tumor (Figure 6c, upper left (a) and middle) and inside the tumor (Figure 6c, upper left (b) and lower). Tumors with necrotic areas were shown in H&E stained slides (labeled as n inside Figure 6c, right middle and lower) and lie at locations near to the granzyme B+ T cells. In contrast, the CAIX+ sk-rc-52 tumors treated with control activated T cells (LAK) (Supplementary Figure S1) did not show any granzyme B+ T cells. Similarly, CAIX\u2212 sk-rc-59 treated with G36-CD28z CART cells (Supplementary Figure S2) or treated with LAK (Supplementary Figure S3) showed a low-background staining while tumor was proliferating. For positive control of granzyme B staining, CART cells was locally injected into the established sk-rc-52 tumor in mice. After 1 day, the mice was sacrificed and tumor tissue was sectioned for this staining (Supplementary Figure S4).",

            "text": "Second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells also showed superior activity in vivo in inhibiting CAIX+ tumor cell growth compared to irrelevant CART or LAK cells (Figure 5). In situ studies provided evidence of tumor cell apoptosis (Figure 6b) as well as the presence of granzyme B+ T cells and tumor necrosis (Figure 6c). The greater in vivo effector functions mediated by G36-CD28z CART cells may be due to several mechanisms. First, G36-CD28z CART cells showed a greater capacity to proliferate on repeated contact with CAIX+ tumor cells than did G36-CD8z CART cells (Figure 4b). They showed this same augmented capacity to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 on recontact with CAIX+ tumor cells (Table 1). Second, in addition to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine secretion, the G36-CD28z CART cells may be more resistant to activation-induced cell death resulting from tumor antigen contact than with G36-CD8z CART that receive T-cell receptor (signal 1)-only stimulation.31 This activation-induced cell death resistance is due to upregulation of expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as cFLIP, bcl-xL, and bcl-2.32 The CD28 cytoplasmic domain can also serve to enhance cellular activation through protein kinase C-\u03b8-mediated signaling.33 Third, G36-CD28z CART cells may be better protected from suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their inhibitory cytokine, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, due to the enhanced NF-\u03baB activation through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway.34 Indeed, expansion of Tregs was found to be significantly higher in DC-vaccination and cytokine therapy nonresponders than in responding patients.35 These resistances provide extra benefits for G36-CD28z CART immunotherapy.",

            "text": "To avoid the development of unwanted immunogenic response following the introduction of CAR-specific antibodies during adoptive transfer using chimeric TCR receptors, the use of a humanized or a human scFv had been suggested.36 It has been shown that the scFv component of the CAR derived from murine monoclonal antibody MOv18 resulted in detectable levels of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).37 HAMA might inhibit redirected T cell function by blocking the interaction between CAR and target antigen.38 The immunogenicity of CARs can restrict the duration of treatment and thus limit the overall antitumor effect. Indeed, when murine anti-CAIX mAb G250 was used as a first-generation CAR in a RCC clinical trial both anti-idiotypic antibodies and anti-CAR cell-mediated immunity to the scFv component developed that neutralized and resulted in CART cell clearance.36 In addition, so-called \u201con-target\u201d liver toxicity cells was observed that was attributed to CAIX expression on bile duct epithelial cells.17 Indeed, the expression of CAIX on normal tissues by immunohistochemical staining has been documented using murine anti-CAIX mAbs M75 and G250 that are directed to the N-terminal PG domain. This staining is largely restricted to the apical surface of cells of the stomach and bile duct mucosa39,40 and small intestine.4,39,41 Thus, this autoreactivity could be either induced directly by the anti-CAIX CART cells recognizing normal tissues expressing the target antigen or indirectly by antibodies or cell-mediated immunity directed to the anti-CAIX CART cells that have localized to this tissue. In contrast, mAb G36 recognizes the centrally located catalytic domain and does not recognize CAIX by immunohistochemical staining (data not shown), and therefore, it remains to be determined if similar crossreactivity and toxicity would occur in vivo with G36-CD28z CART cells. However, because of the superior effective antitumor functions of these second-generation CART cells and the fully human format of scFv, this G36-CD28z CAR may be a preferred agent for use in future clinical trials, which we propose should require a lower dose of infused CART cells and have reduced immunogenicity due to absence of HAMA and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses to the scFv and CART cells.",

Higher response rate and low toxicity were also demonstrated in patients treated with first-generation anti-CAIX CART cells that were pretreated with chimeric CAIX Abs, a strategy that could be similarly developed here with fully human anti-CAIX mAbs.17 In addition, as other costimulatory molecules including 4-1BB and OX40 continue to be assessed in CAR constructs in order to maximize effective activity of modified T cells18,19,31,44\u201347 opportunities may arise to reduce the number of cells required for efficacious adoptive T-cell therapy.

After 7 days, tumors grew to the size of ~6 mm, and 50 million nontransduced or transduced T cells were injected intravenously. The mice were also treated with 20,000 IU human IL-2 by peritoneal injection every 2 days. Tumor size was measured by caliper in two dimensions and the mean of two tumor diameter was reported here. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care Committee. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 15-mm diameter or 2,000 mm3 and tumors were harvested.",
