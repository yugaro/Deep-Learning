The iELISA1 (Animal Health Trust, UK) is currently used to identify recent infection and to identify exposed animals without signs. This serologic test uses 2 surface protein antigens composed of N\u2010terminal portions of SEQ_2190 (Antigen A) and SeM (Antigen C) and has the capability to differentiate vaccinates from infected animals (DIVA), depending on which vaccine is used. We hypothesize that horses vaccinated for strangles with Pinnacle IN (Zoetis), which is based on a live attenuated, non\u2010encapsulated SeM\u20102 strain of S. equi, will seroconvert when tested 5 weeks after annual revaccination. Serum samples from 26 horses (mean 15.1 years) in a stable with a strangles outbreak 11 years prior were obtained at the time of annual strangles vaccination (S1) and 5 weeks post vaccination (S2). No horses had a history of strangles and mean medical record history was 4.28 years; mean historical Pinnacle vaccines was 5. For each antigen (Ag), seroconversion was determined as an OD450nm value above 0.5. 5 out of 25 (20%) horses were seroconverted to Ag A prior to vaccination (2 of these 5 were seroconverted to both Ag A and C). 5 weeks post vaccination, 12 out of 25 (48%) were seroconverted to Ag A (mean S2 1.09) and 18 of 25 (72%) to Ag C (mean S2 1.7). With a high rate of seroconversion to both antigens, the DIVA capabilities of this iELISA1 in horses vaccinated with Pinnacle appears poor.",

PMA enters nonviable cells with leaky cell membranes and binds the DNA inside the cell once photoactivated by strong visible light making them unable to act as templates for PCR, resulting in quantification of only the viable cells. An in vitro study successfully demonstrated pre\u2010treatment with PMA prior to qPCR on samples of known colony forming units of Streptococci equi equi (S. equi) can identify known percentages of heat killed and viable cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of PMA eqbE SEQ2190 triplex qPCR to differentiate DNA from viable and nonviable S. equi in positive and suspect positive clinical samples. 57 stored (frozen and refrigerated) positive (36) or suspect positive (21) clinical samples (determined via SeeI qPCR as the gold standard) were tested using eqbE SEQ2190 triplex qPCR with (+) and without (\u2010) PMA pre\u2010treatment. Number of S. equi positive samples were as follows: 6/57 eqbE + PMA, 10/57 SEQ2190 + PMA, 13/57 eqbE \u2010PMA, 53/57 SEQ2190 \u2010PMA. The cycle threshold count (CT) for SEQ2190 was lower than the corresponding SeeI suggesting that SEQ2190 is a good target gene. The CT for all +PMA positive samples were higher than the corresponding \u2010PMA sample indicating there was a mixture of viable and nonviable cells in these samples. The low number of qPCR +PMA positive samples indicates that a large number of the samples had nonviable cells most likely due to storage time. PMA qPCR can be used to determine S. equi viability, but testing should be performed on fresh samples.",

Recently, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae, frequently having a hypermucovisous (HMV) phenotype, have been described in humans, non\u2010human primates, and marine mammals. Klebsiella pneumoniae with and without the HMV phenotype were isolated from pulmonary samples from five horses in California and Alabama. All five horses were euthanized; four underwent necropsy examination where the primary pulmonary lesions were severe pneumonia, consolidation, and abscessation. Thirteen K. pneumoniae isolates with differing colony morphologies were obtained from ante\u2010 and/or post\u2010mortem samples from the five horses. Isolates were examined for mucoviscosity using the \u201cstring test,\u201d their identity was confirmed molecularly, and their virulence gene profiles were characterized using endpoint PCR. Eleven isolates from three horses were genotyped by pulsed\u2010field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Six out of 13 isolates exhibited the HMV phenotype including isolates from four of the five horses. All isolates were capsular type 5 and rmpA positive regardless of HMV phenotype. PCR demonstrated identical virulence\u2010gene profiles for all isolates. They were positive for fimH, fyuA, iroD, and mrkB and negative for the other tested virulence\u2010associated genes. Examination of PFGE pulsotypes revealed all isolates from two horses at the same facility were indistinguishable suggesting that HMV K. pneumoniae may be capable of transmission between horses or acquired from a common source of infection. Isolates from the third horse were unrelated to the other horse isolates but indistinguishable from one another. Hypermucoviscous/hypervirulent K. pneumoniae should be considered as an etiologic agent in severe pneumonia in horses.",

The purpose of this study was to identify pathogens associated with foals affected with diarrhea during the first 10 days after foaling. The farm of interest is a thoroughbred breeding farm where up to 30% of the newborn foals by 10 days of age develop diarrhea. In previous years the clinically affected foals have had Clostridium perfringens as well as Clostridium difficle detected in their feces. Despite the use of prophylactic antimicrobials (metronidazole) and infectious control measures, this farm continued to experience increased number of foals with diarrhea. Fifty\u2010nine foals and mares were sampled (feces) for diagnosis of selected pathogens 3 and 10 days after foaling. Samples were submitted to the Hagyard Equine Medical Institute for diagnosis of the following pathogens by culture: Salmonella, E. Coli, Aeromonas, E. durans and C. perfringens. Samples were also submitted to IDEXX for real\u2010time PCR of Cryptosporidium, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, Lawsonia, rotavirus, coronavirus, Clostridium difficle Toxin A and B, Rhodococcus equi and Salmonella. Results revealed no clear pattern of selected pathogens associated with diarrhea in affected foals and non\u2010affected foals, except for E durans. Five of 7 foals with diarrhea and 0 of 51 foals without diarrhea were classified as culture positive to E durans.

Horses were recruited through the ACVIM listserv between January 2014\u2010February 2018. Inclusion criteria were acute onset of clinical signs of hepatic failure and laboratory and/or liver histopathologic features characteristic of Theiler';s disease. Aliquots of serum, liver, and any biologic product administered to each case were tested for EqPV\u2010H by qRT\u2010PCR. Eighteen cases of Theiler';s disease had a history of biologic product administration within the prior 4 months: 12 received tetanus antitoxin, 3 received equine plasma, and 3 received allogenic stem cells. Ten cases occurred with no history of equine biologic product administration. Serum and/or liver was EqPV\u2010H + in 27 of 28 consecutive cases. The biologic product was EqPV\u2010H + in 10/10 cases for which aliquots were obtained. One farm with 4 non\u2010biologic\u2010associated cases was investigated further and 21/40 (52%) mares were EqPV\u2010H viremic. Twenty four mares had paired serum chemistry and EqPV\u2010H PCR. Six of 6 (100%) with active hepatitis were EqPV\u2010H+, and 11 of 18 (61%) with normal liver enzymes were EqPV\u2010H+. Fourteen of 21 (66%) EqPV\u2010H + mares were persistently infected for 1 year without clinical disease. In conclusion, 27/28 consecutive cases of Theiler';s disease were infected with EqPV\u2010H, but infection was also common in horses with subclinical hepatitis and clinically healthy horses. These findings suggest that fulminant hepatitis is an important, but rare, outcome of EqPV\u2010H infection. Further studies should be performed to definitively prove EqPV\u2010H is the cause of Theiler';s disease.",

            "text": "Assessment of renal function includes measurement of serum creatinine (Cr) concentration along with urine specific gravity. Unfortunately, Cr is an insensitive measure for loss of renal function that can also be affected by age, sex, and muscle mass (breed). Serum concentration of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) has recently been introduced in small animal practice as a more sensitive measure to assess renal function, with values > 14 \u00b5g/dL supportive of renal disease. SDMA has also been reported to be less affected by age, sex, and breed. The purpose of this study was to measure SDMA in cohorts of draft horse breeds, as well as to assess potential differences with age or sex. SDMA was measured using a proprietary test and Cr was measured by an automated chemistry analyzer in jugular venous blood collected from 165 healthy draft horses, including 50 Belgians, 51 Clydesdales, and 64 Percherons. Age was obtained from owners/trainers. SDMA values were normally distributed while Cr and age were not; thus, median values and 25% and 75% confidence intervals (CI) were determined for the latter. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, ANOVA on ranks, t tests, and Spearman rank order correlation. Mean/median values for age, SDMA and Cr by breed are found in the table. Median age was not different between breeds and there were no significant correlations between age and SDMA or Cr concentrations (numbers of horses < 1 year of age were small [n = 12]). There was also no difference in SDMA or Cr concentrations between sexes. SDMA was correlated to Cr (R = 0.59, p < 0.001). In conclusion, although significant differences were observed in SDMA concentrations between these draft horse breeds, all values were less than the upper end of the reference range for small animals and absolute differences between breeds were small. Further evaluation of SDMA concentration in horses with decreased renal perfusion and renal disease are warranted.",

The study was conducted as a double\u2010blind randomized controlled trial. Twenty\u2010four Angus steers were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups; Meloxicam (MEL, 0.5 mg.kg BW every 48 hours for 3 treatments), Ceftiofur (CEF, Excenel RTU 2.2 mg/kg SQ every 48 hours for 3 treatments), Meloxicam and Ceftiofur (MEL+CEF, each at concordant dosages, routes, and duration), and No Therapy (CON). Bronchopneumonia was induced with an intra\u2010tracheal deposition of 3 \u2013 5 x 109 CFUs of Mannheimia haemolytica (OSU type 1 strain). All care givers and research personnel were blinded to treatment. Calves were outfitted with accelometers and RFID tags for continuous behavioral, feed, and positional data capture. Clinical assessment and rectal temperature was assessed twice daily. Rectal temperature was significantly reduced for all treatment groups compared to control calves at 24 h and 36h post\u2010inoculation (SE = 0.1875, P < 0.0001). MEL+CEF improved feed intake at 24 hrs (SE = 0.45, P = 0.01) and increased average daily gain (SE = 0.077, P < 0.001) and feed conversion ratio (SE = 1.50, P < 0.001). Over all lying time was increased for control calves (SE = 2.56, P < 0.01). In conclusion, meloxicam, when combined with antimicrobials, can improve clinical illness behavior and economically relevant performance outcomes and should be considered an important adjunctive therapy.",

PBMCs were stimulated with BVDV\u20101, BVDV\u20102, BHV\u20101, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida and evaluated for clonal proliferation and secretion of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201017 into cell culture supernatants. Functional capacities of PMNs were evaluated in response to stimulation with S. aureus antigen (SA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN). Complete blood counts (CBC) and serum biochemical profiles were performed for each animal at time of sample collection. Compared to STR calves, UNS calves had significantly greater lymphocyte proliferative responses following stimulation with viral and bacterial antigens (P < 0.05). In addition, PMNs isolated from UNS calves had a greater ability to phagocytose E. coli and S. aureus when compared to STR calves. Serum non\u2010esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were significantly higher in STR calves (P < 0.01). Serum \u03b2\u2010hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was significantly lower in STR calves (P < 0.01).

In studies in dogs and cats, omeprazole has been shown to be more effective at raising gastric pH and it is now recommended for GUE treatment. However, famotidine continues to be widely used by veterinary practitioners especially for conditions in which potent acid suppression is not desired. In dogs and humans, the acid suppressing effect of famotidine decreases over time, often within 1\u20102 weeks. Every other day (EOD) famotidine administration might prevent the induction of tolerance. Our study objectives were to determine if (1) daily famotidine administration leads to tolerance in cats, and, (2) EOD administration prevents the induction of tolerance. In a randomized, crossover study, 16 cats received 1 mg/kg famotidine orally q12h daily or twice\u2010daily EOD for 2 weeks. Intragastric pH was compared on treatment days 1 and 13 within and between treatments using Repeated Measures Mixed Effects ANOVA. Continued famotidine administration resulted in a significant decrease in mean pH, (mean percentage time) MPT intragastric pH was \u2265 3, and MPT intragastric pH was \u2265 4 (P \u2264 0.01) on treatment day 13 as compared to day 1 when cats received daily famotidine but not when they received it EOD. This resulted in a mean decrease in pH by 1.3 on day 13 compared to day 1. Furthermore, a mean decrease of MPT \u2265 3 and MPT \u2265 4 by 30 and 27% were observed for the same time period, respectively. Repeated twice\u2010daily, oral famotidine administration resulted in a diminished effect on gastric pH in cats. The weak, acid\u2010suppressing effect of famotidine can be prevented by administering the drug EOD or limiting its use to a few days in duration.",
