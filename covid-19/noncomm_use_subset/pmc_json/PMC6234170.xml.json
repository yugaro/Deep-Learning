The physical layout of the emergency centre itself, including the number of emergency centre beds, was documented more often.

For example, inpatient beds (10%) and total outpatient visits per year (5%) were underreported. Metrics obtained directly from within the footprint of the EC were reported more reliably, for example annual EC patient volume (90%) was consistently reported as a measure of EC capacity. Similarly, patient events that occur outside the EC are infrequently reported in publications of emergency care in LMICs. Rates of 48 h mortality (10%) and need for subspecialty care (10%) had low-rates of reporting possibly because they do not occur within the patient\u2019s EC stay, while data such as type of population served (90%) and gender (63%) are both readily obtained during the EC stay itself and thus more frequently reported. It is instructive to note that studies were 3\u20134\u00d7 as likely to report important metrics like patient mortality in the EC, compared to reporting that required follow up of patients after disposition to the inpatient service. This may be the result of weaknesses in hospital-wide health information systems in most facilities in LMICs, resulting in inability to consistently capture data on these events as part of the emergency care data recorded. Finally, the rate of patients \u201cbrought-in-dead\u201d was only reported 7% of the time\u2014this complicates interpretation of in-EC mortality rates, since some hospitals may report these patients as having died in the EC.

The information that is collected is confounded by dissimilar practices for data acquisition and reporting. Many LMICs lack designated emergency centres altogether, and therefore the ability to accurately describe emergent patient presentations and the acute care delivered is lost. Researchers are bound by the constraints of previously collected administrative data, and lack the tools to initiate prospective data collection in order to answer clinical questions regarding the emergent and life-saving care they provide for their patients. Our goals are to increase the scope of publications from LMICs; facilitate data collection and analysis; improve the ability to translate findings of LMIC emergency care research to other similar settings; gain a better understanding of the burden of disease; and potentially improve patient outcomes by reducing the barriers to clinical research. To do so, we provide a framework for reporting results of emergency care research that is simple to use and which has been tailored to resource-constrained settings in LMICs.",
