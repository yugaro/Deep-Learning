DCEs make a methodological contribution to safety research by engaging the multistage decision strategies likely to influence the intent to participate in real-world safety initiatives,29 reducing the influence of social desirability biases,30 and improving the estimates of the relative value of the individual components of complex safety initiatives.31",

Previous studies suggest that, while patients respond positively to safety partnerships focusing on strategies to ensure the accuracy of medication administration,6 they are uncomfortable in addressing staff compliance with hand hygiene protocols.6 We predicted, therefore, that:HYP 1.

RQ 4 addressed a gap in the literature regarding the type of engagement strategies patients prefer.

If they agreed, a research team member explained the study, obtained electronic consent, and administered the survey on a laptop computer. Of 1,883 approached, 1,609 (85.4%) agreed to consider participation.

The Family Advisory Council consisted of parents, family members, and community representatives who collaborate with health professionals and leaders to promote family-centered care. Staff participating in focus groups or interviews included registered nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, imaging technologists, clinical managers, and environmental aides. Recordings were transcribed and summarized thematically. Next, we identified widely disseminated safety partnerships and attributes of the implementation process that might influence patient decisions (eg, safety partnership decision making or training). Using a consensual process, we narrowed this information to 15 safety partnership attributes. Attributes ranged from the point of care (eg, medication and identity double checks) to policy and governance (safety committee membership).26 Each attribute included four levels42 selected to combine logically with the levels of other attributes.31,41 We included a level depicting the absence of most attributes.31",

Perceived behavioral control: self-efficacy reflected confidence in one\u2019s ability to contribute to safety partnerships. Perceived behavioral control: barriers reflected factors that might prevent participation in safety partnerships and intent reflected the stated willingness to participate in different safety partnership activities.

Preference for a visual communication strategy was strongest in the passively engaged segment. We were surprised by the number of participants predicted to choose a visual strategy. There may be several explanations for this finding. Patients, for example, may perceive signs to be less of a burden to staff than a personal discussion.3 In a sample of 277 health care workers, 26% felt there was insufficient time to encourage patients to ask about hand washing.22 Signs may also put less pressure on those who find safety partnerships inconsistent with their perception of the patient\u2019s role. In addition to their alignment with the preferences of a significant number of participants, the signage and visual prompts included in a range of health, safety, and infection control initiatives56,57 can simultaneously inform patients, family members, staff, and the administrators who are critical to the success of large-scale safety initiatives.39,58 Signs can be prepared in multiple languages, use an array of interactive strategies, allow patients to review safety recommendations, and facilitate the positioning of reminders at key points along the health service pathway.59 Despite these advantages, effective signage requires careful attention to visual appeal, content, health literacy, and culture;39,60,61 evidence regarding its unique contribution to hospital safety is lacking.39",
