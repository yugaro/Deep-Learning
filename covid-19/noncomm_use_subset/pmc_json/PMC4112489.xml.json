Indeed, patients with CF infected with P aeruginosa produce droplet nuclei containing viable bacteria.17 Furthermore, studies using air sampling in CF clinical settings have demonstrated viable P aeruginosa after physiotherapy and in corridors outside inpatient cubicle rooms housing patients with shared strain P aeruginosa infection.18\n19 Others have also suggested that airborne transmission is feasible, with shared and mucoid P aeruginosa strains having a survival advantage.20\n21 However, methods used in previous studies were unable to demonstrate how long viable bacteria were present in aerosols or how far they could travel from the original source. We therefore sought to enhance understanding of P aeruginosa aerosol production in CF in order to (i) determine the duration and distance of viable cough aerosols, (ii) identify the factors influencing pathogen viability and to (iii) understand the effects of room ventilation on controlling the duration of viable airborne P aeruginosa.",

These data have substantial implications for CF infection control practices. Our modelling suggests that increasing room ventilation provides some benefit; however, the time required to remove 90% of potentially infectious aerosols still exceeds 10 min despite substantial increases in ACH (figure 3). A new paradigm may be needed, such as employing within CF centres advanced ventilation and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) techniques to achieve infection control, as is done for TB clinics.30\n31",

The infectious inoculum required to establish P aeruginosa infection in CF is unknown and may vary between patients.20 Thus, it is impossible to estimate to what extent viable aerosols of P aeruginosa need to be removed to eliminate the risk of infection in susceptible patients. In many CF clinical settings, contact and droplet infection control measures have been implemented, but reduced rates of shared P aeruginosa strain infections have been reported only in centres employing strict cohort segregation based upon molecular typing surveillance.15 It therefore remains uncertain whether these simpler measures are sufficient, and if preventing airborne transmission should also be considered when strict segregation of large patient cohorts attending major CF centres is not always feasible.14",

Thus, we cannot comment on viable aerosol production during coughing by younger or healthier patients or in those with transient P aeruginosa infections. In addition, we used culture media that selected for aerobic gram-negative bacteria and we cannot provide data on other microbes, including Staphylococcus aureus, non-tuberculous mycobacteria or respiratory viruses.14\n32\n33 Future studies using other selective media to determine the viability of other microorganisms in cough aerosols are now required. Due to bactericidal effects, it is also possible that the bacitracin used in the culture media reduced the recovery of some P aeruginosa organisms. Finally, modelling data assume that the room air is perfectly mixed, which is rarely the case. As such, our estimates of the time taken to remove viable P aeruginosa from a clinic room may be overestimates or underestimates of real-world scenarios (see online supplementary methods).",
