            "text": "Positive-stranded RNA viruses form intracellular membrane-bound organelles after infection, and these organelles are believed to facilitate intracellular RNA replication (1, 2). In the coronaviruses, which cause diseases in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), these replicative structures take the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMV), which later develop into clusters where the outer DMV membranes are connected by a network of convoluted membrane (CM) tubules (3\u20135). DMV clusters are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (4, 6) and contain newly synthesized viral RNA and viral replicase proteins (4, 7\u201313). Previous reports have linked organelle formation to ongoing RNA replication (4, 14, 15). This has been interpreted as evidence that DMVs either are required for coronavirus RNA synthesis or are generated as a result of viral RNA synthesis (4, 14).",

The conserved gene cluster from the nsp3 gene to the nsp6 gene contains all the factors necessary for DMV formation: nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 are needed to form DMV clusters (17) after essential processing by proteinases located in nsp3 (18) and nsp5 (19). Electron microscopy suggests that nsp3 induces membrane proliferation (17). nsp3 and nsp4 localize predominantly to the CM in DMV clusters (4, 9, 20) and are sufficient to induce structures resembling CMs in the absence of other viral proteins (17). Mutations in nsp4 have been linked to formation of aberrant DMVs with apparent defects in membrane pairing (21). nsp6 from several coronaviruses causes single-membrane LC3-containing vesicles (22) to accumulate around microtubule organization centers (17), although it is not clear how this is connected to the formation of DMV clusters.",

We chose to work with ts viruses as a pool of ready-made replicase point mutants that have been preselected for both robust growth at 33\u00b0C and functional importance, since each of the ts mutations is lethal at 40\u00b0C. We carried out these tests in order both to better understand the connection between organelles and viral RNA synthesis and to examine whether mutation of critical residues produces a detectable effect on the replicative organelle. To do this, we quantified virus release, DMV formation, RNA synthesis, and competitive fitness in a variety of cell types.",

Albts16 has a mutation in a loop within the carboxyl-terminal domain of Mpro (23, 31). Albts22 has a mutation in the predicted thumb domain of the polymerase fold near the carboxyl terminus of nsp12 (23, 32). W\u00fcts18 has a mutation on the surface of the viral 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (23, 33). The last mutant chosen was the previously undescribed Brts105, which contains a single proline to serine substitution (CCA to UCA) at position 19320 in sequence AY700211 (Fig. 1). The Brts105 mutation falls in the viral N7-methyltransferase domain of nsp14 (34), between the previously characterized W\u00fcts38 and Albts17 mutations, both of which map to cistron IV (23).",

The assay takes advantage of the eclipse phase, during which RNA replication takes place but no new virus emerges, which lasts for 6 h after inoculation (5). The stop/resume assay works by stopping RNA synthesis 4.5 h after inoculation, during the eclipse phase. After 3 h under stopped conditions, RNA synthesis was then either resumed for 4 h, in order to allow the release of new virus with the participation of previously synthesized components, or kept under stopped conditions (Fig. 2D). If the resumed titer was significantly higher than the stopped titer (typically about a 10-fold increase), then the ts phenotype was classified as mild, meaning that some residual function or functional components were available after the stoppage period, but if the titer did not increase significantly after resumption, then the ts phenotype was classified as severe.",

To control for the possibility that DMV size differences were due to variation in preparation for electron microscopy, 1,352 intracellular virions were measured from the same micrographs.

In these assays, an equal number of plaque-forming units of wild-type virus and one ts virus were added at low multiplicity to either continuous or primary cells, which were then incubated at 33\u00b0C. Fitness was calculated as the ratio of mutant virus to wild-type virus present in the supernatant at the end of the competition. In this assay, a ratio of 1 would indicate that the viruses were equally fit, higher ratios indicate that the mutant virus is fitter than the wild type, and lower ratios indicate that the mutant virus is less fit than the wild type. Viruses were differentiated by means of plaque assays initiated at 33\u00b0C for 1 h and then continued by incubation at either 40\u00b0C (where only the wild type forms plaques) or 33\u00b0C (where both viruses form plaques). The assay was validated by performing differential plaque assays on pure samples of the wild type and Brts105 (Fig. 5A). The number of plaques formed by the wild type did not differ significantly at the two temperatures. Brts105 formed plaques in 33\u00b0C plaque assays but not in plaque assays initiated at 33\u00b0C and then continued by incubation at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 5A). This demonstrated that titers of wild-type and ts viruses can be distinguished by differential plaque assays and that the reversion rate of Brts105 was less than 10\u22125 and therefore would not detectably complicate the interpretation of competition experiments, which typically produced more than 106 PFU/ml.",

However, other studies have shown that replicative organelles disappear within about 2 h of treatments that strongly inhibit viral RNA synthesis (14, 15). In this study, we documented viruses with a range of organelle sizes and prevalence that were sufficient to support wild-type levels of viral growth. This included two viruses of the six tested (Brts31 and Brts105) that replicated normally with half the normal complement of organelles or less. These results extend findings that attenuated nsp4 mutant viruses produce fewer organelles than normal (21).

This finding was anticipated by a recent study that demonstrated that subcellular compartments that contain double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (i.e., probable DMVs) were not necessarily sites of active RNA replication (38). We unexpectedly found that viruses that produced larger and more numerous DMVs did not have a consistent fitness advantage in primary or continuous cells under test conditions. However, it is quite possible that further testing in primary macrophages or live animals would reveal a competitive advantage for increased organelle numbers or increased DMV capacity. A previous analysis of coronavirus RNA replication had shown that viral dsRNA colocalizes well with nonstructural proteins early in infection but that the correlation becomes less clear over time (38). Nevertheless, these results are the first direct evidence to our knowledge that intracellular RNA synthesis can be at least partially decoupled from formation of replicative organelles. We also report here for the first time that viruses with mutations in all 5 known cistrons of the MHV replicase form either slightly or substantially smaller DMVs, suggesting that while DMVs are formed primarily by nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 mutants (17), mutations in any part of the replicase locus can potentially restrict DMV formation. This suggests that the size and potentially the form of the replicative organelle may be dependent on factors other than the amount of RNA synthesis, such as the efficiency of polyprotein processing.",

The results presented here should be taken with two caveats: that the effects of the mutations may be indirect, and that comparisons of growth and competition could be performed only at reduced temperature. Although all ts viruses except for Albts22 matched the output of the wild type at reduced temperature, reduced temperature may affect replication and the processes that lead to DMV formation differently.",

While it is possible that the N7 methyltransferase activity of nsp14 is involved in an early step of DMV formation, a more likely explanation is that the mutation alters long-range protein folding or protein processing that occurs upstream of DMV formation, as observed previously for mutations in nsp10 and nsp3 (14, 27). However, further work will be needed to study the effects of the Brts105 mutation on the function of other essential replicase proteins such as nsp5 (14, 27) or protein complexes such as the nsp10-nsp14-nsp16 RNA cap methylation complex (43).

RNA was extracted from purified virus using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Purified wild-type and Brts105 RNAs were mixed in molar ratios from 1:5 to 5:1 for use as standards at this stage. Virion RNA and standards were converted to cDNA by reverse transcription with random hexamer primers and amplified with primers bracketing the mutation in Brts105, forward primer 5\u2032 GCAATAGGTATGATGTGTG 3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032 GCTGTGGTTGCCGTATTGTAAG 3\u2032. Amplicons were then sequenced commercially (Source Bioscience) using the same MHV-specific primers. Results were regressed to the proportion of sequencing peak height, normalized to standards.",
