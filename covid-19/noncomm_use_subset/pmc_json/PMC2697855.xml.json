Consider, for example, the proliferation of references to \u2018preparedness\u2019; specifically, \u2018public health emergency preparedness\u2019 and its more specialised variants such as \u2018public health emergency legal preparedness\u2019 and \u2018international legal preparedness\u2019. There is also increasing use of related phrases such as \u2018global public health security\u2019 and \u2018international health security\u2019. Of course, a proliferation of terms is not enough to prove that a new force is in play: language shifts all the time in all sorts of areas, and although such changes may reflect and contribute to deep social transformation, they can also be nothing more than passing fashions with little or no impact. But public health emergency preparedness does not feel like a superficial, short-lived trend: in fact, it seems almost the exact opposite. Indeed, as David Fidler and Laurence Gostin emphasise in their recent book, Biosecurity in the Global Age, a \u2018policy revolution\u2019 seems to have taken place \u2013 a revolution brought about by a \u2018collision\u2019 of public health and security.1",

But before explaining why, we need to define \u2018public health emergency preparedness\u2019, in particular its impressive\u2013sounding correlate, \u2018global public health security\u2019, and its less readily comprehensible subset, \u2018public health emergency legal preparedness\u2019. In the World Health Report 2007, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), described \u2018global public health security\u2019 as \u2018the reduced vulnerability of populations to acute threats to health\u2019.2 Later in the same report, more detailed definitions were provided:\nPublic health security is \u2026 the activities required, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute public health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. Global public health security widens this definition to include acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries \u2026 .[G]lobal health security, or lack of it, may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability.3\nThe other term that requires some explanation is \u2018public health emergency legal preparedness\u2019. Stated shortly, this is all about having the right laws in place and then using them in the right way in a time of public health emergency.4 In other words, it is about both legal preparedness for, and response to, public health emergencies \u2013 it is both proactive and reactive. More generally, it can be said to be an essential part of both public and global public health security, and a subset of public health emergency preparedness.",

The aim is to present a human rights lawyer's perspective on both public health emergency preparedness and, more generally, the turn towards securing public health through securitisation. We develop this perspective by asking the following question: is human rights prepared for public health emergency preparedness? We are not confident that it is. In what follows, we explain why we take this view and we also sketch out a preliminary agenda designed to encourage greater human rights preparedness. We focus in particular on the importance of thinking through how risk and its relationship to rights is being framed, and also how this relationship ought to be framed.",

The detailed version of this response would run as follows: focusing first on national security, the effect of disease on military strength and preparedness is, without doubt, an age-old concern. Infectious diseases can also be a source of indirect harm to national security given their potential to cause \u2018political and economic damage in countries in which a state has vital security, foreign policy, and trade interests\u2019.5 Turning next to economic security, it is clear that here too there is a longstanding link to health. The first International Health Regulations (1969) and their predecessors, the International Sanitary Regulations (1951), were explicit about this link: they aimed to \u2018ensure the maximum security against the international spread of diseases with a minimum interference with world traffic\u2019.6 Finally, a third, more general, link between health and security arises from the fact that infectious diseases can \u2018erode governance capacities\u2019 and undermine \u2018a population's confidence and trust in the political leadership and system\u2019.7",

On 12 March 2003, WHO issued its first global alert about the new infectious disease. Three days later, it issued a second alert, naming the disease, offering guidance to health professionals and public health authorities, and alerting international travellers to the spread of the disease. Within four months, however, transmission of SARS had been interrupted in all affected countries and, on 5 July 2003, WHO announced that the outbreak had been contained. In total, 8,098 cases of SARS were recorded in 26 countries, with 774 documented deaths (hospital staff were most affected). There were also serious financial implications due to disruption of travel, tourism, trade and production; WHO's estimate is that the outbreak cost US $12.3 billion in the Asian countries affected.19",

Thereafter, human rights crop up in a number of articles. Article 42, for example, provides that all health measures must be applied in a transparent and non-discriminatory way. Informed consent and information privacy feature in several articles, including Article 23 which provides that States Parties must not apply health measures such as vaccination, medical examination or isolation to international travellers without \u2018prior express informed consent\u2019, save in circumstances where there is \u2018evidence of an imminent public health risk\u2019.38 Article 45(1) provides that States Parties must treat personal health information in a confidential manner \u2018as required by national law\u2019. More generally, the new IHR feature requirements concerning any limitations on rights that are familiar from international human rights law. So, for example, WHO recommendations to States Parties, and health measures implemented by States Parties in response to identifiable risks, must be \u2018no more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection\u2019.39 The IHR also give WHO a new power to use information about disease outbreaks provided by unofficial sources (for example, non-governmental organisations or individual scientists).40 Significantly, WHO has described this new power as a \u2018revolutionary departure from previous international conventions and regulations\u2019.41",

The catalyst for this was the announcement by an Australian pharmaceutical company that it had developed a vaccine and could manufacture enough to protect the Australian public within six months. The company was one of a number that had received Indonesian samples from WHO.

This movement encompasses two different approaches to public health and human rights, one that forthrightly acknowledges the potential tension between public health necessity and human rights, and another that rejects the assumption of such a tension and instead sees the pursuit of public health and human rights as inextricably linked. One consequence of this has been vigorous intra-movement debate about the extent and inevitability of conflicts and trade-offs between public health and liberty.50 This debate is both inevitable and deeply useful, but there is a problem in that, in an \u2018age of preparedness\u2019, robust debate amongst rights advocates about the pros and cons of trade-offs could be read in a way that puts rights at risk.",

The hype, or \u2018myth\u2019, of rights is a claim that is familiar from empirical socio-legal work on rights. Problems with rights have also been emphasised by rights-sceptics.51 The point though is that, lately, a new link between human rights and risk has emerged, largely as a result of post 9/11 rhetoric about life in a \u2018time of crisis\u2019. Its position, in crude terms, is that exceptional times mandate exceptional measures to deal with risk. As Liora Lazarus and Benjamin Goold have pointed out, \u2018the idea that certain human rights can be \u201cturned off\u201d when necessary\u2019 has acquired remarkable power; it is now widely regarded as a \u2018thoroughly reasonable reaction to the dangers allegedly faced by democratic societies\u2019.52 And, as they go on to emphasise:\nthe exceptionalism argument has become pivotal, so much so that liberals and human rights organisations must either rebut claims that our conditions are unique, or respond to these supposedly exceptional conditions by adjusting our institutions, practices, procedures and laws.53\nIn this environment, human rights advocates debating the relationship between public health and human rights need to be extremely careful.54",

For the linkage-sceptic, the hope that has been invested in the idea of a \u2018right to security\u2019 is misplaced, not least because this right could take shape as an argument against human rights. Think, for example, of the claim that human rights are no more than a tool used and abused by \u2018minorities\u2019, especially \u2018dangerous, violent minorities\u2019. This tends to be accompanied by another claim: namely, it is the right to security of \u2018law-abiding, decent people\u2019 to live safe and secure from crime and violence that has been neglected and needs shoring up.55 Moreover, these claims do not crop up only in the context of terrorism. As Jonathan Montgomery has pointed out, in the UK, discussions on the criminalisation of disease transmission have been fed by metaphors of disease carriers \u2018as markedly different from \u201cnormal\u201d members of society\u2019, encouraging \u2018people to think of the transmission of disease as the province of evil criminals, not people like them\u2019. Specifically:\nThose being prosecuted are [now] demonized less for their disease status than as sexual predators, and coverage shows a strong racial overtone. \u2026 AIDS is no longer presented as a gay plague but an African one. Even more clearly the protection of victims from aggressors has emerged as the rationale for criminalization, obscuring public health issues. The innocence of the victims and the evil of the aggressor are stressed.56\nIn our view, the sceptic's argument makes a great deal of sense. Put bluntly, amidst the new \u2018rights revolution\u2019, which is characterised by a defensiveness in human rights advocacy and, its correlate, an anti-rights sentiment that queries the legitimacy of rights in a time of alleged crisis, there are no guarantees that the securitisation of public health, the right to security or human security will be good for human rights.57 Moreover, we know from history that, in the past, terrible abuses have been committed in the name of public health.58 We have a potential problem, however, because in addition to agreeing with the sceptic's argument, we also agree with at least some of the optimist's argument. In particular, we cannot see how being \u2018against security\u2019 is a viable stance.

The terminology of risk was not widely used in the past, but analysing how threats to public health could be dealt with in a manner compatible with the normative frameworks of human rights instruments is an exercise that should be familiar to human rights lawyers. International instruments, including the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), enable States Parties to derogate from certain human rights in the event of public emergencies that threaten \u2018the life of the nation\u2019.61 At other times, limitations on non-absolute rights are permitted, provided certain conditions are met. For example, interference with Article 8 ECHR on the right to privacy is justified if it is legally prescribed, serves a legitimate purpose and can be proved to be \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019. For the European Court of Human Rights, the principle of proportionality is a key component of the latter \u2018democratic necessity\u2019 test.62 More broadly, although the intensity of review in individual contexts (for example, interference with the right to liberty or privacy), and the exact legal terminology and method used, will differ, common judicial approaches towards questions of justification or necessity can be found across jurisdictions.63 It is simply not correct therefore to claim that human rights law fails to deal with risk, or that a choice always has to be made between risk and rights. It is possible to identify\u2014through the structure and interpretive principles of human rights instruments\u2014the means to mediate the relationship between risk and rights.

Instead, it was for the most part accepted as an uncontroversial component of the expert, scientific evidence put forward in support of one's legal arguments.65 But a change has taken place due to the new societal emphasis on (in)security and public protection. Significantly, in some jurisdictions, the new post 9/11 national security context has generated strong demand for greater prioritisation of risk66\u2014even if this comes at the expense of established human rights norms.67 The risk and rights relationship, in other words, is being framed as risk or rights\u2014and rights seem to be at a substantial disadvantage. There is though a new critical counter-terrorism scholarship which is fighting this dangerous turn. In our view, its arguments need to be read very closely by those working on public health emergency preparedness, not least because of the effect that a \u2018risk or rights\u2019 approach could have on the interpretation, and use, of the IHR and the design, interpretation and use of national preparedness measures.",

For example, the use of coercive measures\u2014such as quarantine\u2014requires particularly strong justification. These measures infringe liberty and privacy rights and, if mistakes are made, healthy individuals are put at serious risk of infection. The threat of quarantine can lead individuals to delay seeking diagnosis and treatment. It can also provoke or compound discrimination and stigmatisation of particular individuals and groups. And, as Lucia Zedner has pointed out, the use of risk categories to target certain groups can create a further problem:\nAt one level, it makes perfect sense to target security measures at those deemed most to threaten. Yet an inherent danger of selectivity is that precisely because it imposes restrictions only on targeted sections of the population, it is less likely to invoke the natural political resistance generated by burdens that affect us all.70\nCritical counter-terrorism scholarship should also be seen as relevant in developing an account of risk-based evidence and its relationship to human rights. Some public health commentators, discussing coercive measures, have begun to advocate a direct linkage between risk expertise and human rights standards:\nAn approach, which might enable the formulation of a body of public health ethics acceptable to human rights jurisprudence is to introduce into the language of ethics and rights the notion of evidence-based assessment of risk.71\nThis approach, they argue, could help to bring consistency and coherence to the \u2018balancing [of] the common public health good with individual rights\u2019.72 For this to be true, critical counter-terrorism scholarship suggests that two particular problems will need to be addressed: the first concerns the terminology of balance; the second concerns the nature and role of risk-based evidence in legal processes.",

It uses a \u2018utilitarian analysis of the rights and public interest goals in question, giving no significantly greater weight to rights than to security measures\u2019.74 Proportionality, in contrast, is more protective of human rights: specifically, under the proportionality approach, there is a presumption that rights restrict public interest goals. Rights outweigh goals that are not legitimate and, where goals are legitimate, any measures giving effect to them must be suitable, the least restrictive possible, and proportionate between the effects of the measures and the objectives to be achieved.75",

Historically, many types of expert evidence pertaining to public or national security were viewed as non-justiciable. And, where judicial intervention did occur, the actual level of scrutiny was often minimal and deferential to government assertions and experts.77 Today, however, what we have labelled as \u2018risk within rights\u2019 is beginning to be openly articulated by the judiciary in security contexts. Specifically, in some jurisdictions, in response to concerns about the nature, and direction, of recent anti-terrorism legislation and practice\u2014including preventative detention, surveillance and deportation of suspected individuals\u2014judges have started to engage openly, and more critically, with the relationship between risk and human rights.78 This is a welcome development.

Furthermore, for an organisation, risks exist in both engaging with, and rejecting, human rights. Michael Likosky, discussing the imperative of governments and private companies to manage human rights risks in joint projects, emphasises that organisations' risk-mitigation strategies will vary. For example:\nDo they address the underlying human rights problem itself, making a project more respectful of human rights? Do they discredit the NGO or community group campaign? Do they negotiate with one NGO but not with another? Do they assuage the concerns of the NGOs and community groups by adopting guidelines? Do they adopt binding or nonbinding measures? Do they establish commissions to review human rights practices of specific projects?83\nIn the public health emergency field, a wide range of influences, demands and obligations have the capacity to lead to the construction of rights as a risk. Indeed, the cross-sector and cross-jurisdiction nature of public health emergencies (especially those of \u2018international concern\u2019) creates an especially complex governance landscape: distinct histories, cultures and agendas will be colliding in times of crisis when immediate responses are expected.

One federal public health official has speculated that:\nThe belief that the decisions about SARS by senior public officials, provided that they had a legal basis, would be made fairly was so deeply ingrained among the public that there was little need to question or scrutinize those decisions.91\nJacobs's explanation for the non-use of courts is that legal avenues of redress might not be seen as appropriate \u2018where the health security of the community is at stake\u2019.92 From an organisational risk perspective, this phenomenon could be used as a reason to dismiss rights as a risk and, more specifically, to downgrade the need for rights protection in preparedness planning and implementation. This, however, would be counter-productive. As James Childress and Ruth Gaare Bernheim have argued, \u2018public justification, deliberation, and other relationship-building activities may be more important for biopreparedness than state power because they maintain and nurture civic ideals, cooperation, and trust\u2019.93 Moreover, Childress and Gaare Bernheim's argument can be extended to encompass the role of the private sector in sustaining public trust during an emergency.

The extent of internalisation of human rights within WHO is, therefore, crucial. Little, however, is known about this as the Organization has not been the focus of human rights or, indeed, regulation scholarship.95 But it is obvious that the range of internal staff responses will play a significant role in the design, implementation and monitoring of any human rights-based policies. We can also speculate that any internal divisions on human rights will both increase WHO's own exposure to organisational risk and affect the handling of the specific human rights matter in question. Consider, for example, Galit Sarfaty's study of interpretations of human rights at the World Bank. Comparing World Bank investment projects relating to HIV/AIDS prevention in Russia and Saint Lucia, Sarfaty speculates on the reasons why different framings of the human rights dimension were adopted in each case:\nOne reason may be that the project team was dominated by staff who prefer a cost-benefit analysis to a legal approach, and who concluded that funds would be better spent on other preventative projects. \u2026 The Russian Government [also] treats the human rights of [Persons Living With HIV/AIDS] as a sensitive, politically-charged issue that it would prefer to avoid. Even if the Saint Lucian Government took the same view, Russia holds much more influence than Saint Lucia over Bank project design because it is a major borrower and not a country that the Bank wants to upset.96\nShe also highlights two different core approaches to human rights among World Bank staff: she labels the first \u2018instrumental\u2019 and the second \u2018intrinsic\u2019. Staff who adopt an intrinsic framework draw on either moral or legal imperatives and, overall, they see human rights in normative terms as an end in themselves.

Perhaps this is one reason why they have drawn so much attention. \u2026 No doubt there are other explanations, too, for the apparent assumption that devoting resources to pandemic planning is just. \u2026 Nonetheless, there are serious questions of justice to be asked about the allocation of extensive resources to pandemic threats.98\nAnd, as they go on to point out, questions concerning the \u2018justice of\u2019 and \u2018justice within\u2019 pandemic planning are not unrelated. Put shortly, if basic health care infrastructure is in a state of neglect or unavailable, if health professionals are in short supply or are not trusted by the population, and if there is inequality in access to primary care, then global surveillance, surge capacity and, more generally, preventing and coping with a pandemic will be all the more difficult. \u2018Pandemic myopia\u2019, in other words, is a seriously flawed approach to pandemic planning99\u2014which is surely something that human rights advocates (whether they see themselves as \u2018risk strategists\u2019 or not) need to be arguing as strongly and clearly as possible.",

Being \u2018at the table\u2019, if that course is chosen, is not likely to be at all easy in practice. The counter-argument to this is that human rights advocacy has always been complex.100 Think, for example, of the diversity of human rights advocates (such as the US Christian Right at the United Nations using human rights to argue against rights to sexual and reproductive health).101 And it cannot be denied that human rights \u2018victories\u2019 have sometimes had unexpected, negative consequences: on occasion, they have been used by governments as a basis from which to claim that action has been taken and no further governmental action is required. It can also be argued that if deeper engagement with human rights by governments and other organisations (even if primarily through the lens of risk management) is a significant contemporary dynamic, then human rights advocates have little choice but to respond in some fashion. And it should not be forgotten that risk-based indicators and compliance strategies have also been growing areas of interest within human rights work.102 Lastly, there is, of course, the possibility that an organisation that starts out with an instrumentalist mindset towards human rights might ultimately internalise them to beneficial effect. Overall, then, human rights advocates should not\u2014and probably cannot\u2014avoid engaging with rights as risk.",

It is likely that it will also be read, at least by some, as a rebuke to individuals, like us, who set out to critique preparedness when it is currently so precarious in practice.",

Who, in the end, would choose to be \u2018against preparedness\u2019\u2014especially when one considers the extreme human costs of recent public health emergencies? We are not against it, however. Our argument throughout has been that critique is essential to preparedness and that, to date, critique from a human rights perspective has been in short supply. We have suggested a preliminary agenda to address the human rights gap, focusing in particular on the frames \u2018risk within rights\u2019 and \u2018rights as risk\u2019, and we assigned the name \u2018human rights preparedness\u2019 to the project as a whole. We concluded by turning inwards, emphasising that this project carries risks for human rights itself. Specifically, critiquing preparedness could well involve self-critique as human rights advocacy works towards a more differentiated analysis of how security should be engaged and what it means to do human rights today. Putting that another way, human rights preparedness\u2014and, in particular, engagement with \u2018rights as risk\u2019\u2014is likely to be human rights without a safety net.",
