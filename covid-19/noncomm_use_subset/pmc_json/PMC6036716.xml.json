            "text": "PCR (polymerase Chain Reaction) was first invented by Kary Mullis and his colleagues from the Cetus Corporation when they exploited the ability of Taq polymerase from Thermus Aquaticus, which amplifies DNA, to withstand elevated temperatures. In reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), RNA is first reverse transcribed into cDNA and then amplified. The first generation of RT-PCR uses a band's intensity in gel for a semi-quantification.8 Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (real-time qRT-PCR) and digital PCR were then developed. Instead of detecting how much PCR product is generated (conventional PCR), qRT-PCR counts how many reaction cycles are used to reach an amplification slope status in real-time. The Ct (cycle threshold) levels, defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold (i.e. exceeds background level) are inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample (i.e. the lower the Ct level, the greater the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample). The first step requires reverse transcription of the mRNA template. Then, a primer pair anneals to the target cDNA template and a DNA polymerase (e.g. Taq) extends from the ligated primers. A thermal cycler varies the temperature settings to perform the three stages of the PCR: denaturation, annealing, and extension. Finally, a standard dissociation curve can be studied to determine the initial amount of RNA (cDNA) transcripts.9,10",

A range of Tms have been reported, with 58\u02da~60\u02daC considered as stringent. Tight annealing of the primer to the mRNA template will reduce the chances of primer-dimers or hairpins.11,12 Lastly, primers spanning exon-exon junctions allow for the strict amplification of mRNA samples and not any contaminating DNA as DNA contains alternating regions of exons and introns while mRNA lacks introns.11 There are a few freeware to help the primer/probe design, for example Primer3, the primer designing tool from NCBI.",

            "text": "Many commercial companies provide qRT-PCR Taq polymerase enzyme and mixture reaction solutions. Besides the digital PCR that detects the actual copy of mRNAs and other alternative PCR methods, there are two major qRT-PCR systems: TaqMan and SYBR green. In TaqMan qRT-PCR, a specific probe labeled with a fluorescent reporter is bound on the cDNA of the target RNA. Taq polymerase enzyme will degrade the probes during the chain extension such that the fluorescent reporter is released. The amount of PCR product can be quantitatively measured by the fluorescence reporter detection.10 As different reporter dyes can be utilized for a TaqMan assay, the sensitivity of a TaqMan assay is one of its major advantages. It also has a high specificity because of the specific probe but it cannot be used for multiplex gene targets. In SYBR Green qRT-PCR, the fluorescent dye SYBR Green binds with the amplified double stranded DNA and emits an intense green light. Therefore, the PCR products can be measured by detecting the bound SYBR Green fluorescence. Compared to TaqMan qRT-PCR, this method is inexpensive, easy to use, and can be used for multiplex gene targets. However, due to its ability to bind to any double-stranded DNA, nonspecific binding can lead to over quantification of PCR product.9,13",

There are two types of DNA microarray: 2-channel and 1-channel arrays. In 2-channel array, the array slides are made by spotting with cDNA fragments (custom cDNA array) or oligonucleotide probes (Agilent). The treated sample's cDNA and the normal control sample's cDNA are labeled by two types of fluorescence(2-channel). For example, cDNA from tumor samples may be labeled with Cy\u00ae5 while cDNA from normal tissue samples may be labeled with Cy\u00ae3.The mixture of treated and control samples are then hybridized on array. The ratio of the 2-channel intensities of each spot represents the gene expression of treated sample relative to control. Now Agilent produces commercial 2-channel arrays.24,25 In 1-channel array, the oligonucleotide probes are synthesized on the surface of slide. The fluorescent labeled sample cDNAs are then hybridized on the array and the absolute intensity of hybridization signal is measured. Affymetrix GeneChip is a typical 1-channel array.24, 26 Illumina BeadArray is a variation of 1-channel array which synthesizes barcoded probes on a surface of microbeads and makes cells filled with beads.27 A DNA microarray assay needs a commercial array or custom designed array and cDNA labelling preparation from each RNA sample. Following hybridization of the cDNA samples on array, a scanning device images and measures the fluorescent levels of the microarray.",

However, the number of proteins to be detected is limited by the antibodies.68,69 TMAs are expanded from gene expression serial analysis and cDNA microarrays so that they only require a single experiment to study the gene expression from many genes in a single tumor sample, allowing multiple patient samples representing various stages of a disease to be simultaneously investigated.70 With the use of a TMA slide, probes for hybridization, and a signal detection instrument or scanner for data, followed by data analysis, TMAs offer the advantage of permitting a single set of tissues with associated clinical data to be used in various and unlimited studies. The steps generally required to prepare a TMA are as follows: preparation of a high-adhesive glass slide; acquisition of donor tissues; tissue core mapping and arrangement; sampling, sectioning, and transferring of the tissue donor cores; and tissue staining and molecular analysis. First, samples are taken from FFPE tissues. After mapping a tissue section stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E), a tissue arrayer removes cores from the donor block and places them in the recipient block.",

The protocols used for RNA extraction and sample purification, data acquisition and normalization, type and construction of probes, and the methods of labelling and hybridization used greatly affect the reproducibility of DNA microarrays.83,84 Numerous studies have confirmed the reproducibility of the NanoString nCounter platform due to its requirement of little input RNA and lack of a reverse transcription step. For example, its reproducibility has been demonstrated using diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), gastric, pancreas, xenograft, lung, breast, blood, and melanoma samples, while a separate study demonstrated inter-laboratory (Canada, Switzerland, and the United Stated) reproducibility of nCounter with medulloblastoma samples. 42,85,86 Similarly, studies have used techniques such as PCR, qRT-PCR, and microarrays to show the MiSeq platform and RNA-Seq to be reproducible.87,88,89,90 For example, the SEQC/MAQC-III Consortium have demonstrated RNA-Seq to have a >80% validation with quantitative PCR (qPCR) when sequencing unannotated exon-exon junctions, yet microarrays do not provide reliable reproducibility data.89 One of the greatest drawbacks of TMAs is the tumor inter-heterogeneity - the fact that a single spot punched from a tumor block is not representative of the rest of the tumor. Regardless, TMAs have a high degree of reproducibility due to the maximum 1000 spots on a single slide simultaneously being sampled and subjected to an experimental test using the same reagents. Multiple punches can be sampled from one tumor block, allowing for the same tumor block to be used in multiple experiments; for example, TMAs from one recipient block can be distributed between labs. Immunohistochemical and FISH tests can then be standardized for reproducible results.91",

For example, TMAs can array up to 1000 different sample spots on a single array, allowing 0.6 mm as the smallest sample size that can be taken with efficient detection results; in situ hybridization is shown to have a sensitivity of 10-20 mRNA copies per cell.67,68,96",

As previously discussed, a strict design is required to ensure the qRT-PCR primer tightly anneals to the mRNA transcript and amplifies only the section of interest. Therefore, the specificity of qRT-PCR depends on the forward and reverse primer design, as well as the oligonucleotide probe used in detection.11,12,97 The specificity of DNA microarrays depends on a number of factors, such as the density of probes annealed to the slide, the single probe (hybridization of a probe to a single target), single spot (a spot of multiple probes may contain probes that are perfectly or partially hybridized to a target), and spot-set (multiple spots represent different sections of the same sequence).98 Similar to PCR, the specificity may also depend on the probe design; for example, cDNA microarrays can employ probes up to a few thousand base pairs in length while oligonucleotide arrays perform best with shorter probes that can be 25-30mer or 60-70mer in length.83 The specificity of NanoString nCounter is due to its target-specific Capture and Reporter probes, as these are designed to anneal to a nucleic acid region of interest. These combine with the internal controls used to form the CodeSet, which confers the overall specificity.99 TMA quality is dependent on the type of analysis being done. For example, FISH, RNA FISH, and immunohistochemistry each confer different specificities to the TMA assay.100,101 RNA probes about 250-1500 nucleotides in length, with a common recommendation of 800 nucleotides, tend to demonstrate high specificity.102 Chemically-synthesized oligonucleotides labelled with fluorophores and calibrated to a certain region tend to generate RNA FISH probes with high specificity.100",

It therefore may depend on the number of genes that can be detected by a technique and/or the number of samples that can be processed. Well-plates that can hold a maximum of 384 samples can be purchased for PCR. Although control samples (tests priming the housekeeping genes) and all replicates (a recommended number of three) should be run on a single plate, a qRT-PCR assay has the potential to assess 384 samples at once. This substantial number of wells also allow for the analyses of a few hundred genes in Singleplex reactions.12,103 The number of samples analyzed on a DNA microarray can depend on the purpose of the microarray and the number of genes being assessed. Whole-genome arrays can be performed for an individual or a small number of individuals can be simultaneously analyzed for a certain set of genes on one array. For example, Prosigna is able to assess up to 8 breast cancer patient samples for 1900 features on a single array.104,105 It has been reported that up to 50 000 different probes are available for detections on a microarray, with each detection representing a different gene.106 The nCounter has the capacity to input 12 samples and detect 800 genes.107 Approximately 1000 genes can be targeted and 96 samples can be processed using the MiSeq benchtop sequencer; clusters of about 1000 molecules or 1536 amplicons can be generated from a single transcript and anywhere from 700 to thousands of targets have been reported.108, 109 Similar to DNA microarrays, the number of samples assessed and genes detected on the TMA depends on its purpose. Generally, 1000 spots representing different samples can be arrayed on a TMA.67,68 Although many genes have the ability to be detected as different coloured probes can be designed to anneal to their target region, studies tend to depict 1-3 genes using fluorescent detection on a TMA.74,75,76,77 This may be because resolution can be difficult using many different probes in an in situ detection assay.",

            "text": "A qRT-PCR reaction per sample can be considered cheap in cost. Various kits can be obtained according to one's experimental design to reverse transcribe the mRNA to cDNA and carry out the remainder qRT-PCR steps for about $300-$550. According to BioSearch Technologies, after all reagent costs have been accounted for, a single qRT-PCR reaction totals under $1.00. When probes are being used as the detection method, the total cost is about $0.82 per reaction; when SYBR is being used, the total cost is about $0.56 per reaction. These increase to about $0.89 and $1.13 if probes and SYBR are being used, respectively, when additional targets are present.110 A sample processing of $0.50 has been reported. A qRT-PCR reaction per sample has been reported to cost as little as $0.50 per reaction.111 A whole microarray slide can cost between $150-$400, with a full genome array being $500, and a processing cost of about $325 per array. Some studies have reported a cost of $0.025 per data point (or gene being analyzed).111,112 The NanoString nCounter provides a Master Kit and CodeSet to be purchased separately, with all necessary consumables and reagents. The Master Kit costs about $280-350 per 1 cartridge for 12 samples.113 Custom or pre-designed CodeSets are available for specific gene detection. Pre-designed CodeSets can be purchased for $3600-$4800 per 12 assays for analyzing samples of human stem cells, human cancer reference, or leukemia, to name a few. A custom CodeSet for 48 assays assessing 25 genes can cost about $6000, resulting in a cost of $125 per assay and $5 per data point. Doubling the target to 50 genes nearly doubles the cost to $10 000 for 48 assays, $208.33 per assay, and $4.17 per data point.114 Several institutes provide services to carry out an nCounter experiment for up to $530 (University of Kentucky and the Whitehead Institute) per cartridge of 12.112,113 A sample processing for targeted gene sequencing costs $90 on the MiSeq Benchtop sequencer, with a 50-500 base pair sequencing kit valued at $1400-$2000.115,116 Some institutes provide data analysis for $160-$175.116,117 Prepared tissue microarrays may cost as much as $6000 (stage I breast cancer tissue array).118 Studies have reported the cost to build and analyze a TMA to be $255 (18 cases) and $12 240 (48 cases), resulting to $12.50 per case.119 In addition, the instruments are valued at $25 000-$95 000 (thermal cycler for PCR), $50 000-$110 000 (microarray scanner), $235 000-$285 000 (NanoString Prep Station and Digital Analyzer), $128 000 (MiSeq Benchtop sequencer), and $55 000-$98 000 (tissue arrayers), respectively.9,120,121,122,123,124,125",

Following RNA extraction, qRT-PCR requires the mixing of various reagents before allowing the sample to reverse transcribe. A well-plate must be carefully prepared prior to subjecting the sample for the PCR and dissociation curve analysis steps in the thermal cycler machine and by the computer, respectively; this can take about 5 hours when including an RNA extraction step. Similarly, DNA microarrays require a reverse transcription step after the RNA extraction. Time is then required to allow the sample to hybridize to the array; the arrays can be pre-ordered and do not have to be constructed in the laboratory. The microarray scanner analyzes and slides and computer software can be purchased for data analysis, resulting in a total time of 20 hours.126 NanoString nCounter only requires the user to prepare the initial sample and then transfer the sample to and from the Prep Station and Digital Analyzer machines. The machines carry out any processing and data analysis that needs to be done, resulting in a total of about 5.5 hours.107 Similar to the nCounter, Illumina MiSeq only requires the user to prepare the library and load it onto the reagent cartridge; the rest of the sample processing and data analysis is carried out by the MiSeq benchtop sequencer, with the MiSeq Reporter analysis software launching following completion of the trial. A total of about 40 hours is required.115 TMA construction is a tedious procedure and therefore requires the most work, demanding an average of up to two days, depending on the exact procedure followed. If donor tissue blocks are not available, one must collect samples prior to preparing the block. Then, slides of the tissue sample must be stained so that one can use the tissue arrayer to accurately remove cores from the donor block and place them on the slide. Following construction of the slide, reagents for FISH, ISH, or immunohistochemistry tests must be prepared and applied to the slide. The slides can then be analyzed by eye or with a (digital) slide scanner.127",

Cost-effectiveness studies may be performed on an assay to determine its economic utility for a consumer's and society's well-being.6,128 New biomarkers may undergo cost-utility studies measured in sum of money per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, where the ratio of the cost of a test to its benefits in the number of years gained is taken. $50 000 USD per QALY gained is considered the upper-limit for cost-effectiveness.126 In addition to the necessity of developing an assay with low cost, the FDA guidelines for approval must be met. Once FDA-approved, it is then up to clinicians to accept and employ the assay.6",
