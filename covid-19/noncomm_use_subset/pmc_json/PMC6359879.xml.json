The near-isogenic line BC9 (LC50 = 2.27 \u00d7 106) was constructed according to protocol of Wang et al. (2017). In brief, susceptible strain P50 were crossed with resistant strain A35, and progeny was repeatedly backcrossed with the P50 for nine generations, and each progeny was screened with BmNPV. Hence, the genetic background of BC9 is much similar to the P50, but BC9 should have the resistant background derived from A35. All larvae were reared as described previously (Yu et al. 2017b). Briefly, fresh mulberry leaves were used to feed larvae. The first- to third-instar larvae were raised in artificial climate chamber at temperature 26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with relative humidity of 75 \u00b1 5% at 12 h day/night cycles, and temperature 24 \u00b1 1\u00b0C was used for fourth- and fifth-instar larvae with the same relative humidity and photoperiod as mentioned previously.",

To measure the quantity of all DNA samples, a spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, NY) was used. To check the purity of all DNA samples, A260/280 and A260/230 absorbance ratio was used, and 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the integrity of DNA. The GP41 primer was showed in Table 1.

Midgut tissues were obtained at 48 h postinfection of BmNPV. Using genomic DNA extraction kit, the isolation of genomic DNA was performed (TaKaRa). Three BmNPV GP41, IE-1, and GP64 genes were analyzed in B. mori midgut by RT-qPCR.",

Melting curve analysis confirmed that specific amplification was achieved using a pair of primers against the BmNPV GP41 gene. In the early stage after BmNPV infection (0\u20136 h), BmNPV proliferation was nearly undetected in the midgut-hypodermic injection and midgut-oral infection (Fig. 1). As the infection progressed, BmNPV copy numbers increased significantly from 13.9 to 1,746.7 within 6\u201348 h in the susceptible P50 midgut injected. In contrast, the BmNPV proliferation rate was low in the resistant BC9 midgut injected, which slowly increased to 683.2 at 48 hpi and 11,210.8 at 72 hpi. In the midgut oral, the relative copy numbers of GP41 showed a similar pattern. The BmNPV copy numbers increased from 82.2 to 8,178.0 within 6\u201348 hpi in the susceptible P50. However, in resistant BC9, BmNPV proliferation was significantly slower with the relative copy number increasing from 6.5 to 2,216.2 within 6\u201348 hpi (Fig. 1). These results indicated that viral proliferation was faster in midgut oral than in midgut injected. In addition, we also found that 48 hpi was critical time point when BmNPV copy numbers showed a significant difference between resistant strain BC9 and susceptible stain P50.",

The activation of MAPKs depends on phosphorylation of certain motifs found in activation loop. The p38 MAPK and S6K are important proteins of MAPK family. Evidence showed that p38 MAPK and S6K play vital role in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Roux and Blenis 2004, Fenton and Gout 2011). However, studies on p38 and S6K MAPK proteins in silkworm had not been reported previously. Therefore, in the present study, we identified B. mori p38 and S6K proteins from iTRAQ database. The sequence analysis showed that Bmp38 and BmS6K contain S_TKc domain with 360 aa and 753 aa, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of Bmp38 and BmS6k with other organisms (having known functions) revealed common features in all of them, e.g., activation loop and motifs. The phylogenetic analysis provided evidences that Bmp38 and BmS6K homologous are highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. This phylogenetic analysis is consistent with the previous studies (Lin et al. 2017, Yu et al. 2017c).",

In Drosophila, the p38 MAPK participate in host defense and protect Drosophila form injury caused by pathogens (Chen et al. 2010). A p38 MAPK from Litopenaeus vannamei gene expression showed upregulation when challenged with pathogens (Yan et al. 2013). Studies have shown that p38 MAPK participates in viral replication in in vito (Johnson et al. 2000, Khatri and Sharma 2006). In this study, to determine Bmp38 can participate in immune response of B. mori, we analyzed Bmp38 expression after BmNPV infection. Our study results showed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the midgut, followed by the hemolymph after BmNPV infection. The expression in different silkworm strains showed that Bmp38 expression was upregulated in BC9 (resistant strain) than P50 (susceptible strain). The translation data confirmed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the BC9 than in the P50. We also observed the expression of Bmp38 in the midgut post-BmNPV infection. The results showed that Bmp38 expression was upregulated in P50+ and BC9+ than control. Moreover, expression in the BC9 was higher than P50 after BmNPV infection. Immunoblot results confirmed that Bmp38 expression was higher in the BC9 than in the P50. These findings are in accordance with our previous iTRAQ database (Yu et al. 2017b). Similar evidence from different organisms showed p38 MAPK signaling pathway mRNA expression was increased after pathogen infection (He et al. 2013, 2018; Yan et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2014). A p38 protein from Scylla paramamosain showed that it is involved in immune response against bacteria and virus (Yu et al. 2017c). These findings suggest that Bmp38 may be involved in immune response against BmNPV.",

The study on S6K in Drosophila suggests that disruption of S6K cause the death of flies at the larvae and pupa stage (Montagne et al. 1999). To date, there are no reports on S6K functions against pathogens. We observed the transcription and translation level of B. mori S6K. Our results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the hemolymph and midgut after BmNPV infection. The translation results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the head, followed by the fat body. The transcription results of BmS6K in the midgut after BmNPV infection revealed that BmS6K expression was at peak at 12 h postinfection, then its expression decreased slightly at 24, 48, and 72 h, but it was still significantly upregulated. The translation data also correlate with the transcription data. Moreover, we found that BmS6K translation data are somewhat consistent with the iTRAQ and need further attention.",

The results indicated that Bmp38 blocking increased the relative copy numbers of viral genes when compared with control. It has been reported that silence of p38 from Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) revealed its role against white spot syndrome virus (He et al. 2018). Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 affected the replication of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (Marchant et al. 2010). Therefore, we speculated that Bmp38 might be involved in BmNPV resistance. The RSK family comprised a group of highly related serine/threonine kinases that regulated diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, cell growth, and motility. Members of RSK family contained RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, and RSK4. Among them, activated RSK2 was shown to phosphorylate several transcription factors response to viral infection (Yan et al. 2018). Surviladze et al. (2013) revealed that activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR could phosphorylate S6K to further activate the downstream signal pathways in response to human papillomavirus type 16 infection. In case of BmS6K, the relative copy numbers of viral genes were significantly upregulated than CK. We considered that BmNPV resistance of BmS6K required phosphorylation modification. Therefore, the specific reasons need to be conducted. The abovementioned results suggested that blocking of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 (resistant strain) might participate in BmNPV proliferation.",
