The Korea Immigration Service Statistics reported that the number of domestic travelers increased from 27,397,000 in 2013 to 40,249,000 in 2017 [1]. This has raised public awareness over communicable diseases such as influenza (H1N1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), shigellosis, and outbreaks of avian influenza infections in humans in China, leading to concerns over management of these diseases in Korea [2,3]. The identification and quarantine of infected people may prevent the spread of communicable diseases, but latency of illness, lack of traveler information and route of travel make this difficult to control on a large scale [4,5].",

Travelers\u2019 diarrhea is a symptom of eating infected food and to a lesser extent drinking unclean water [14,15]. Globally, 30\u201370% of travelers experience diarrhea during travel, and usually have bacterial pathogens such as E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp. These are major causes of diarrhea symptoms in travelers [16,17].",
