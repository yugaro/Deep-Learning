            "text": "Evolution occurs through natural selection. The evolutionary rate of change of viruses is much higher than that of other micro-organisms. Due to the high frequency of viral mutation and reproduction, the ability of viruses to escape from host immune proteasomal degradation is difficult to predict. Although numerous studies have identified viral immune escape mechanisms [1,2], there is insufficient evidence to fully define these mechanisms in detail. One reason for this lack of evidence is that viruses mutate so rapidly that the mutational site cannot be determined. If a virus mutates into a form that is more easily spread between humans, it can cause a pandemic [3]. Instances of such recently emerged VIDs (viral infectious diseases) include HIV/AIDS [4], SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) [5] and avian influenza virus (H1N1 and H5N1) [6,7]. In general, each of the latter deadly infectious diseases has been caused by new or mutated viruses from distant organisms. For example, HIV came from the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) [4], SARS from the common palm civet [5] and avian influenza virus from birds [6,7]. From chimpanzees to civets to birds, these natural hosts diverge farther away from humans, yet all of these virulent viruses have crossed the species barrier to invade humans. It is important to speculate from which distant species a new virus will emerge to invade humans in the next disaster. Such a virus may be from a plant, whose origin is even more distant from humans. Due to the pressure of natural selection and human exploration in the biosphere, it is possible for a plant virus to evolve the ability to invade the human body as its \u2018fresh\u2019 host, regardless of whether it has a specific receptor on human cellular membranes.",

            "text": "In our study, we chose one of the most widely studied positive-strand RNA plant viruses, the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus), as the model for the next potential infectious virus [8]. In addition to having the ability to infect plant hosts, especially tobacco [9], previous reports have shown that TMV-prosomes can be detected in vertebrate cells and animal cells, which suggests that TMV has the ability to cross species. For instance, Knowland showed that RNA from TMV can be translated inside oocytes of the frog, Xenopus laevis [10]; Salomon and Bar-Joseph [11] reported that RNA from both TMV strains were likely translated in rabbit reticulocytes; and Dimitriadis and Georgatsos [12] indicated that synthesis of the TMV CP (coat protein) followed the migration of viral RNA into isolated mouse liver mitochondria. These studies prompted us to investigate whether TMV-RNA has biological activity in human cells. Studies to date have been limited not only to the study of plant infection but also to other species. However, increasing evidence has indicated that some viruses can cross species [3,13]. Herein, we tested the novel idea that TMV might evolve to invade human cells.",

The replication of TMV-RNA in tobacco protoplasts is similar to that of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, and it takes place in two stages; first, synthesis of a minus strand using the viral plus strand RNA as a template is followed by synthesis of progeny plus strands using the minus strand as a template. Secondly, the negative strand acts as a template for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs for the MP (movement protein) and the CP [8]. The MP RNA is produced transiently, whereas the replicase and CP RNAs are produced constitutively during infection [14]. CP regulates the formation of replication complexes during TMV infection [15] and it has been highly conserved during evolution in contrast with other TMV proteins that vary from species to species [16]. In previous studies, CP has been shown to be produced in the frog X. laevis, in rabbit reticulocytes and in mouse liver mitochondria [10\u201312].",

            "text": "Autophagy is a conserved pathway that functions in all eukaryotic organisms to maintain cellular homoeostasis. The autophagy pathway targets both cellular cytoplasmic constituents (such as damaged or surplus organelles, proteins and protein aggregates) for lysosomal degradation as well as microbial invaders (including viruses). Molecular steps are required for autophagosomal formation that involves a double-layered vesicle that fuses with a lysosome to digest the material inside the vacuole [17]. It is known that viral infection of a cell may stimulate autophagy [18]. Ubiquitin-like LC3 (light-chain protein 3) has been used as a specific marker for the autophagosomal compartment. Two forms of LC3, the cytosolic LC3-I and the membrane-bound LC3-II, are produced post-translationally. LC3-I is formed by the removal of the C-terminal 22 amino acids from newly synthesized LC3, followed by the conversion of a fraction of LC3-I into LC3-II. The induction of autophagy leads to the processing of LC3-I into LC3-II and its subsequent targeting to pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes [19]. Beclin1 is a mammalian autophagy gene, and its increased expression suggests increased cellular autophagic activity. In addition, Beclin1 can also bind to Bcl-2 and inhibit tumorigenesis, is monoallelically deleted in human breast and ovarian cancers and is expressed at reduced levels in the latter tumours [20,21].",

The build-up of unfolded proteins is monitored by many ER protein chaperones, including GRP78 [glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa, also called BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein)]. GRP78 is located in the lumen of the ER, and in unstressed cells it binds to the luminal domains of three ER membrane-bound proteins: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-\u03b1 kinase 3 {PERK [PKR (double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase)-like ER kinase]}, IRE1 (inositol-requiring protein-1) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6). GRP78 functions as a major chaperone during protein folding and controls the activity of three major signalling pathways that originate from different ER transmembrane proteins [22,23].",

To import intact TMV particles or TMV-RNA into HeLa cells, we used two methodologies: electroporation or liposome transfection, respectively. Following the electroporation procedure [27], intact TMV particles were transformed into HeLa cells by electric shock with different voltages (0, 140, 280 and 360 V). Western blotting results showed that there was a little more CP expression in HeLa cells treated with 280 V than with the other voltages, but not high enough in CP expression (Figure 1A-a). This result suggests that some cells may have been fatally damaged by the strong electric currents. Thus we concluded that electroporation was not the proper method for TMV transfection. Recent reports have demonstrated that the liposome transfection method is more effective and less toxic to cells than other transfection methods [28]. Thus we used this method for TMV-RNA transfection. HeLa cells were incubated with a mixture of TMV-RNA and liposomes at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 for 6 h. Western blot analysis showed that CP was produced more abundantly at the ratio of 1:1 than 1:2 (Figure 1A-b), indicating that TMV-RNA can be effectively transfected into HeLa cells by using an equal proportion of liposomes. Moreover, the morphology of the cells did not change during the process of incubation. Thus we found an effective way to import TMV-RNA into HeLa cells, and this technique was applied exclusively in the following experiments.",

To determine whether autophagy was triggered after transfection, the ultrastructure of HeLa cells transfected with TMV-RNA for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h was analysed by TEM. Numerous vacuoles and some membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes (arrowheads) were observed in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells (Figure 1C, T-6 h, T-24 h). Moreover, typical mature autophagosomes with double-membrane vacuolar structures containing visible cytoplasmic contents increased over time (Figure 1C, T-48 h, T-72 h; Figure 1D). Vacuoles were only rarely found in cells not transfected with TMV-RNA (Figure 1C, Con), and only a few vacuoles were observed in cells incubated with liposomes only (Figure 1C, Lipo).

To detect the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II, cells transfected with TMV-RNA for 24, 48 and 72 h were analysed by Western blotting. We found that the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II was augmented if TMV-RNA treatment was extended to 72 h (Figure 1B). To monitor alterations in autophagic flux mediated by TMV-RNA, an immunoblot-based LC3 flux assay using flow cytometry was performed to quantify the number of autophagosomes. As shown in Figure 1(E), cells with autophagosomes detected using an FITC-conjugated anti-LC3 antibody were increased in HeLa cells following TMV-RNA transfection, whereas the expression of LC3-II was almost undetectable in the untransfected cells. Moreover, 3-MA, a common inhibitor of autophagy [29], was used to block autophagy in HeLa cells. In TMV-RNA-transfected cells treated with 3-MA (5 mM, Sigma) for 24 h, autophagy was markedly inhibited. Altogether, these observations suggest that TMV-RNA induces autophagy in HeLa cells.",

Neither Beclin1 nucleic acid nor Beclin1 protein was found in HeLa cells not transfected with TMV-RNA. To verify that the activation of Beclin1 in HeLa cells was indeed associated with TMV-RNA-induced autophagy, a human breast-cancer cell line in which Beclin1 is monoallelically deleted and thus expressed at reduced levels (MCF7 cells) [30] was transfected with TMV-RNA using the same protocol. Additionally, to interfere with the expression of the Beclin1 gene in cells we also transfected a Beclin1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) vector into HeLa cells. The Beclin1 siRNA vector was transfected into HeLa cells 24 h before the transfection of TMV-RNA. Analysis of the expression of Beclin1 and LC3 in MCF7 cells or HeLa cells by Western blotting showed that no Beclin1 was detected in MCF7 cells with or without TMV-RNA transfection, and the expression level of LC3 in MCF7 cells did not change after transfection (Figure 2C). Moreover, the expression of both LC3 and Beclin1 in HeLa cells transfected with both the Beclin1 siRNA vector and TMV-RNA was reduced compared with cells transfected with TMV-RNA only (Figures 2B and 2C). Taken together, the invasion of TMV-RNA directly results in autophagy, and Beclin1 is the key autophagy gene in TMV-RNA-transfected HeLa cells.",

Analysis of CP in the ER fraction by Western blotting showed that the expression level of CP markedly increased when the time was extended to 72 h (Figure 4A). To further confirm whether CP was located in the ER and to observe the location of TMV-RNA, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) and FISH techniques [25] in succession. TMV-positive RNA and proteins were identified in situ by confocal microscopy in cells fixed by a protocol intended to retain native cell size and shape. The TMV-positive RNA was visualized by FISH with a strand-specific probe that was labelled with a Cy3 fluorochrome (red). CP was detected using a rabbit anti-CP antibody and a corresponding secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 anti-rabbit antibody) (green), and the ER was stained with ER tracker (blue, Invitrogen).

We observed that CP (green) indeed accumulated in the ER as small, irregularly sized granules, whereas TMV-RNA (red) rarely appeared in the ER but was enriched in the nucleolus.

When we monitored the cells after TMV-RNA transfection for 24 h, TMV-positive RNA (red) was found throughout the cells as small, irregularly-sized granules (Figure 5B, H.P.T. 24 h) that then accumulated in the nucleus as high-density granules after 48 h (Figure 5C, H.P.T. 48 h).

In contrast, TMV-positive RNA could not be detected in cells transfected with TMV-RNA that were hybridized with an unrelated probe (Figure 5A-c, Con). The above results suggest that TMV-RNA uses intracellular ribosomes to synthesize viral proteins in the ER and that the positive RNA localizes to the nucleus to perform other functions.

The control mechanisms of these processes are not fully understood and are the focus of many ongoing investigations. Several reports have shown that ERS can activate autophagy, and conversely, blocking autophagy can enhance ERS-induced cell death [33]. In recent immunoelectron microscopy studies, Dunn has reported that autophagosomes originating from pre-existing ER acquire lysosomal markers in a stepwise fashion during maturation into autolysosomes. Dunn also classified vacuoles morphologically and cytochemically into two groups: (i) nascent autophagic vacuoles (or autophagosomes) and (ii) degradative autophagic vacuoles (or autolysosomes) [34,35]. Herein, we showed that the invasion of TMV-RNA not only triggered autophagy, but also induced ERS in HeLa cells. To further elucidate the connection between autophagy and ERS, we examined the morphological changes of the cells using EM.",

The nascent vacuoles appeared to be produced from the ends of ER membranes (arrowheads), and they expanded to resemble swollen fingers in some pictures. Such structures might be transported to form autophagosomes. Some images also demonstrated that the ER membrane expanded to resemble forks extending towards the anterior vacuole (Figures 6B-b, 6B-d and 6B-g), suggesting that partial ER membranes might be used to form phagophores, structures that will fuse with a nascent vacuole. Neither autophagic vacuoles nor the expansion of the ER was found in cells not transfected with TMV-RNA (Figure 6B-a). Taken together, there are a series of interesting events that are occurring; the distal end of the ER membrane expanded like swollen fingers or forks, which might indicate that the cells were stimulated by the TMV-RNA and induced into a state of ERS. This phenomenon of ER membrane expansion was not found in cells not transfected with TMV-RNA (Figure 6B-a).",

Moreover, the other distal end of the expanded ER membrane was sequestered in a vacuole (Figure 6B-d, arrowheads). The ER membrane expanded so greatly that it might have produced more vacuoles (Figure 6B-e, arrowheads), with nascent vacuoles emerging from the end points of the expanded ER membranes (Figure 6B-f, arrowheads). Moreover, fusion events might have occurred between lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles (Figure 6B-f, pane). Finally, a huge autolysosome formed in the cytoplasm, some partial ER membranes expanded to resemble forks extending towards the vacuole (Figure 6B-g, two small panes) and one vacuole had just been produced from other partial ER membranes (Figure 6B-g, arrowheads). Based on these data, it appeared that the process of autophagy, including the maturation and formation of autophagosomes, was required for the expansion of the ER membrane. Hence all of these observations confirmed that the membranes of TMV-RNA-related autophagic vacuoles might be contiguous with or originate from ER membranes. This result explains why more and more vacuoles appeared and accumulated around the expanded ER membranes when the transfection time was extended. We presume that, under ERS, the distal end of the ER membrane expands to maximize the transformation into more vacuoles, which when encapsulated by a monolayer membrane, are called phagophores (which might form from partially expanded ER membranes; see Figures 6B-c, 6B-d and B-f). When expanded phagophore cisterns wrap around a portion of the cytoplasm and/or organelles, autophagy is triggered. During the autophagosomal maturation process, the segregated cytoplasm that is engulfed by a phagophore is delivered to the endo/lysosomal lumen by fusion events between autophagosomes and endosomal and/or lysosomal vesicles. Both the cytoplasm and the surrounding membrane are then degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, and the degradation products are transported back to the cytoplasm where they can be re-used for metabolism. Together with our data, the expansion of the ER induced by ERS results in the formation of autophagosomes in TMV-RNA-transfected HeLa cells.",

            "text": "These studies provide some clues into the pathway of TMV-RNA-induced autophagy. Once the TMV-RNA enters HeLa cells, it first synthesizes proteins in the ER, as evidenced by CP in the ER. With the accumulation of TMV proteins in the ER, cells experience ERS and activate ER chaperones (such as GRP78 in the ER lumen) to increase protein folding capacity. If enough TMV proteins are produced so that the capacity of GRP78 is exceeded, ERS stimulates the ends of ER membranes to expand to maximize sequestration into vacuoles in which TMV proteins (such as CP) might be produced. These new vacuoles are wrapped rapidly by phagophores (which also likely originate from the ER and look like the forks in our electron micrographs) that further form autophagosomes. Finally, with the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, autolysosomes form to digest the vacuolar contents; we suggest that these vacuolar contents might not be digested, but instead, immune escape occurs through some unknown molecular mechanism. The latter assertion is supported by our evidence of the accumulation of TMV proteins on and around autophagosomal membranes, by the increased CP in the ER and by the enrichment of TMV-positive RNA in the nucleolus. In conclusion, TMV-RNA induces ERS-related autophagy in HeLa cells, and a potential defence mechanism involving ERS and ERS-related autophagy utilized by HeLa cells against TMV-RNA is modelled in Figure 7.",

An immunological memory against TMV may not exist in human innate immune cells. It is reported that there are two pathways that detect viral infection in cells; one is an exogenous pathway in which virally-derived ssRNA is detected by TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7) in endosomes after degradation of the viral envelope and capsid proteins by host-cell enzymes. The other pathway is an endogenous pathway in which autophagy serves a function analogous to endocytosis, transferring viral RNA from the cytoplasm to intracellular compartments containing TLR7 [36,37].

If TMV-RNA is recognized by TLR7, it would be engulfed by the host cell through the process of endocytosis and digested by lysosomal enzymes. Both TMV-RNA and TMV protein would therefore be removed through this pathway. However, here, we not only demonstrated the accumulation of CP in the ER, but we also unexpectedly observed that TMV-positive RNA moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Even more surprisingly, we discovered suspected TMV virions in HeLa cells by TEM. Although this evidence is not sufficient by itself to determine whether TMV-RNA replicates in HeLa cells, we found that not all of TMV-RNA or TMV protein was digested during the process of autophagy. Thus we presume that autophagy functions as a pro-viral pathway after the invasion of TMV into HeLa cells, which might aid in TMV-RNA replication in HeLa cells. Some recent reports have demonstrated that viruses use accumulated autophagosomes for their replication. In these reports, an even more dramatic subversion of macroautophagy is induced by several ssRNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. Picornaviruses (poliovirus and rhinoviruses), coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and SARS) and one arterivirus (equine arteritis virus) replicate on the surface of autophagosomal membranes [40\u201342]. These viruses likely block the fusion of autophagosomes that carry the viral replication complexes with lysosomes. The generation of autophagic membranes as scaffolds for the replication machinery is essential because inhibition of macroautophagy by siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg12 or Atg8 (LC3) inhibits viral replication [40\u201342]. Based on these discoveries, we attempted to determine why TMV protein accumulated on autophagosomal membranes when the transfection time was extended and whether the translation of TMV-RNA was associated with the maturation of autophagosomes. To address these questions, we first sought to demonstrate the replication of TMV-RNA in HeLa cells; we need to find the production of TMV-negative RNA in HeLa cells, evidence of TMV particles isolated from HeLa cells by EM and the occurrence of viral passage in HeLa cells. When the replication of TMV-RNA in HeLa cells is further verified, a mouse tumour model could be established by administering TMV-RNA-treated HeLa cells or untreated HeLa cells in vivo and assessing whether TMV-RNA can also induce autophagy and replication in vivo. Although autophagy is primarily a protective process for the cell, it can also play a role in cell death. Thus, if TMV-RNA-induced autophagy occurs in vivo, it would cause rapid tumour cell death, further inhibiting the growth of the tumour. If this scenario proves true, TMV-RNA may be used as a therapy for human tumours in the future.",

Recently, some EM studies have also shown that autophagosomal membranes originate from the ER or are contiguous with it. For example, Bernale et al. [33] discovered that ER proliferation was accompanied by the formation of autophagosomal-like structures that were densely and selectively packed with membrane stacks derived from the UPR (unfolded protein response)-expanded ER. Ueno et al. [43] showed that ER membrane markers were preserved in autophagic vacuolar membranes isolated from the rat liver vacuoles of animals administered leupeptin. Axe et al. [44] reported that autophagosomal formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was dynamically linked to the ER and that a ring-like particle (termed an omegasome) formed, indicating that the autophagosome formed in close association with the ER. Herein, we also described a likely process of TMV-RNA-induced autophagy (Figure 6B). A series of electron micrographs provided potent evidence for the expansion of ER membranes into mature autophagosomes. Thus we conclude that ERS stimulates ER membranes to expand and form autophagosomes.",

We observed the locations of TMV-RNA, autophagosomes and the ER in live cells with a Zeiss LSM 510 Inverted Live-Cell Confocal System. TMV-RNA was labelled with CTAB-QDs (red) [45], autophagosomes were labelled with GFP\u2013LC3 (green) and the ER was stained with ER tracker (blue). At 4 h post-transfection with TMV-RNA, we observed TMV-RNA as red dots and the ER as blue fluorescence. The formation of GFP\u2013LC3-labelled structures (GFP\u2013LC3 dots), representing autophagosomes was observed in cells, as was the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II. Notably, the red dots co-localized with some punctate GFP\u2013LC3 staining, and they also appeared in conjunction with the ER (blue) (Supplementary Figure S1B), whereas the GFP\u2013LC3 dots decreased in cells transfected with GFP\u2013LC3 alone (Supplementary Figure S1A). Hence TMV-RNA might co-localize with autophagosomes on the ER. This result indicates a direct connection among TMV-RNA, autophagosomes and the ER, a result that is also supported by the previous data showing that autophagosomes appear to originate from the ER membrane. Because the process occurred in a short period of time, we have to consider that autophagy might play a vital role in cellular innate immunity, especially against mutated viruses.",

[24] found that the autophagy process was activated as a novel signalling pathway in response to ERS. Although we have strong morphological evidence, we still require evidence at the molecular level to further uncover the direct relationships among TMV, ERS and autophagy. We found that the translation of TMV-RNA induced ERS, and this effect was verified by the accumulation of GRP78 in the ER. As an ER chaperone, GRP78 not only binds to unfolded proteins but also regulates the activation of ERS transducers, such as IRE1, PERK and ATF6. With the accumulation of TMV proteins, GRP78 would inevitably interact with the viral proteins as well as activate ERS signal transduction proteins, causing other cellular responses, such as the UPR and autophagy. Li showed that the UPR regulator and ER chaperone, GRP78/BiP, was required for stress-induced autophagy [50]. Whether GRP78 was also required in our study may be one way to verify ERS-induced autophagy. Our study also showed that the expression of Beclin1 increased in TMV-RNA-treated HeLa cells. Li et al. [50] reported that Beclin1 was required for ERS-induced autophagy, but not for UPR activation. Thus Beclin1 may provide another avenue to verify ERS-induced autophagy. GRP78 is located in the ER lumen, and some endogenous Beclin1 localizes to the ER. Whether these proteins have relevance any during autophagy remains to be explored.",

If the quantity of CP is too great, GRP78 might leave CP and stimulate the distal end of ER membranes to expand and swell to sequester CP into vacuoles. These new vacuoles would be enwrapped rapidly by phagophores, which likely originate from the ER. These new phagophores resemble forks extending towards the vacuole, and they engulf it to promote maturation into double-membrane autophagosomes.
