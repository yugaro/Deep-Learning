Global estimates reveal about 50,000 human deaths from rabies every year, and higher mortality among the livestock [1]. Diverse species of warm-blooded animals transmit the causative agent, a single stranded RNA virus of the genus Lyssavirus of the viral family Rhabdoviridae. Natural exposure to rabies virus through animal bites is very common in the endemic countries of Asia and Africa where companion animals, mainly dogs, are the main vectors of viral transmission to humans [2]. Rabies is 100% fatal but preventable by timely administration of effective pre- or post-exposure vaccination.",

However, these expensive, temperature-sensitive biologicals are often not available in many endemic areas. Successful immunization of about 70% of susceptible canine population could prevent rabies transmission among canines [3], but this faces technical and logistic challenges [4]. Canines require annual rabies vaccination from 3 months of age, and often do not develop adequate protective immunity due to poor immunogenicity of the vaccines used, or co-existent malnutrition and diseases. Huge numbers and rapid turnover of free-roaming canines and difficulties in retrieving them for booster vaccinations introduce additional layers of complexity into canine vaccination programmes in the developing countries. Clearly, potent, inexpensive vaccines and efficient mass vaccination strategies are needs of the hour in canine rabies control in the rabies-endemic countries.",

A eukaryotic expression vector encoding full-length glycoprotein gene of rabies virus represents the simplest design of an anti-rabies vaccine, capable of generating protective neutralizing antibodies upon in vivo delivery. Such constructs have been shown to mediate efficient prophylaxis in small animal models, but are observed to be poorly immunogenic in larger animals ([5], and references therein). In general, systemic lability, poor cellular uptake and low immunogenicity remain major hurdles limiting the utility of plasmids for in vivo applications [6]. Attempts to improve plasmid-based vaccination are currently focused on improved vector design, gene modifications and the use of efficient delivery vehicles and molecular adjuvants [7,8].",

Such attempts have generally employed co-administration of discrete plasmids encoding the immunogenic gene and the adjuvant, or constructs designed as fusions of the two. These molecules could be advantageous in achieving site-specific adjuvanting, and limiting adjuvant toxicity [17]. A variety of cytokine, chemokine, pro-apoptotic and other genes have been reported to be effective adjuvants for plasmid-based vaccines [18,19,20,21,22,23,24].",

The authors commented that genetic adjuvants may be unable to influence early events of immune response, due to temporal differences in expression of the immunogen and the adjuvant genes. The present study, in contrast, evaluated immune responses to plasmids co-expressing viral glycoprotein and Myd88 genes. Co-expression of both the genes was appreciable in fluorescently-stained transfected cells, and it would seem likely that MyD88 expression could have influenced activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells at the site of inoculation.",
