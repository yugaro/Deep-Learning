In addition, many bat species are gregarious, living in dense aggregations, and some roosting sites can house diverse assemblages of bat species (Kunz 1982; Kuzmin et al. 2010), which could facilitate transmission of pathogens and sustain acute\u2010immunising infections. In evolutionary terms, bats are ancient mammals, and it has been hypothesised that viruses that evolved in bats may use conserved cellular receptors enhancing their ability to transmit viruses to other mammals (Calisher et al. 2006). The diet of some species has been hypothesised to facilitate transmission of viruses; after feeding, frugivorous bats often leave partially eaten fruit behind which can be contaminated with viruses (Chua et al. 2002; Dobson 2005). Bats are the second most diverse mammalian order with over 1100 species, with many overlapping species distributions; multiple regions across the globe are home to more than 40 bat species, allowing for species to interact and potentially spread viruses between them (Fig. 1; Calisher et al. 2006; Luis et al. 2013).",

Rodents are a suitable group for comparison because they also host many important zoonotic viruses and share many of the characteristics hypothesised to make bats suitable as viral reservoirs. For example, rodents are also evolutionarily ancient; they are older than bats and more closely related to humans (dos Reis et al. 2012). Rodents are the most diverse mammalian order with approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species, many of which express torpor, and display a wide range of life history traits, including some long\u2010lived species.",

Here, we use networks to describe sharing of viruses between different species, rather than individuals. This is akin to other ecological networks, such as food webs, mutualistic, or host\u2013parasite networks (Montoya et al. 2006). However, we collapse the bipartite network (separate nodes for viruses and host species) to a unipartite projection, weighting contacts between host species by the number of viruses they share. In the same way social networks can highlight the disproportionate importance of specific individuals, such as \u2018super\u2010spreaders\u2019, in population\u2010level disease dynamics, our networks can highlight the importance of certain species in host\u2013virus communities and disease emergence.

At some roosting sites, bat densities can be as high as 3000 bats per square metre, and some roosts house diverse assemblages of species (Constantine 1967; Kunz 1982). High densities can lead to high contact rates, facilitating pathogen transmission and persistence. These dense roosting sites are often caves, therefore we had hypothesised that propensity to roost in caves would be an important predictor of viral sharing in bats. However, colony size (gregariousness) was more important than where the colony roosts.

The importance of sympatry is reflected in similarities between viral and host species richness maps (Fig. 1). Locations where host species diversity is highest generally have more viruses. However, bats in Europe and India have greater viral richness than predicted by the host species richness map (Fig. 1a,c), and this does not appear to be due to sampling bias (Fig. S7). The community context may provide additional insight. There are two host\u2013virus communities connecting Europe to East Asia where species richness is high (Fig. 3c,f), and these communities may provide a bridge. Higher viral richness than expected from host species richness in India may also reflect connections with areas of high species richness in S.E. Asia (Fig. 3c). For the viral richness maps, we assumed that the virus exists throughout the distribution of its host(s) analogous to the fundamental niche concept (Hutchinson 1957; Harris & Dunn 2010) and representing the broadest possible distribution. However, there may be barriers that restrict the realised niche of a virus. For example Rhinolophus ferrumequinum hosts SARS\u2010like coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus, and its range extends from E. Asia to W. Europe, but the populations in E. Asia and Europe do not appear to mix (Flanders et al. 2009).",

One approach which we implemented was creating networks using weighted edges based on sampling effort; this gave us confidence that among the species in our database, the connectance is higher in bats than in rodents. Although our database only has 9% of extant rodent species and 13% of extant bat species, the rodents in our database have been more studied overall and more studied for viruses than bats even when removing the most highly studied, lab rodents \u2013 Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (significant by t\u2010test on log number of citations for the species name, means = 4.90 & 4.44, P = 0.002; and the species name + virus, means = 1.99 & 1.43, P < 0.001). We would expect more of the total viral community to have been identified in the more highly studied group of species (rodents), thus the sampling bias should increase the apparent connectance in rodents compared to bats. However, this does not account for species not in our database. If the rodent species that have not been sampled share more viruses than the bat species that have not been sampled, then these results may not hold. Similarly, the species trait data was only available for roughly 37% of the bat and rodent species in our networks, which corresponds to 5 and 3% of known extant bat and rodent species respectively; therefore, the species traits associated with important hosts may also change as our knowledge increases. New viruses are being discovered frequently, suggesting that there are many more viruses yet undetected in both bats and rodents. Therefore, our conclusions and the maps of viral diversity for both orders (Fig. 1) may change significantly as our knowledge increases. We hope that this first, broad examination of viral sharing will help motivate future efforts including more directed data collection.",

We took care to distinguish the hantaviruses and arenaviruses, for which there is relatively good knowledge of host\u2013virus relationships. However, we found that this did not impact the qualitative conclusions \u2013 when using ICTV classifications the rodent network still had lower mean degree (13.8), mean weighted degree (19.01), connectance (3.51%) and transitivity (0.57) than the bat network. However, for most of the reported viruses in bats and rodents, there is little knowledge of the ecology and epidemiology in these hosts. This again highlights the importance of further study of both bats and rodents as reservoirs of viruses.",
