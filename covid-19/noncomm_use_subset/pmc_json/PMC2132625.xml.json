Sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors were then added and the cells incubated for another 1 h before processing for immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). In control cells, IBV M exhibited a tight, juxtanuclear staining pattern that colocalized with Golgi markers. The Golgi localization pattern of IBV M was unchanged by treatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1, suggesting that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for proper localization of IBV M. In contrast, PDMP-treated cells showed a marked change in the staining pattern of the IBV M protein after 1 h. The localization of IBV M in the presence of PDMP changed from Golgi to ER based on the absence of strong juxtanuclear staining and the presence of nuclear rim staining and a tubulo-reticular staining pattern that colocalized with ER markers. Treatment of infected cells with lower concentrations of PDMP had no effect on IBV M localization and very little effect on SM synthesis (data not shown). We next tested the kinetics of PDMP-induced mislocalization of IBV M. Cells were infected as before and treated for 1 h with cycloheximide. Then cells were treated with PDMP for varying lengths of time up to 1 h (Fig. 3). Redistribution was first observed at 15 min and became maximal at 60 min. This redistribution was rapidly reversible, such that 30 min after washing out PDMP, IBV M had moved back to the Golgi region. ",

As we did not have access to antibodies that crossreact with known markers in BHK-21 cells, we examined ERGIC-53 in Vero cells. IBV M localizes to the CGN in these cells and is also redistributed to the ER by PDMP (data not shown). ERGIC-53 is an IC protein that cycles between the ER, IC, and Golgi stack (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993).

PDMP inhibits the conversion of ceramide into glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin. One possible explanation for the effects observed with PDMP was an accumulation of the precursor ceramide. \u03b2CA and FB1 act upstream of PDMP (Fig. 1), and the intermediates in sphingolipid synthesis between these steps and ceramide production are thought to be short lived (Merrill and Wang, 1986; Medlock and Merril, 1988). To ask if ceramide accumulation might mediate the PDMP-induced slowing of anterograde traffic, cells were treated with \u03b2CA or FB1 before PDMP. We performed a pulse\u2013chase labeling experiment with cells pretreated with either \u03b2CA or FB1 for 1 h before being chased in the presence or absence of \u03b2CA or FB1 and PDMP (Fig. 6).

To simplify the quantification, the localization of IBV M was classified into one of three staining patterns. Class 1 was the most commonly seen pattern in untreated cells, i.e., tight juxta-nuclear staining that colocalized with Golgi markers. Class 3 was the most commonly seen pattern in PDMP-treated cells, i.e., diffuse staining with prominent nuclear envelope staining that colocalized with ER markers. Class 2 was intermediate between the class 1 and class 3. Whether this pattern represents an overlap of ER and Golgi staining patterns or an increase in IC staining is not clear. For these experiments, coded samples were quantified by counting at least 100 cells for each sample. The experiment was performed five times, with one representative experiment shown (Fig. 7). Interestingly, when cells were quantified in this way, we observed that both \u03b2CA and FB1 caused a slight shift from class 1 to class 2. The significance of this observation is not clear. PDMP dramatically shifted the distribution of IBV M from mainly class 1 in the control cells to mainly class 3. Pretreatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1 significantly reduced this shift in the staining pattern of IBV M, suggesting that accumulation of newly synthesized ceramide mediates the effects of PDMP on localization of IBV M.

Ceramide can act as a second messenger (for review see Hannun, 1994) and has been suggested to be the mediator of some of the effects of PDMP in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993). Furthermore, in several systems, cellular levels of ceramide increased upon treatment with PDMP or one of its more soluble analogues (for example see Rani et al., 1995; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997). We measured the levels of ceramide after various treatments by pulse\u2013labeling with [3H]palmitate. After labeling and treatment, cellular lipids were extracted and run on chromatography plates. The appropriate spots corresponding to ceramide were scraped and counted. Consistent with our hypothesis, Fig. 8\nA shows that PDMP treatment increased the levels of ceramide 2.5-fold over control levels. Pretreatment with \u03b2CA reduced PDMP- induced ceramide accumulation to roughly half of control levels, but this level was still threefold higher than cells treated with \u03b2CA alone. Fig. 8\nB is a representative fluorograph showing the ceramide region that was quantified in Fig. 8\nA.

If this were true, addition of a soluble, short-chain analogue of ceramide might mimic the effects of PDMP. Indeed, one such cell-permeable analogue of ceramide, N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6Cer), reproduces the effects of PDMP on anterograde traffic of VSV G in CHO cells (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993). We first asked whether C6Cer slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. A pulse\u2013chase labeling experiment with VSV-infected cells was performed, with cells chased in the absence or presence of 25 \u03bcM C6Cer. C6Cer slowed the rate of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells \u223c2.5-fold (data not shown). We went on to use C6Cer in our indirect immunofluorescence assay. As expected, C6Cer had no effect on the localization of either Man II or \u03b2-COP (Fig. 9). However, contrary to our expectation, C6Cer did not alter the localization of either IBV M or ERGIC-53. This suggests that exogenously added C6Cer and ceramide generated by treatment with PDMP do not have the same effects. Two other soluble analogues of ceramide, C2Cer and C8Cer, were also tested and found to have no effect on the localization of IBV M (data not shown). ",

The redistribution of IBV M induced by PDMP was surprising, as we expected that if we disrupted its localization, it would move with \u201cbulk flow\u201d to the plasma membrane. That IBV M was redistributed to the ER suggests that it has specific targeting information for retrieval to the ER. Coupled with earlier work in our laboratory on the role of oligomerization of IBV M chimeras in CGN targeting (Weisz et al., 1993), our findings suggest that IBV M maintains its steady-state distribution by both retention and retrieval (Fig. 10\nA). We propose two models to explain the redistribution of IBV M protein induced by PDMP. The simplest model (Fig. 10\nB, left arrow) is that the M protein normally cycles between the ER and the Golgi at a significant rate, as has been shown for ERGIC-53 (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993). The slowing of anterograde traffic would cause the protein to shift its steady-state distribution to the ER, assuming that retrograde traffic is unaffected or perhaps increased by PDMP. A second possibility is that PDMP disrupts retention of the M protein, which then cycles back to the ER by normal retrieval mechanisms (Fig. 10\nB, right arrow). These two models are not mutually exclusive, and both effects of PDMP may be necessary to redistribute IBV M to the extent observed. ",

PDMP-induced ER redistribution was also observed for ERGIC-53, a dilysine-containing IC marker known to cycle through the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1993). Double-label immunoelectron microscopy in HeLa cells showed that the distribution of ERGIC-53 and IBV M overlapped significantly, though not completely (Sodeik et al., 1993). This suggests that IBV M may in part use the same, as yet unknown, cellular machinery used by IC proteins to maintain its steady- state localization. Using deletion mutants and chimeric molecules, dissection of IBV M retention and retrieval information should be possible using PDMP as a tool. The pathway followed by IBV M during retrieval will also be important to decipher. Experiments in nontreated cells suggest that the protein may move through later Golgi compartments even though its steady-state distribution is the CGN, because its oligosaccharides are slowly processed (Machamer et al., 1990).",

            "text": "Interestingly, it has been shown that myriocin, an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis thought to inhibit the same step as \u03b2CA, reduces the rate of transport of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein but not other proteins out of the ER in yeast (Horvath et al., 1994). It would be interesting to test whether inhibition of ceramide synthesis in mammalian cells also slows the rate of transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins in mammalian cells. However, neither \u03b2CA nor FB1 had an effect on the rate of anterograde traffic of VSV G or the localization of IC, CGN, or Golgi stack proteins. When we quantified the effects of these two inhibitors on the immunofluorescence staining pattern of IBV M, we did detect a slight shift toward the intermediate staining pattern (Fig. 7). Whether this represents an altered distribution pattern or subtle effects on Golgi structure caused by these inhibitors is unclear. From these results we conclude that ongoing sphingolipid synthesis is not required for either normal rates of anterograde traffic or proper localization of Golgi proteins. However, the glucosylceramide analogue PDMP, at a concentration that inhibits both GlcCer and SM synthases, causes a redistribution of IBV M to the ER and a slowing of anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. Why does PDMP have these effects while \u03b2CA and FB1 do not? It is likely that PDMP exerts its effects by causing the accumulation of ceramide. Other groups have found that the various effects of PDMP and its active analogues were concomitant with (Uemura et al., 1990; Shayman et al.; 1991; Rani et al., 1995) or actually caused by increases in ceramide concentrations (Abe et al., 1996; Posse de Chaves et al., 1997). In BHK-21 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM PDMP for 1 h we measured an increase in newly synthesized ceramide (Fig. 8\nA), showing at least a correlation between levels of newly synthesized ceramide and the effects of PDMP on protein traffic and localization. The fact that pretreatment with either \u03b2CA or FB1, both of which block the synthesis of ceramide, can ameliorate the effects of PDMP demonstrates that ceramide is at least in part the mediator of these effects. However, the effects of PDMP are not completely abolished by pretreatment, even though \u03b2CA pretreatment reduced the level of newly synthesized ceramide by 50% compared to control. One explanation is that ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. Another possibility is that ceramide is being generated by the degradation of preexisting sphingolipids, e.g., at the cell surface or in lysosomes. This ceramide cannot be made back into sphingolipids because the enzymes SM and GlcCer synthases are inhibited in the presence of PDMP. Interestingly, the fluorograph of the ceramide bands generated after the various treatments (Fig. 8\nB) shows different relative amounts of ceramide species. We suspect that these ceramides differ in acyl chain lengths (Abe et al., 1992) and that this may be an indication of different sources of ceramide, i.e., de novo synthesis or sphingolipid degradation. We are currently investigating this possibility.",

            "text": "Based on the pretreatment results, we expected that soluble analogues of ceramide would mimic the effects of PDMP. Rosenwald and Pagano (1993) showed that like 100 \u03bcM PDMP, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer decreased the rate of transit of an itinerant protein to the medial-Golgi in CHO cells. Consistent with these results, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer also slowed anterograde traffic in BHK-21 cells. However, 25 \u03bcM C6Cer had no effect on the localization of either the M protein or ERGIC-53. Other short-chain ceramide analogues (C2- and C8-ceramide) also had no effect on IBV M localization. How does this fit with our model that ceramide mediates PDMP effects? One explanation is that the effect on protein localization is independent of the effect on anterograde traffic rates. In this case, it may be that C6Cer and endogenous ceramide have similar ability to bind and affect proteins that regulate anterograde traffic, but C6Cer is unable to bind or affect proteins that regulate protein localization. It has been shown that some short chain analogues of ceramide do not have the same effects as endogenous ceramide (e.g., Wolff et al., 1994). A second possibility is that effects of ceramide are limited to the bilayers in which its concentration increases, and the difference seen between endogenous ceramide and exogenous C6Cer is due to the different intracellular distribution of these molecules. C6Cer would be unlikely to accumulate in compartments where IBV M and ERGIC 53 reside, because it is rapidly converted to sphingolipids there (Rosenwald et al., 1992). Effects on membrane traffic might be more dramatic in compartments where C6Cer accumulates, possibly the trans-Golgi and TGN (Pagano et al., 1989). Consistent with this idea, the rate of movement of VSV G through the late Golgi (measured by sialylation) was slowed to a much greater extent by C6Cer than by PDMP (Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993).",

Recent studies have shown that ceramide (Hannun, 1994) and its metabolites (Hakomori, 1990) play a major role as second messengers. Preliminary experiments with both the ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine and exogenously added sphingosine suggest that the ceramide breakdown product sphingosine does not play a role in the localization of IBV M (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase (Dobrowsky and Hannun, 1992; Wolff et al., 1994) that can be inhibited by okadaic acid. Preliminary experiments suggest that okadaic acid does not block the PDMP-induced changes (Maceyka, M., and C. Machamer, unpublished observations). Ceramide could be activating a protein kinase (Mathias et al., 1991), but this kinase has not been fully characterized. Another possibility is that increased ceramide within the lipid bilayer directly affects the localization of IBV M. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that the first transmembrane domain of IBV M can target chimeras to the CGN (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993). It is possible that CGN bilayers have distinct lipid domains, and that these domains contain different sets of proteins, analogous to glycosphingolipid rafts. Segregation of membrane proteins involved in vesicular traffic, such as SNAREs, would lead to mobile and immobile domains. We hypothesize that under normal conditions, IBV M would be targeted to an immobile domain and escaped molecules would be cycled back through the ER. Elevated levels of ceramide could disrupt these immobile lipid domains, inducing IBV M to cycle. Alternatively, perhaps ceramide binds to IBV M transmembrane domains, preventing an interaction with immobile lipid domains.",

At 5 h after infection, cells were treated with 1% isopropanol (control) or 100 \u03bcM PDMP. 1 h later the cells were fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. Random fields from coded samples were scored for the number of IBV M\u2013expressing cells that fell into the three classes of staining pattern shown.
