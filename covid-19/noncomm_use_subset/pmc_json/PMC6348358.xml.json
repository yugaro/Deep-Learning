The development of cancer takes place over years and encompasses multiple genetic and phenotypic modifications. Cancer remains the second most common cause of mortality after cardiovascular diseases [1]. Among all cancers, breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally after lung cancer. In the USA, breast cancer is responsible for 25% of all cancers found in women, making it one of the fatal diseases [2]. Currently, conventional breast cancer treatment involves therapeutic regimens such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of some of these. The 5-year survival rate has not shown any improvement with the currently used treatment stratefies [3]. Further, due to serious side-effects, multidrug resistance, non-selectivity as well as quick removal of the drugs from the systemic circulation, new, more effective and safer anticancer drugs are needed.",

            "text": "Natural products have always played crucial roles in the discovery of anticancer drugs and many of these naturally occurring anticancer drugs are currently used clinically [4]. Chemoprevention involves the use of naturally occurring or synthetically/semi-synthetically prepared compounds to intervene in the carcinogenesis process during the initiation or advanced stages of cancer. These compounds can actually reverse, inhibit or stop the process of carcinogenesis [5, 6]. Plant-based compounds such as terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, xanthones, coumarins, anthocyanins, carotenoids, etc, have been reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity against a range of cancer cells in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models. These compounds have been shown to exert their anticancer effects via a variety of mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, modulating protein expression of various cell signalling pathways including the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway, etc [7\u201311]. Glycyrrhiza glabra is an important medicinal plant with tremendous pharmacological activities which include neuroprotection, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Though several molecules from this plant have been evaluated pharmacologically, one of the active constituents, glycyrrhizinic acid, has not been evaluated against breast cancer [12]. Keeping in view the role played by naturally occurring compounds and tremendous potential of Glycyrrhiza glabra in anticancer drug discovery, the primary objective of the current research work was to study the anticancer effects of glycyrrhizinic acid in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells along with demonstrating its effects on cell cycle phase distribution, cancer cell migration and modulation of the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",

The findings are shown in Figure 7 and indicate an interesting outcome. As compared to the untreated control cells, glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells showed concentration-dependent downregulation of m-TOR and pm-TOR proteins. It also showed downregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expression. Thus it may be concluded that glycyrrhizinic acid induced anticancer and apoptotic effects via the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.",

            "text": "Due to the lack of effective treatments, cancer is a fatal disease and is rated as the second most common cause of death. The major issues limiting the available chemotherapies are severe side effects and chemo-resistance [1]. Natural products due to fewer side effects and higher pharmacological potential are considered important targets for development of drugs. Glycyrrhiza glabra, an important medicinal plant, is considered of tremendous potential [12]. Glycyrrhizinic acid, also known as glycyrrhizin, is a triterpene saponin mostly isolated from the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra. Glycyrrhizinic acid has been reported to possess various pharmacological effects [16]. It has been shown to inhibit liver cell injury and is given to patients suffering from chronic or viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The compound has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis [16\u201318]. Glycyrrhizinic acid has also been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and antiviral effects against a range of viruses including SARS coronavirus, HIV, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [19\u201322]. However, the anticancer activity of glycyrrhizinic acid against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as well as its effects on cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, cell invasion and the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway have not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are regarded as effective strategies to stop the uncontrolled cell growth by eliminating cancerous cells. Apoptosis especially acts as a protective mechanism that abolishes harmful or damaged cells prior to the appearance of malignancy [20\u201322]. Against this backdrop the present study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects of glycyrrhizinic acid \u2013 a naturally occurring triterpene saponin compound \u2013 on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We also studied the effects of this compound on colony formation, cell cycle phase distribution, cell invasion and the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt pathway. Initially, the MTT assay and clonogenic assays were used to evaluate the effects of glycyrrhizinic acid on cell viability and colony formation tendency, which showed that this compound induced potent cytotoxic effects along with inhibiting colony formation efficacy of these cells. Our results are in agreement with previous studies. Several plant-derived molecules such as chrysophanol and caffeic acid have been reported to exert their antitumor effects via inhibition of colony formation [23]. Furthermore, using flow cytometry, effects of this drug on apoptosis induction were studied, and indicated that glycyrrhizinic acid induced both early and late apoptosis in these cells. After treatment with a 10, 50 and 100 \u00b5M dose of glycyrrhizinic acid, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 24.8%, 58.3% and 74.1% respectively. Cell cycle arrest is a common cause of growth inhibition. To determine whether the effect of extracts involves alterations in cell cycle progression, cell cycle distribution analysis flow cytometry using propidium iodide as a probe was used to study the effects of this compound on cell cycle progression. The binding of water soluble, DNA intercalating propidium iodide correlates with the amount of DNA within a given cell, and the relative content of DNA indicates the distribution of a population of cells throughout the cell cycle [24]. Glycyrrhizinic acid induced sub-G1 cell cycle arrest and led to a significant increase of sub-G1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further, it was shown that glycyrrhizinic acid could inhibit MCF-7 cancer cell invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings are promising since it is well established that breast cancer is one of the most invasive cancers and glycyrrhizinic acid could inhibit this behaviour. Finally, the effects of glycyrrhizinic acid on the expression levels of various proteins including m-TOR, pm-TOR, PI3K, p-PI3K and Akt were studied using western blot assay. The results revealed that glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells exhibited concentration-dependent downregulation of m-TOR and pm-TOR proteins. It also showed downregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expression.",
