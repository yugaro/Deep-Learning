The CDC PUI case definition includes epidemiologic and clinical criteria (Table 1). To ensure complete case findings, the real-time log of cases maintained by the physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic was supplemented by querying infectious diseases and ED staff for all PUI evaluated during the study period. During this outbreak, routine screening of all patients to identify those meeting PUI criteria were implemented at all points of entry in the healthcare system, including the ED and outpatient clinics [14, 15]. Screening questions about recent travel and symptoms of illness were asked at the time of appointment scheduling (for outpatients) and arrival at all clinics, EDs, and hospitals. Examples of triage flowcharts used by the EHC Department of Emergency Medicine can be found on the EHC Ebola preparedness website [5].\n",

Whenever possible, PUI with low epidemiologic risk for EVD and without \u201cwet\u201d symptoms (such as active diarrhea, vomiting, or bleeding) were triaged to the tropical medicine clinic. Persons under investigation for EVD were triaged to the ED if they required evaluation outside of clinic hours, reported \u201cwet\u201d symptoms, or had any medical indication for ED-level care. Triage to the ETU was made on a case-by-case basis and reserved for patients for whom there were high levels of concern for EVD, based on epidemiologic risk factors and clinical symptoms. Persons under investigation referred to EHC by public health authorities (after identification through active monitoring and screening programs) were also triaged in a similar manner. For the outpatients evaluated at the tropical medicine clinic, a detailed protocol for receiving the patient in an isolated ambulance entrance, security-escorted transport to the clinic, and evaluation in the clinic was developed and described elsewhere [14]. When possible, physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic, ED, or ETU were notified in advance of a patient meeting PUI criteria. For patients arriving unexpectedly, screening protocols were integrated into the check-in procedures in the EDs and clinics to identify and isolate PUI [14, 16]. Patients screening positive in areas not designated to evaluate PUI were urgently evaluated by an on-call infectious disease staff to confirm their status and arrange transport to the tropical medicine clinic or ED if needed.",

Considerations included the presumptive or confirmed diagnosis, severity of illness, and feasibility of close monitoring and social distancing of patients in the community. Infection prevention precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) were used as per CDC recommendations for PUI [17]; however, whether or not to maintain enhanced levels of isolation for hospitalized PUI was determined on a case-by-case basis after discussions with Infection Prevention and public health authorities. In all cases in which EVD testing was performed, the PUI remained in isolation at the place of evaluation until the results were available and a disposition plan was made. Routine practice drills and continuous performance reviews were standard in all areas of evaluation.",

For febrile patients, blood cultures, malaria rapid diagnostic testing (BinaxNOW; Alere, Orlando, FL), and blood smear examination for malaria parasites were routinely performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory symptoms and tested with an influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (for influenza A 2009H1N1, influenza A, and influenza B; GeneXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and/or a multiplex PCR assay for 14 different viral pathogens, including influenza A, influenza AH1, influenza AH3, influenza 2009H1N1, influenza B, adenovirus (B, E, C), rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza (types 1, 2, 3), and human metapneumovirus (eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel; GenMark, Carlsbad, CA). Other testing, such as throat swabs for Group A streptococcal infection (rapid testing and culture) and multiplex PCR testing for gastrointestinal infections (FilmArray Gastrointestinel Panel; Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT), were done when clinically indicated. This panel included Campylobacter (Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter upsaliensis), Clostridium difficile, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae), diarrheagenic Escherichia coli/ Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, adenovirus F40/41, astrovirus, norovirus GI/GII, rotavirus A, and sapovirus (I, II, IV, and V). Laboratory testing was performed in the routine clinical laboratory of EHC when suspicion of EVD was low (after consideration of presenting symptoms and epidemiologic risk level). However, for PUI with increased concern for EVD (including all patients where Ebola testing was indicated), testing was performed at a specialized isolation laboratory located in the ETU [18] until EVD was determined to be extremely unlikely based on a negative Ebola virus test and other epidemiologic and clinical features of the case. In these situations, some tests were limited because routine microbiologic cultures could not be performed in the ETU laboratory [18].",

None of the patients reported direct contact with a patient with EVD within the prior 21 days, and none met CDC criteria for high epidemiologic risk of EVD. Six patients (24%) were hospitalized after evaluation for management of a non-EVD diagnosis (3 with malaria, 2 with ILIs, and 1 with diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]). One patient initially evaluated in the tropical medicine clinic and discharged with home quarantine was re-evaluated at our ETU for Ebola testing 2 days later when fevers continued and an alternative diagnosis was not confirmed.

Approximately half of the patients in this series were evaluated in an outpatient setting without requiring admission to the ED, hospital, or ETU.

However, 16% of patients had potentially life-threatening non-EVD diagnoses that required urgent treatment, including 3 patients diagnosed with P falciparum malaria and 1 with DKA. With careful risk stratification and triage, only 4 PUI were evaluated in our ETU, although the ETU laboratory was used in the testing of an additional 4 PUI evaluated in the ED.

However, because coinfections with Ebola virus and other infections are possible [19], it should be emphasized that confirmation of a non-Ebola diagnosis does not effectively rule out EVD, and patients must be monitored closely to ensure clinical improvement before they can be determined to be free of EVD. Determination of the appropriate level of infection control precautions and personal protective precautions (PPE) for hospitalized patients were individualized based on epidemiologic risk, clinical picture, preliminary test results, and after discussion with the hospital infection prevention team and public health authorities.",

The screening and triage protocols that were implemented in our EDs and clinics [14\u201316] were critical for the prompt identification and management of these patients. Using epidemiologic screening and decision trees developed by the CDC and Emory [7, 15], the majority of patients were determined to be of low risk for EVD, and they did not require specific Ebola virus testing. Routine Ebola virus testing for all PUI was not practical; furthermore, the imperfect sensitivity of Ebola virus testing in the first 3 days of illness [20] would have limited its utility in ruling out EVD with certainty in the majority of the patients, because most presented within 1 day after onset of symptoms. Given these limitations, the decision of whether or not to perform Ebola virus testing was individually made for each PUI, considering the epidemiologic risk, symptomatology, and duration of symptoms. Therefore, our clinical approach was to carefully evaluate each PUI, rule out other potentially life-threatening conditions, and use Ebola testing judiciously. Because patients who recovered were considered ruled out for EVD, diagnosis and prompt treatment of other suspected or confirmed causes of infection was particularly important during the monitoring period. Although none of our patients were empirically treated for malaria, this might be considered in situations in which the patient is clinically unstable and there is limited ability to perform malaria rapid diagnostic testing.",

Given the relatively short incubation period of influenza and other respiratory virus infections, it is likely that many of the respiratory infections were acquired after arrival in the United States. The 2014\u20132015 North American influenza season peaked locally in the Atlanta area in December [22], and influenza A contributed to the peak of PUI evaluated during that month (Figure 1). Although several patients developed influenza A infection despite immunization with the seasonal influenza vaccine (consistent with reports of limited vaccine efficacy during the 2014\u20132015 influenza season [23]), the number of influenza cases observed strongly supports influenza vaccination for all travelers who do not have contraindications whenever the vaccine is available. In addition to risks of seasonal transmission in the United States, influenza is among the most common vaccine-preventable travel-related infections among international travelers [24] and can circulate year-round in tropical areas [21]. Prophylactic oseltamivir for returning travelers from Ebola-affected areas during influenza season may even be considered to reduce the chance of acute influenza illness during the 21-day monitoring period, particularly when the traveler is exposed to close contacts diagnosed with influenza.",

The majority of patients in this case series had traveled for Ebola response work, and none of the PUI who had traveled for Ebola response had malaria, which might be reflective of the high rates of malaria prophylaxis use reported by these patients. In contrast, the 3 patients diagnosed with malaria had traveled for other reasons, and none had taken malaria prophylaxis.

We found that most PUI in our series had low suspicion for EVD and could be managed without admission to our ETU or testing for Ebola virus. Other Ebola assessment centers are advised to work closely with their local health departments and institutional laboratory personnel to determine their approach when evaluating PUI for EVD [25], with particular attention to Ebola virus testing and other tests needed for the timely diagnosis of other potentially life-threatening infections. Because PUI may present unexpectedly at numerous clinical sites, we found that screening at all potential sites of patient intake was critical, including the screening of outpatients over the phone when appointments are scheduled. Precautions to minimize visibility of PUI (eg, using an alternative, low traffic entry point to the tropical medicine clinic) were important to protect patient privacy, especially because the level of PPE used may attract excessive attention from patients and staff. Evaluation of PUI in the clinic and ED was time and resource consuming in numerous ways. In addition to enhanced PPE, our protocols required dedicated staffing for each PUI at numbers beyond what is routine in the clinic or ED, and each evaluation typically required several hours total, from the time of triage to final disposition. Because PUI are restricted from using public means of transportation, the transport of PUI also presented challenges when patients lacked personal means of transport. In this situation, close collaboration with the local health department was needed to arrange for ambulance transport using appropriate precautions. Regular practice drills and tabletop exercises were important to train staff and identify gaps in our procedures. Although our procedures presumably incurred significant direct and indirect costs for our healthcare system, we believe that the high consequences of EVD warranted a specialized plan for PUI.",
