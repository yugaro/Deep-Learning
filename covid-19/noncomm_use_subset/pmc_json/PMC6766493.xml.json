            "text": "Heart base tumors (HBT) lie near the coronary artery (CA) circulation, with potential to recruit coronary flow resulting in steal phenomenon. Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) is used to treat HBTs, but in people can cause detrimental effects to CAs including endothelial dysfunction and accelerated arteriosclerosis. The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate CA proximity to HBTs by computed tomography angiography (CTA) and quantify radiation dose to CAs in dogs treated with SRT. Forty\u2010five dogs that underwent CTA for HBT between 2009\u20102018 had their epicardial CAs categorized as within, adjacent, or distant from the HBT. Twenty\u2010three dogs underwent SRT and their CAs were contoured to quantify radiation dose received by the left vs right CA system. Direct recruitment of CA flow to HBT was seen in 18/45 cases, deriving from circumflex CA (14 dogs), left CA (3), and right CA (1). At least one CA was within the HBT in 24/45 cases, adjacent in 36/45 cases, and all CAs were distant from the HBT in 5/45 dogs. Higher radiation dose was received by the left CA system in dogs whose left CA branches were within or touching the HBT (P < 0.02) while a similar trend was seen for the right CA (P = 0.09). In dogs, HBTs commonly lie in proximity to the epicardial CAs and recruit flow from the CAs. SRT for HBT exposes the CAs to radiation. Taken together, coronary steal and radiation damage may cause risk for myocardial ischemia in dogs with HBT.",

In ponies, the influence of endocrine status on L\u2010lactate concentrations was also investigated. Blood samples were obtained from 101 ponies and 51 horses. Breed, weight, height, measures of BC and L\u2010lactate concentrations were recorded. In ponies, triglyceride and ACTH concentrations were measured and an oral glucose test performed. Correlations between L\u2010lactate and BC parameters were established. The association between L\u2010lactate concentrations, equid type (pony or horse), BC, age, and glucose concentrations was investigated in a multivariable model. Weak (P = 0.001) negative correlations were detected between L\u2010lactate concentration and the average BC score (r = \u22120.29), heart girth: height ratio (r = \u22120.27) and age (r = \u22120.27).

The condition is invariably fatal. Based on the severity of the clinical phenotype, occurrence only in the TB breed, and similarity to inherited infantile hypocalcemia in humans, a genetic investigation was performed. Clinicopathologic data from two affected TB foals excluded other causes of hypocalcemia. Pedigree analysis revealed a likely autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, with both foals related on the sire's side within 2 generations and on the dam's side within 6 generations. DNA samples from both foals and their dams were whole\u2010genome sequenced to ~12x coverage on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequence reads were trimmed, mapped to EquCab2.0, and variants identified. Initially, candidate genes implicated in human inherited hypocalcemia (CASR, GNA11, or TRPM6) were evaluated for putative genetic mutations but none were identified. To further investigate other potential variants, a whole\u2010genome association study was performed. A segregating putative functional variant, resulting in a homozygous nonsense mutation in a gene encoding for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor,was highly associated with idiopathic hypocalcemia. The altered base pair is 100% conserved across 100 vertebrae species. Additionally, this genetic variant was not identified in 175 horses from 21 non\u2010TB breeds. Comparative data revealed that, while expressed ubiquitously at the protein level, the transcript is predominantly expressed in parathyroid tissue. Therefore, a nonsense mutation in a guanine nucleotide exchange factor is a likely causative variant for idiopathic hypocalcemia in Thoroughbred foals.",

            "text": "Aortopulmonary fistulation (APF) is extremely rare in the general horse population but relatively common in Friesian horses. Typically, a transverse tear in the aorta occurs near the remnant of the ligamentum arteriosum, with formation of a fistula towards the pulmonary artery. The fistulation often is a relatively long and irregular shaped tract. A wide range of clinical signs may occur. Tachycardia and right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension are usually present. Often a holosystolic and early diastolic murmur are found dorsal to the aortic valve area. Obtaining good quality cardiac ultrasound images may be challenging in some Friesians due to their body conformation. The purpose of this study was to describe how to take diagnostic ultrasound images of APF, applicable in equine practice. Data from 9 Friesian geldings and 3 mares (mean body weight 591 \u00b1 54 kg) were included. Age ranged from 4 to 12 years (median 5.8). All horses underwent a full echocardiographic exam including 2D, M\u2010mode and color flow Doppler. In addition, specific views were acquired to visualize the APF. All horses showed ultrasound changes compatible with severe pulmonary hypertension and a decrease in aortic size. From the right parasternal left ventricular outflow tract view and right ventricular (RV) inflow\u2010outflow view (Figure 1), APF could be visualized in the triangle between right atrium (RA), aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) in 8 horses, but lesions were sometimes subtle. Color flow examination from these views did show abnormal flow suggestive for APF in 6 horses. One horse showed an aortic dissection with a circular pseudo\u2010aneurism (cuff) of the entire visible aorta. Left\u2010sided long\u2010axis views of the PA from the third intercostal space were superior to visualize the APF. With cranial (45\u00b0) and slight dorsal (10\u00b0) angulation (no rotation) (Figure 2), the PA and Ao were visualized. Subsequently, the course of the PA was followed until its bifurcation by gradually rotating the probe clockwise and simultaneously angling it dorsally and caudally. From these views, the APF could be clearly identified between PA and Ao in all horses. It was located dorsal to the PA, caudal and ventral to the Ao. Color flow Doppler indicated turbulent flow in the APF and PA in all horses. The actual tear in both vessels could be identified in 11 horses. In all horses APF was confirmed on post\u2010mortem. In conclusion, Friesians with APF show ultrasound findings that indicate pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. However, for accurate diagnosis specific ultrasound views from aorta and pulmonary artery are needed. Longitudinal images from the PA, taken from the left third intercostal space clearly showed the APF in all horses.",

During gestation, ZIKV induces placental inflammation and insufficiency, limiting effective nutrient exchange and directly damages fetal tissues.

The main objective of this study was to develop a relevant model to study the viral dynamics at the maternal\u2010fetal interface including fetal congenital abnormalities using sheep. Our research hypothesis was that pregnant sheep inoculated with ZIKV would be permissive to viral replication resulting in transmission to the developing fetus.

Clinical illness score was assessed daily. Blood was collected daily until 14 days post inoculation (dpi) and PCR performed to identify viremia in the dams. Transabdominal ultrasound was performed weekly, assessing fetal viability. Clinical illness was not observed in any sheep following inoculation. Following 7 dpi and 14 dpi, fetal wastage occurred in all sheep in the IA and IV group, respectively. Molecular techniques were performed, confirming ZIKV.

Increased RA of Mycoplasma sp was associated with more rapid development of lung lesions, while increased RA of Sharpea sp was associated with slower development of lung lesions following bacterial challenge. Interestingly, the RA of Pasteurella sp was not affected by antibiotic treatment in NP swabs or postmortem tissue samples. The increased speed of lung lesion development in calves with higher RA of Mycoplasma sp may be related to synergy between the challenge strain and the resident strain of Mycoplasma sp within the NP. Sharpea sp are lactic acid bacteria with potential antagonistic activity against Gram negative infections; this bacterial population may have partially inhibited the growth of the challenge strain.",

The objective of this study was to compare the results of disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for susceptibility testing of 48 M. haemolytica isolates collected before and after mass medication with tulathromycin. Each isolate was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing with disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and whole genome sequencing. For a given antimicrobial, the percentage of isolates classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant were compared between the three methods using an exact test of marginal homogeneity. Overall categorical agreement between testing methods ranged from 42\u2010100%, with the lowest agreement being for comparisons of broth microdilution and WGS for penicillin in cattle prior to mass medication. Perfect agreement was found for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and gamithromycin for all testing methods in isolates prior to mass medication and for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline, gamithromycin, and tilmicosin for all testing methods after mass medication. Very major errors (falsely susceptible) were detected in 3/18 possible comparisons prior to mass medication and 1/18 comparisons after mass medication. Major errors (falsely resistant) and minor errors (all other errors) were detected in 0/18 and 6/18 comparisons prior to mass medication and 1/18 and 6/18 comparisons after mass medication, respectively. The results of this study show that discrepancies in the results of different susceptibility testing methods exist and suggest a need for harmonization of susceptibility testing methods.",

Alternatively, frequent sample collection with repeated milking may increase drug elimination. Previous work with intravenously administered flunixin has demonstrated that continuously sampling the udder using ultrafiltration is an effective means to address these concerns. The objective of this study was to continuously sample both a healthy and mastitic quarter from cows with naturally occurring mastitis to compare the drug concentrations of intramammary infusions of ceftiofur. An ultrafiltration probe was placed with ultrasound guidance into the gland cisterns of normal and mastitic quarters of ten mature mid\u2010lactation cows (9 Holstein and 1 Jersey cows) with naturally occurring subclinical mastitis. The ultrafiltration probe was secured to the caudal or lateral aspect of the udder depending on the quarter being sampled. Ceftiofur hydrochloride (125 mg, Spectramast LC) was infused into both sampled quarters at time 0 and 24 hours. Ultrafiltrate samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hours post initial drug administration. Each cow was routinely milked by machine every 12 hours, and milk weights were collected. An aliquot of milk was collected from the treated quarters immediately prior to milking, during milking, and at the conclusion of milking. Equal volumes of these aliquots were mixed for assessment of drug concentrations in whole milk. Ceftiofur and its desfuroylceftiofur\u2010related metabolites were analyzed by ultrahigh\u2010performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS). Milk samples were aseptically collected from both treated quarters immediately prior to treatment and on days 5, 7, and 14 after treatment for aerobic culture. Samples were obtained from 9/10 healthy quarters and 8/10 infected quarters. In the infected quarters, 3 of 8 were positive for coagulase\u2010negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS), 2 of 8 were positive for S. aureus, and 1 of 8 were positive for Streptococcus uberis, Aerococcus spp., or Escherichia coli. Six of 8 mastitic quarters were culture negative at the conclusion of the study with one CNS and one S. aureus infection not being eliminated. All healthy quarters remained negative throughout the study. At the conclusion of the ongoing drug analysis, we will determine the impact of mastitis on active ceftiofur concentrations in the udder, and the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and treatment outcome. We conclude that collection of ultrafiltration samples from the mammary gland of cows provides a viable means to continuously assess drug concentrations in the milk while continuing to milk the cow normally, and more accurately associate pharmacokinetic parameters with treatment outcomes.",

            "text": "Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a progressive adult\u2010onset neurodegenerative disease that has similarities to human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Temporal post\u2010mortem DM dog central nervous system (CNS) tissue studies have demonstrated neuronal degeneration and astrogliosis in the mid to lower thoracic spinal cord, among other locations. We recently identified a c.118G > A transition in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1) that predicts an E40K missense mutation and underlies most cases of canine DM. Similarly, rodent (mouse and rat) G93A SOD1 mutants are known ALS models with related CNS pathological manifestations. A hallmark of CNS tissues within ALS patients, DM dogs and SOD1 mutant rodents is the loss (30\u201070% over time vs healthy controls; disease and species dependent) of the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT2) protein found on CNS astrocyte (glial) cells. Regional CNS excitotoxic injury, promoted by elevated neurotransmitter L\u2010glutamate concentrations, is thought to be a result of altered EAAT2 activity and/or astrocyte availability. Recently, a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging fluorine\u201018 radiolabeled tracer, known as 18F\u2010FAA, which targets the CNS EAAT2 protein has been synthesized. The purpose of the study was to initially evaluate whether EAAT2 changes in male and female DM dogs relative to healthy controls can be detected by utilizing 18F\u2010FAA spinal PET imaging, coupled to magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) anatomical tissue data.",

Multiple tracer doses were afforded per production run, with high molar activity (133\u2010925 TBq/mmol) and purity (>95%). The imaging derived input function used the heart left ventricle. The VT estimates were derived with a two compartment (one tissue) kinetic model. A significant statistical difference in 18F\u2010FAA tracer VT was found for T5\u2010T12 thoracic spine, where the DM cohort had a lower VT value than the HC cohort (ANOVA P = 0.0212). A significant VT change in cervical spine (HC vs recently diagnosed DM) was not found. We conclude that the HC vs recently diagnosed DM cohort findings demonstrate that 18F\u2010FAA PET imaging is sensitive for the detection of thoracic spinal cord EAAT2 protein target changes. These initial outcomes are consistent with previous DM EAAT2 spinal pathology determined by post\u2010mortem ex vivo measures as reported in the literature (eg, Ogawa et al., 2014, Vet.

Here, we collected swabs from the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of cats diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), as well as from the conjunctiva, and nasal and ororphangeal tissue of healthy cats and cats experiencing clinical signs associated with URI's. FCoV was detected in the conjunctival, nasal, and oropharygeal regions in cats displaying differing degrees of respiratory signs and detected within FIP cats upon necropsy. The nasal turbinates of an FIP cat were examined histologically and had multifocal regions of pyogranulomatous inflammation. Using immunohistochemistry, FCoV antigen was detected within macrophages in the areas of inflammation.
