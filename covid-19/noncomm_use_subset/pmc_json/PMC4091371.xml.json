For these patients, we used the hospital's microbiologic database to identify those who had one or more respiratory samples sent to the hospital's diagnostic laboratory for testing with a multiple real-time PCR assay specific for detecting a panel of viruses as part of their routine workup. Besides the availability of real-time PCR virus detection data, the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) acute febrile illness (\u2265 38.0\u2103), (2) a diagnosis of respiratory infection, including upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia, and (3) hospitalization. Duplicate samples positive for virus and collected from the same patient within a week were excluded from analysis. Co-detections were counted as separate cases. Nosocomial infections were excluded by identifying and omitting cases in which respiratory symptoms developed \u2265 2 days after admission. The isolation rate for each respiratory virus was defined as the ratio of the number of patients showing the presence of the given virus divided by the total number of specimens submitted for multiple real-time PCR assay during the study period. Each isolation rate was analyzed monthly. Patients were divided into two groups: children < 15 years old and adults > 19 years old. Clinical data for adults were obtained from medical records. Data included demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms, diagnosis at admission, length of hospital stay, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality.",

An initial pre-PCR step of 94\u2103 for 15 minutes was performed, and this was followed by a total of 35 PCR cycles according to manufacturer's instructions. VTM alone was used as a negative control.

In comparison, hRV had the highest isolation rate, followed by AdV, RSV A/B, and hMPV, in children. Thus, different respiratory viruses should be considered depending on the patient's age when a clinically relevant respiratory infection is suspected. Our findings are consistent with other studies focused on adult patients [4, 5, 6]. However, the frequencies of detection for each virus were different. These differences likely originated from distinct study designs and patient populations, and seasonal variations during the study periods. In the present study, hRV and IFA/IFB were major pathogens associated with hospitalization of both children and adults. Although influenza virus is well recognized as an important cause of hospitalization, the roles of other respiratory viruses are not well defined. It had been generally acknowledged, except for severely immunocompromised hosts, that hRV was not commonly associated with severe illness resulting in hospitalization. However, with the implementation of molecular diagnostic techniques, the human hRV is now being recognized as one of the common causes of hospital admission [4, 5, 6]. Although serious sequelae are infrequent, hRV should be considered in the virologic diagnosis of severe respiratory infections [7, 8].",

Two or more pathogens were detected simultaneously in 2.0% of the adults; RSV A and RSV B were frequently co-detected. The clinical significance of co-infection remains uncertain. Co-detection could indicate a pathogenesis that requires interaction of the co-detected respiratory viruses. Alternatively, co-detection could merely reflect residual viral shedding from a previous infection or incidental virus that is commonly found in the upper airways with unclear clinical significance [9]. A previous study of infants showed that co-infections of RSV and other viruses caused a higher incidence of fever and longer duration of hospitalization compared to solitary RSV infection [10]. However, in some studies, no clinical differences were reported [11, 12]. In this study, the number of cases was too small to compare the clinical outcomes. Further studies are required to understand the potential respiratory virus interactions and the clinical differences between single and concurrent multiple infections.",

Recent pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 showed overall rates of bacterial co-detection of 20%-24% [14]. Our study demonstrated a similar prevalence of bacterial co-detection of 26.5%. S. pneumonia and S. aureus are commonly recognized etiological agents, and data in this study are consistent with this [15]. Despite no apparent difference in clinical symptoms, lower respiratory tract involvement, length of hospital stay, and mortality were more common in cases with bacterial co-detection. This information may help with the decision to use an antibiotic.",

Second, real-time PCR may be overly sensitive and pathogen detection may not accurately reflect true respiratory infection. Third, not all specimens were tested for the presence of viruses, which likely would have increased the number of pathogens identified. Fourth, over the study period, the number of real-time PCR analyses were gradually increased, so the number of submitted samples analyzed in the early part of the study was small. Thus, more recent analysis results are likely to be over represented. Finally, the etiology of respiratory viral infection appears to differ according to the patient's age, especially for children. This made it difficult to conduct meaningful subgroup analyses stratified by age due to the reduced number of child patients per subgroup.",
