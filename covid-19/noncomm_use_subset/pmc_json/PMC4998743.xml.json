Two mechanisms underlie the person-to-person transmission of viral infections of the respiratory system: exposure to large-droplet infectious nuclei that remain suspended in air for short periods, and exposure to small-particle infectious nuclei that can remain suspended in air for long periods.26 Generally, large-particle aerosols are believed to account for viral transmission.",

RSV was only detected at the short distance, and influenza A virus was only detected at the long distance. Surprisingly, there was no enterovirus RNA in the air samples or object surface swabs. The absence of enterovirus from the air samples indicates that the likelihood of air and/or droplet transmission of this virus was extremely low. Its absence from the objects in the rooms housing the children with enteroviral infections is most likely explained by our periodic disinfection of these rooms with a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Our detection of RSV RNA in air samples collected only at the short distance (60\u2013180 cm) is at odds with a previous study showing RSV in air samples collected 30 to 700 cm from the head of the patients\u2019 beds.34 Additionally, influenza A virus RNA was detected in 15% of the air samples obtained at the long distance but in no air samples obtained at the short distance.

Consequently, the short-distance samplings did not represent the potential \u201cdroplet\u201d transmission mode, which was initially presumed, and the long-distance samplings did not represent the potential \u201cairborne\u201d transmission mode. Second, because the surfaces of the designated objects were sampled only once, rather before and after disinfection, we could not evaluate the effects of disinfection. Third, the number of patients enrolled and the number of pathogens examined were relatively small, and further studies should be conducted to allow definite conclusions.",
