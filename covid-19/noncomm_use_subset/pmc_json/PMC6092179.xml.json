This was arranged by the transplant nurses as part of the clinical routine.

Their study included BAL samples, expectorated sputum and tracheal suction, as well as NPH wash samples, primarily analyzed with cultures from 2000 to 2008, and with PCR from 2009 onward. It is indicated that a majority of the samples were BAL samples, and the main detection method was culture-based, which might explain the lower proportion of VRTI-positive subjects (25%) compared with our study (52%) and other prospective studies (51-61%).7,20-22 Fisher et al12 published a retrospective study of 250 patients with at least 1-year follow-up, in which tests for VRTI were performed upon clinical suspicion but no surveillance testing was carried out. The samples were tested using different methods including PCR, fluorescence microscopy and cultures. They found a time-dependent relationship with CLAD development at 3, 6, and 12 months after VRTI, with an HR declining with time after the event.

However, the survey bronchoscopies that detected lower VRTI with a simultaneous finding of the same virus in upper airways were performed on asymptomatic patients in 70% of the cases. It is likely that some of the patients with asymptomatic upper VRTI, detected at surveillance sampling without bronchoscopy, also had a lower VRTI thus the true impact of lower VRTI may have been underestimated. A hypothetic mechanism for the graft damage is a disturbed repair mechanism due to decreased regulatory T (Treg) cell activity caused by the immunosuppressive treatment. A function of Treg cells is to suppress proliferation of fibroblasts triggered by cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) attacking infected respiratory epithelial cells. An absence of Treg cells in immunosuppressed patients might lead to poor control of inflammatory responses and dysregulated epithelial repair mechanisms.28 Thus, immune response induced by VRTI early after lung transplant might not stop with clearance of the virus and cause epithelial injury and fibroproliferation leading to reduced lung function and CLAD.29",

The study did not evaluate other known risk factors, such as gastroesophageal reflux or environmental pollution exposure after LTx. Furthermore, with respect to the high number of asymptomatic VRTIs, it would have been preferable to keep sampling intervals constant, as increased time between sampling at end of the first year might introduce a bias toward the effect of early infections. More frequent surveillance bronchoscopies to analyze the frequency of asymptomatic lower VRTI after LTx would also have been preferable.
