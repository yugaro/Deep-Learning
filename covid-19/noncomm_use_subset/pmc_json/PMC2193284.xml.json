The pool of autoreactive T cells available for activation is limited to a large extent by mechanisms of tolerance induction that eliminate self-reactive T cells 1. Animal models of autoimmune disease, however, demonstrate that some self-reactive T cells remain in the periphery. These T cells are described as \u201cignorant\u201d because they do not cause autoimmune disease when encountering self-antigen in vivo unless the self-antigen is presented in an immunostimulatory context 2\n3. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), illustrates this phenomenon. EAE is induced by immunization with central nervous system (CNS) antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) in CFA 4. Recognition of MBP in this context activates naive T cells circulating in the periphery, which then enter the CNS and initiate destruction of myelin 5. In the absence of experimental intervention, the MBP-specific T cells are not activated and do not induce EAE.",

MBP1-11\u2013specific T cells in the periphery of TCR transgenic mice are primarily naive and proliferate readily to MBP in vitro 11\n14. EAE can be induced in these mice by administration of pertussis toxin or can occur spontaneously in an environment with increased microbial exposure 14. In the studies reported here, we analyzed the ability of the MBP1-11\u2013specific T cells to traffic to the CNS in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. Surprisingly, comparable numbers of T cells were isolated from the CNS of both MBP-specific TCR transgenic mice and wild-type mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, however, most of the MBP-specific T cells found in the CNS of young mice exhibited a naive phenotype rather than an activated or memory phenotype. Similar observations were made in TCR transgenic models specific for nonself antigens. TCR transgenic models differ significantly from wild-type mice in that TCR transgenic mice have few activated/memory peripheral T cells. These results indicate that, in the absence of activated T cells in the periphery, naive T cells can traffic to the CNS. Despite the trafficking of naive MBP-specific T cells through the CNS, the majority of MBP TCR transgenic mice do not develop autoimmunity. We show that the lack of spontaneous EAE is due in part to suppression of the responses of naive MBP-specific T cells within the target organ. Furthermore, CNS cells from MBP TCR transgenic mice are able to suppress the response of nontolerant peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These data demonstrate that CNS autoimmune disease is regulated in part by the induction of tolerance to CNS antigens in situ.",

Activation of MBP-specific T cells within the CNS is only possible if some naive T cells gain access to this tissue. To investigate this possibility, we isolated lymphocytes from the brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy, 4\u20137-wk-old, well perfused, MBP TCR1 transgenic mice on the Rag+/+ background. Lymphocytes from individual animals were analyzed to avoid mixing cells from any mice that had preclinical spontaneous EAE with cells from healthy mice. Surprisingly, the number of T cells per gram of CNS tissue isolated from young, healthy MBP TCR1 transgenic mice was comparable to the number isolated from nontransgenic control mice (Fig. 1). This result was unexpected because entry into the CNS is believed to be limited to activated T cells 7\n9\n10, and TCR transgenic mice typically have few activated T cells in the periphery 14\n24.",

To test these predictions, CNS T cells were isolated from two other Rag\u2212/\u2212 TCR transgenic models that were not specific for CNS antigens.

Analyzing T cell populations in the spleen and CNS of MBP TCR1 transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice as a function of age tested this prediction.

Second, the absolute number of both total MBP-specific (V\u03b12+) T cells and CD45RBlow V\u03b12+ T cells increases with age within the CNS in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice, suggesting that the increase in memory T cells does not simply reflect an increase in T cells with endogenously rearranged TCR chains (data not shown, P = 0.00004). These data are in contrast to results from MHC class II\u2013restricted TCR transgenic mice specific for a nonself antigen, pigeon cytochrome C 24. In this model, there was an increase in peripheral memory T cells as the animals aged; however, this increase was completely in the transgene-negative T cells rather than the transgene-positive T cells.

Our data support the notion that T cells found in the CNS of wild-type mice are predominantly activated/memory T cells.

We show that the same number of T cells are found in the CNS of nontransgenic, TCR transgenic, and even Rag\u2212/\u2212 TCR transgenic mice that have very few activated T cells in the periphery. Thus, a similar number of T cells traffic through the CNS of healthy animals regardless of the number of activated T cells present in the periphery. The CNS of nontransgenic mice is enriched in activated/memory T cells, suggesting that activated T cells have a competitive advantage over naive T cells in crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, as the number of activated T cells in the periphery decreases, more naive T cells are able to enter the CNS.

In addition, naive CD4+ T cells specific for non-CNS antigens proliferate equally well when they are isolated from either the CNS or LNs, and it is only T cells from MBP TCR transgenic mice that are nonresponsive. Our data suggest instead that the interaction of naive MBP-specific T cells with antigen in the CNS results in an irreversible state of nonresponsiveness that is maintained even in the absence of soluble factors found in CNS microenvironments during inflammation.

Interestingly, our studies show that at the age when the incidence of spontaneous EAE in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice declines, the number of MBP-specific T cells in the CNS of these mice doubles and their phenotype converts to that of an activated/memory T cell. This increase in activated/memory T cells is due in part to expression of the MBP-specific TCR because the number of memory T cells is greater in the CNS of older TCR transgenic mice than in the CNS of age-matched nontransgenic mice, and much of this increase in MBP TCR transgenic mice can be accounted for by an increase in MBP-specific (V\u03b12+) memory cells. Thus, although T cells in older MBP TCR transgenic mice appear to have encountered antigen more frequently than T cells in older nontransgenic mice, this encounter is not correlated with initiation of disease. Spontaneous EAE may be prevented in older MBP TCR transgenic mice by the development of nontransgenic CD4+ regulatory T cells that have been shown to be critical in prevention of spontaneous EAE 12\n47\n48. These regulatory T cells must not function by decreasing exposure of MBP-specific T cells to antigen since memory MBP-specific T cells accumulate in older MBP TCR transgenic mice, but rather the regulatory T cells must change the outcome of this interaction.",

            "text": "In summary, our experiments suggest a model in which naive MBP-specific T cells that escape thymic or peripheral tolerance traffic at a low frequency through the CNS in normal individuals. These T cells are prevented from initiating CNS autoimmune disease by in situ tolerance when they encounter antigen within the CNS. The spontaneous autoimmune disease that occurs in some mice may be caused by a failure of tolerance at several levels. Peripheral events could activate MBP-specific T cells either by immunization, as is the common mechanism for the induction of EAE, or via molecular mimicry mediated by an infectious agent 49\n50\n51\n52\n53. Once activated, the MBP-specific T cells are no longer susceptible to tolerance in situ and can initiate autoimmune disease. Alternatively, autoimmunity could develop because tolerance occurring within the CNS is circumvented. Potential mechanisms for overcoming tolerance in the CNS include an infection that may increase costimulation and MHC expression in situ, genetic defects in the tolerance mechanisms, or peripheral infections that may influence antigen presentation within the CNS through the release of soluble factors. These experiments reveal a new form of immunoregulation of CNS-specific T cells that must be considered in the study of the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity.",
