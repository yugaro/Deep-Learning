After pathogen RNA and DNA were extracted, the\nsample, reagents, and each primer and probe were mixed in individual reaction tubes. Samples\nwere applied at 2 \u00b5l per tube. Cycling conditions, reagents and nucleic\nacid extraction procedures are described below. To verify the absence of nucleic acid loss\nduring the extraction step, the extraction liquids used in the QIAGEN and Roche kits were\nanalyzed as samples using \u03b2-actin primer-probe sets. Furthermore, PCR products were used as\n\u03b2-actin positive controls, which were created from Mardin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells\nusing conventional PCR primers (data not shown). Nuclease-free water was applied as a\nnegative control sample, again using \u03b2-actin primer-probe sets. To prepare each sample for\nassay, 10% fecal suspensions were made in PBS (\u2212). Then, 200 \u00b5l of a\nsuspension was used directly for the extraction of bacteria and protozoa nucleic acids with\na QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For virus detection, 200\n\u00b5l of a suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm, and viral\nDNA and RNA were extracted from the supernatant of the 200 \u00b5l of suspension\nwith a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Both\nnucleic acid extraction procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nA LightCycler Nano (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used for all qPCR reactions performed in\nthis study. A one step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real time) (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan)\nwas used for amplification of extracts from RNA viruses, and Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real\ntime) (TaKaRa Bio) was used for amplification of extracts from DNA viruses, bacteria and\nprotozoa. All reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l, which\ncontained the sample nucleic acid, primers, probes (the final concentration of all primers\nand probes was 0.2 \u00b5M) and all other components included in the kits,\naccording to the manufacturers\u2019 protocols. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 45\u00b0C\nfor 5 min and 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, 55\u00b0C for 20 sec and\n72\u00b0C for 20 sec. Fluorescence data were analyzed automatically using LightCycler Nano\nSoftware 1.1 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
