They were the ones who from time to time contributed life sciences-related articles to various press media. I was also requested to write a manuscript for the medical field, and the work I had written was titled An unidentified epidemic lands on Jeju Island. It was a \u2018fictious\u2019 story, set around one hundred years after the 1970s, by which time all infectious diseases had disappeared from the earth, and consequently the general public, and even medical doctors, were ignorant of what a virus is.",

The Minister is calling to notify Dr. Namgung that a strange disease is rapidly spreading on Jeju Island, and asks for immediate help. While listening to the symptoms of the disease and its pattern of transmission, professor Namgung feels a chill down his spine. He cries, \u201cAh, Mr. Minister! I am certain this is the smallpox virus, which disappeared from the earth about a hundred years ago. It is fortunate, however, that this happened only on Jeju Island. If this had happened on the mainland, it would have been really disastrous. First of all, you need to close every port that goes from the island to the mainland. Use all nationwide communication channels to tell people who have been to Jeju Island in the past three or four days or who have travelled from the island to the mainland to report themselves to community health centers for monitoring under quarantine. As you know, this is no trivial matter.\u201d Thereafter, Professor Namgung hurries toward his laboratory, muttering \u201cI must make a vaccine. A vaccine!\u201d",

            "text": "The damage that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) had inflicted on us in the two months since mid-May is severe. It has caused not only enormous economic loss, but also discomfort and anxiety felt by everyone in the country. But, most of all, it took the precious lives of 36 people. Nobody suspected that a virus too small to be seen with a regular microscope could cause this much fear in the 21st century, with cutting-edge technology available. This may even be referred to as the virus\u2019 revolt. This incident will likely cause the Korean government to strengthen the public health measures that prevent and control infectious diseases, and cause hospitals to put more effort into treating individuals who are in quarantine. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that these measures will eliminate the risk posed by infectious viral diseases. This is because, no matter how small it may be, a virus is still a \u201cliving organism\u201d which has an innate disposition for self-growth and development, and even if science hurries to develop vaccines and drugs, viruses are able to mutate at any time, to appear as a more fearful disease.",

In order to do so, effective vaccines need to be developed, and public health systems must be continually kept ready. However, with the currently high number of foreign travelers and infections that are undetectable before symptoms appear, it is not easy for the government or medical institutions to maintain such prepared infectious disease preventive systems.",

This is because there is no way to completely stop the spread of infectious diseases unless patients and those who may be infected avoid contact with others out of \u201cconsideration\u201d as a form of mature civic awareness, even though they may be inconvenienced by such actions. In fact, in countries such as the United States, Australia, and Japan, people who are returning from traveling to areas with prevalent infectious diseases are being placed under protective care if necessary, based on voluntary reporting.",

That is, \u201chumanistic introspection,\u201d which takes others into consideration, is the most effective means of preventing the spread of frightening infectious diseases like MERS. I believe this may be the most important lesson we should learn from the recent MERS epidemic in Korea.",
