Despite the known role of camels in zoonosis, many aspects of their health have not been studied before the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [1\u20134]. In fact, the possibility of spreading known and unknown zoonotic pathogens from camels to humans or other animals represents major public health and economic concerns [4\u20136]. These concerns are exaggerated further because of the inevitable close contact between camels and humans during ranching, milking, feeding, and riding, raising the need for enhanced surveillance in these animals as a one-health approach.",

            "text": "Although data on influenza viruses circulation in camels are very scarce, some existing evidence suggests the viruses\u2019 ability to infect and cause disease in these animals. Several outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in bactrian camels have occurred between 1978 and 1988 in Mongolia and were suspected to be due to influenza viruses [7]. Serum samples obtained from sick camels during these outbreaks had positive hemagglutination inhibition titers against influenza A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1) human vaccine strain [7]. Genetic and antigenic analyses of these isolates confirmed their relatedness to influenza A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1) which is a reassortant vaccine strain obtained by reassortment between two H1N1 strains (A/ PR/8/34 and A/khabarovsk/77), possibly through transmission from vaccinated humans to camels [7]. Interestingly, experimental infection of bactrian camels with these isolates resulted in productive infections and antibody responses, indicating that camels are a potentially unexplored permissive host for influenza A viruses [7]. Further active and enhanced surveillance of bactrian camels in Mongolia also resulted in the isolation of influenza A H3N8 viruses that are phylogenetically related to equine influenza A viruses, suggesting possible interspecies transmission [8]. Although the existence of influenza viruses in dromedary camels has not been investigated properly, previous studies provided limited serological evidence of circulation of all influenza types (A, B, C, and D) among dromedaries in several African countries [9\u201311].",

Out of the 665 tested samples, 11 samples (1.7 %) were positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR (Table 1). Viral RNA was detected only in imported camels from Sudan (4 samples) and Djibouti (7 samples) but not local animals (Table 1). Viral RNA was detected in both male (8 samples) and female (3 samples) camels as well as from juvenile camels between 1 to 2 years (6 samples) and those older than 4 years (5 samples) (Table 2). Viruses could not be isolated from any of the positive samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells even after 3 consecutive passages most probably due to the low viral load as shown by the high Ct values, which varied from 34.95 to 39.81 (Table 2). These results were confirmed for 5 samples by conventional RT-PCR using the same primers used in the real-time RT-PCR targeting a conserved ~100 bp fragment in the M gene of all influenza A viruses. Query BLASTn of the obtained partial sequences of the fragments from these 5 specimens further confirmed these results with >97% sequence identity with at least 1 or 2 mismatches to multiple influenza A viruses subtypes (Supplementary Table S1). This analysis did not result in any definitive determination of the circulating subtypes as expected, because the used primers target a highly conserved region in all influenza A viruses (Supplementary Table S1).

Out of the top 100 matches, 98 were H1N1 strains and 2 were H1N2 strains (Supplementary Table S2). Blasting of the 116 bases contig from segment 7 in the SPC00394 sample showed >97% identity match to residues 911 to 1027 in the M gene of influenza A viruses with a minimum of 3 mismatches with 97 H1N1, 1 H1N2, and 2 H3N2 strains out of the top 100 matching sequences. The de novo assembled reads from segment 8 of SPC00394 sample resulted in 2 contigs (92 and 111 nucleotides) that matched regions corresponding to 1\u201392 and 790\u2013900 in the NS1 gene of influenza A viruses, respectively. Although the first contig (92 nucleotides) matched 95 H1N1, 4 H3N2, and 1 H3N6 strains with >97% identity, the second contig (111 nucleotides) showed >99% identity match to 52 H1N1, 39 H1N2, and 3 H3N2 strains as well as 6 unknown or mixed influenza A isolates (Supplementary Table S2).",

Our data suggest that dromedary camels could represent a potential unknown permissive host and zoonotic source for influenza A viruses. Although the partial sequencing data obtained in this study point towards strains closely related to human and swine influenza A H1N1 isolates obtained between 2009 and 2018, it is clear that use of short fragments from highly conserved regions of internal genes are not definitive. Unfortunately, we were not successful in isolating any virus from the collected samples for better characterization or able to obtain long genome sequences to accurately determine the subtype of these viruses. Furthermore, the identical partial influenza RNA sequences from different camels arriving from the same origin on the same day as well as the detection of viral RNA from animals arriving from 2 different countries at multiple time points over 2 years reduces the possibility of environmental contamination or simple respiratory exposure to infected humans or animals. However, such evidence is not sufficient, and more studies are needed to confirm whether the detected viruses in camels are a result of a natural self-sustained infection or cross-species spillover from humans or pigs. Nonetheless, previous productive experimental infection of camels with influenza A H1N1 virus and their seroconversion, in addition to the detection of neutralizing antibody in farm and free ranging camels, clearly provide convincing evidence of the permissiveness of camels to influenza A viruses [7, 9, 10].",

The possible risks involved in interspecies transmission of influenza viruses and the odds of reassortment and coinfections in camels are also a big concern. The transmission of these viruses from camels to humans or pigs or vice versa cannot be confirmed and requires further studies to enhance our understanding of influenza ecology and epidemiology in camels and their role in influenza emergence. Future studies should focus on virus isolation, full genome sequencing, and using hemagglutinin inhibition assays in order to determine accurately the possible circulating influenza A subtypes in dromedary camels. It is of note that the detected influenza A viruses were from asymptomatic animals, and the pathogenesis and transmission of this virus in camels are not known apart from previous experimental infection in bactrian camels [7].",
