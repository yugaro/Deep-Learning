ETEC expressing K99 fimbriae is a bacterium that causes diarrhea in calves, lambs, piglets (2), and humans (3) resulting in mortality, morbidity, reduction of live weight, and huge economic losses (4). The K99 protein located at the surface of ETEC is a polymeric protein structure and has a diameter of 5 nm (2). K99 fragment encodes eight gene products named FanA to FanH, all of which are required for biosynthesis of K99 (5). The nucleotide sequence of the FanC gene comprises 159 amino acids which are proceeded by the signal sequence of 22 residues (6).",

In another study (21) IgY was applied for the protection of neonatal piglets from diarrhea caused by E. coli (ETEC).

We immunized the hens before the start of the laying period in order to avoid reduction in egg laying capacity by immunization because the adjuvant use in the immunization can directly decrease this capacity (23). Anti-FanC IgY antibody was produced by immunizing hens with the recombinant FanC protein, which can be used as a tool for the immune diagnosis. The results of this study are in agreement with the results of other studies that indicated immunized hens are an excellent alternative for production of polyclonal antibodies (24, 25). Also, the present results are the first molecular study on cloning and expression of FanC (K99) antigen of Iranian ETEC and they agree with results of the other studies that revealed E. coli expression system can be appropriate for expression at the high level of FanC antigen of ETEC (13, 26). The antigen FanC amount showed that it simulated the immunological response. It was reported the ideal does for simulating immune system ranges from 10 \u03bcg to 1 mg (27). In this study, FanC antigen concentration was within this ideal range. The antibody activity started to increase two weeks after intramuscular injection (P-value<0.05). Some studies indicated that anti-E. coli IgY activity increased two weeks post immunization (P-value<0.05) but decreased 3~4 weeks later (21, 25 and 28); this phenomenon appeared in the fourth week in the present study, but it wasn\u2019t significant and started to reach a constant level.
