After recalling that he visited the outpatient clinic of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul with his father on May 27, during which the 14th confirmed patient with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), who was considered a super spreader, was staying at the hospital, he suspected having MERS infection [1] and voluntarily reported to health authorities. He thus became the 141st patient with confirmed diagnosis of MERS during the outbreak in South Korea after May 20, 2015 (Figure 1).",

This means that he traveled to Jeju Island during the incubation period. Second, the patient visited an outpatient family medicine clinic 2 and 5 days after the contact date, which can be considered as the minimum incubation period of MERS. In other words, the 141st confirmed MERS patient traveled to Jeju Island while he was contagious condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed more weight on the latter interpretation and urgently alerted the Jeju provincial government for proactive MERS prevention on the midnight of June 18.",
