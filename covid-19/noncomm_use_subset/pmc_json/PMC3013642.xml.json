The emergence of many of these new viruses can be attributed to recombining viruses as well as to host species jump (1\u20133). Therefore, understanding how viruses interact with their hosts and more specifically how the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms are acquired and maintained throughout evolution, remains a major challenge (4\u20137). In order to assess this question, it is of prime importance to be able to detect and quantify the occurrence of lateral gene transfer events, and the impact of these events on viral\u2013host co-evolution. Indeed, the mechanisms behind fast viral adaptation are far from being elucidated. Thus, we developed a global approach aimed at providing accurate evolutionary and phylogenetic information to tackle these questions.",

Indeed, current databases present families of homologies either restricted to viruses only [Protein Clusters (8), GeneTree (9)] or to viral taxonomic groups [Viral Orthologous Cluster (10)], some also not presenting viral information [HomoloGene (11)]. The few databases that do present viral and non-viral sequences, such as Pfam (12) or the Conserved Domain Database (13) do not provide complete phylogenetic trees. This translates into the fact that it is not currently possible to have a global view on viral\u2013host lateral gene transfers due to the difficulty of obtaining global information on cross-taxa transfers at the viral level.",

The protein sequences are clustered\u2014without a priori and according to similarity criteria\u2014into families containing either only viral sequences or both viral and cellular sequences. PhEVER integrates extensive data from up-to-date completely sequenced genomes spanning a wide taxonomic range (2426 non-redundant viral genomes, 1007 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes, 43 eukaryotic genomes ranging from plants to vertebrates). To our knowledge, this is the most complete database of families of homologous viral sequences. Indeed, it not only spans all known viral groups but it also has the unique feature of presenting homologies with eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. The database offers a clustering of proteins into homologous families containing at least one viral sequence, as well as pre-computed alignments and phylogenies for each of these families. Alignments and phylogenies are built according to state-of-the-art phylogeny procedures and we provide tools to edit them and recompute them on the fly (14). We also provide the possibility for users to assign their sequence of interest to a family and to re-build the phylogeny accordingly through the HoSeqI tool (15). PhEVER thus constitutes a comprehensive working tool to detect sequence homologies and possible gene transfer events. Public access and documentation is available through the database webpage and through all dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems (16).",

In order to avoid redundancy due to the availability of numerous genomes of similar bacterial and viral strains in public databases, we collected all completely sequenced viral and bacterial genomes from RefSeq Viral (17) and Genome Reviews (18), two non-redundant and curated databases of completely sequenced genomes. To this high-quality curated data composed of Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, we added nine eukaryotic genomes from Ensembl (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Bos taurus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus) (19) to allow for a large representation of species from the different domains of life. The PhEVER database was structured under the ACNUC system (20) allowing it to be queried using a web interface and a large number of tools specifically developed for this database management system (14).\n\n",

For viral genomes presenting polypeptides which further maturate in vivo into mature peptides, the mature peptides were added to the set of translated proteins according to the annotations specified in the given genome (Figure 1). Table 1 lists the global content of the databases as well as their original sources. Annotations were extracted from UniProtKB via the cross-references found in the CDS (21). Subsequently, sequences in the nucleic and protein PhEVER database were clustered into families and were assigned a family accession number. Alignments and phylogenies were built for each of these families according to state-of-the-art procedures (Figure 1). The classification of all organisms present in the database was retrieved from the taxonomy database at National Centre for Biotechnology Information (11) and is available on the PhEVER web interface.",

            "text": "The clustering of proteins into homologous families was constructed using an automated procedure similar to the one described in (14) and implemented within a parallel framework in a software package called SiLiX. Briefly, sequences were assigned to protein families by simple transitive link using the following criteria. A similarity search of all translated proteins and mature peptides against all was performed using BLASTP2 similarity search with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, a 10\u22124 e-value threshold and the \u2018m S\u2019 filter option (22,23). For each pair of sequences, HSPs which were not compatible with a global alignment were removed. Two sequences were included in the same family if the sum of the remaining HSPs covered >80% of the proteins length (and at least 100 amino acids) and if their identity was \u226535%. These two criteria were previously shown to provide a good trade-off between the ability of clustering sequences from divergent organisms and the quality of resulting alignments for subsequent phylogenetic analyses (14). Finally, only families containing at least one viral sequence were integrated in the database. For each of the families, a small description built from the gene annotations ordered by frequency is available on the web interface. Figure 2 presents the distribution of viral species, proteins and families according to each viral group (A) as well as a Venn diagram representing the families content (B). Figure 2A presents PhEVER\u2019s broad taxonomical distribution covering all Baltimore groups (24). This distribution is naturally biased towards dsDNA, ssDNA and positive-sense ssRNA viruses reflecting the bias in genomic sequencing efforts. Indeed these groups contain long-studied viral families\u2014either for their medical interest or for their economical impacts\u2014such as Caudovirales, Poxviridae, Herpesvirales, Flaviviridae, Picornavirales or Parvoviridae. Figure 2 (B) shows a large number of orphan families indicating that a significant proportion of viral proteins (32%) do not contain any homologs with proteins from known genomes. These proteins, among which some might possibly be caused by annotation errors, are unfit for comparative functional analysis and should be the focus of future experimental studies to validate them and to provide with crucial information on viral mechanisms. Figure 2B also shows the small number of families sharing sequences from both viruses and eukaryotes compared to the relatively high number of families sharing sequences from both viruses and bacteria. This observation may be due to different underlying biological mechanisms but might also be an indicator of a still low coverage of the Eukarya domain.\n",

            "text": "One of the applications of PhEVER is the detection of horizontal gene transfer events by comparing a gene family tree with the expected species tree. The discrepancies between the gene family history and the species phylogeny can then be an indication of possible events including a gene duplication, a gene loss or a horizontal gene transfer. The quality of the gene phylogenies is therefore essential and in this perspective, we implemented a procedure based on a rigorous methodology. First, the clustering into families was built with criteria leading to conservative families. Second, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred for all families based on conserved aligned blocks. In our databases, for all families containing at least three sequences, pre-computed alignments and phylogenies are therefore already available. This allows for a simple and accurate overview of any family without the need of heavy computations and can be a useful tool to search for lateral gene transfers in viral genes. For each family containing at least three sequences, alignments were estimated using MUSCLE with default parameters (25). All alignments were treated with Gblocks (26) to select conserved blocks. Phylogenetic trees were inferred by maximum likelihood using PhyML (27) with a JTT evolutionary model (28). Branch support was inferred using the Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa-like non-parametric procedure implemented in PhyML (27,29). To accommodate for weak phylogenetic signal, a thorough exploration of the tree space was made through topological rearrangements using the Nearest Neighbor Interchange topology search method. Finally, for visualization purposes, the trees were then rooted using midpoint rooting. This procedure allowed us to build accurate phylogenies sustained by branches of high support values. Indeed, Figure 3 shows that \u223c80% of all branch supports have a value higher than 75 and one-third are above 95. Global statistics are biased by the presence of low branch supports. These are mostly due to few small families of less than 10 leaves, indicating that most families present robust phylogenies (Figure 3B). Finally, Figure 3C indicates that the low branch support values are attributable to very similar sequences with small branch lengths and might be linked to unresolved topologies. By contrast, all branch lengths longer than 0.15 subst/site display a high branch support which reveals the accuracy of our phylogenetic inference procedure.\n",

Indeed, there is strong evidence that proteins evolve in a modular way, where modules are defined as parts of proteins sharing a common evolutionary history. These modules act as small interchangeable blocks of sequences that may be combined into proteins and form novel functions (33\u201335). We are interested in providing a global tool allowing to analyse the weight of modular evolution in viral adaptation. We will therefore implement the detection of modules in PhEVER proteins to provide information concerning the exchanges of genetic information at the sub-protein level.",
