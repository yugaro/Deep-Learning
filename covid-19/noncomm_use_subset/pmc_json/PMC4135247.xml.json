There are about 187 kinds of Kimchi according to the ingredients and processing methods [2]. Kimchi is prepared by various ingredients, such as Chinese cabbage, garlic, onion, and red pepper in the presence of salt [3]. Kimchi is currently recognized worldwide as a nutritious and healthy food. Nutritionally, Kimchi is a low-calorie food (18 kcal/100 g) and an important source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber [4]. It is also a good source of phytochemicals (e.g., \u03b2-sitosterol, glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, indoles, allyl compounds) and probiotic strains (e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides) [5,6]. In regard to these nutrition properties, many functional properties of Kimchi have been reported including anti-oxidative activity [7,8], anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor activities [9], anti-atherogenic activity [10], and weight-controlling activity [11].",

Pentosaceus [22]. According to the Lee et al. [23], suppressor T cells and NK cells are increased with L. casei and Bifidobacterium longumi treatment. However, in present study, T-helper cells and suppressor T cells were not affected by the consumption of Kimchi. T cells play central roles in the immune system, in which their major function assisting B cells in the production of antibodies. Serum Ig levels are routinely measured in clinical practice to examine immune balance. Typical ranges are suggested (Ig A; 1.4-0.4 mg/mL, Ig G; 8-16 mg/mL, and Ig M; 0.5-2.0 ng/mL). Low levels of Ig were observed in humoral immunodeficiency, while high levels of Ig were observed in chronic inflammatory diseases. Until now, many studies showed that Kimchi inhibited Ig E levels in the NC/nga mice atopic animal model [24,25]. Also, lactobacillus plantarum isolated from Kimchi increased the production of Ig A in normal or S180-bearing BALB/C tumor-induced mouse [26,14]. On the other hand, 4 weeks of Kimchi supplementation does not changes of Ig A, G, M.",

These study results are useful information in further research of the patients with dysregulated immune responses.

Further studies examining a various subjects with unbalanced immune system, larger samples for longer periods are necessary to determine the immune-modulation of fermented Kimchi. In addition, the decreased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in placebo group may be due to the use of radish.
