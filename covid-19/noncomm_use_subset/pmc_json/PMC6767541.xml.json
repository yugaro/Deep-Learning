Colonisation by pathogenic micro\u2010organisms or an imbalance of the physiological microbiome in the oral cavity can play an essential role in the development and perpetuation of disease 2, 3. Indeed, viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa can give rise to many common oral and oropharyngeal conditions, as diverse as dental caries, periodontal disease, gingivitis, as well as upper respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, common cold and influenza 2. In the hospital setting, colonisation of pathogens in the oropharyngeal region can result in more serious sequelae in intubated patients, where their spread into the lower respiratory tract can result in ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia (VAP) 4.

            "text": "The active moiety, non PVP\u2010bound (\u2018free\u2019) iodine is released into solution from the PVP\u2010I complex. PVP itself has no microbicidal activity but rather delivers the free iodine to target cell membranes. It is this free iodine that mediates the basic mechanism of action (oxidation of amino acids and nucleic acids in biological structures), which is difficult, if not impossible, to counteract. This basic mechanism of action leads to strong microbicidal activity expressed by multiple modes of action that include the disruption of microbial metabolic pathways, as well as destabilisation of the structural components of cell membranes, causing irreversible damage to the pathogen. Consumed free iodine is then replaced by PVP\u2010bound iodine. The concentration of free iodine is the determining factor of the microbicidal action of PVP\u2010I 43, 44, 45. PVP\u2010I exposure leads to destruction of cytosolic and nuclear structures in bacteria and damage to the cell wall in fungi 26, 46. In a study investigating the virucidal activity of different disinfectants, electron micrographs revealed how exposure to iodine led to degeneration of the nucleoproteins of viral particles, which was the main mechanism of action 47. However, disruption of surface proteins essential for the spread of enveloped viruses has also been noted 48. In addition to a direct killing action on bacteria, PVP\u2010I also inhibits the release of pathogenic factors such as exotoxins, endotoxins and tissue\u2010destroying enzymes 49. Furthermore, iodine is a scavenger of free radical oxygen species, contributing to anti\u2010inflammatory properties 50.",

From our extensive review of the literature, there have been no clinical reports of microbial resistance development in response to PVP\u2010I treatment. This is likely due to its action on multiple pathogenic targets 52. In contrast, bacterial resistance to chlorhexidine has been documented 53. Resistance may result in alteration in bacterial susceptibility, in part, by altering the outer membranes of Gram\u2010negative bacteria and preventing antiseptic adsorption 20. Genes conferring resistance to chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds have been identified in up to 42% of S. aureus isolates in Europe and Japan 54, 55; and while there are reports of cross\u2010resistance between antiseptics, PVP\u2010I has remained unaffected 46, 52.",

Symptoms range from the common cold, cough, pharyngitis and fever to occasionally more serious complications, and are associated with high societal costs due to loss in productivity, absenteeism from school and medical resources 57. Most URTIs are caused by viruses, such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza, coxsackievirus, herpes simplex virus, coronavirus and respiratory simplex virus 58. However, current practices do not often consider the aetiological basis of the URTI, leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescription for URTI that are of viral origin 59. This is particularly evident in the treatment of pharyngitis or sore throat, where only 5\u201330% of cases are because of bacterial infections 60. Inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics further reinforce the importance of identifying alternative anti\u2010infective agents 61 to complement physical and barrier interventions e.g. handwashing and wearing of masks to prevent and interrupt the spread of respiratory pathogens.",

            "text": "The first step in the development of URTIs is the adherence and colonisation of the respiratory pathogen to the oropharyngeal mucosa. Assuming oral entry of such pathogens, gargling offers a practical measure for their eradication 62. Gargling has been strongly advocated for both prevention and treatment of URTIs in Japan, a practice supported by findings from studies that looked at the role of gargling in both healthy individuals and those with frequent or persistent respiratory infections 62, 63, 64. In these studies, gargling with either water or PVP\u2010I (four times daily), respectively, were found to reduce the incidence of URTIs. Furthermore, in patients experiencing chronic respiratory infections, PVP\u2010I was found to reduce the episodes of infections with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus (including MRSA) and H. influenzae by half 62. These findings were further corroborated by a non\u2010randomised study in which gargling with diluted PVP\u2010I reduced the incidence of influenza\u2010like illnesses or the common cold and subsequent absenteeism from school and the work place 65. While the mechanism of gargling in the prevention of respiratory infections requires further investigation, an early study suggests that gargling may lead to the removal of oral/pharyngeal house dust mite protease which has been shown to increase infectivity of the influenza virus 64, 66. Gargling, intensified by the presence of PVP\u2010I, may therefore play an important role in the prevention or reduction in the incidence of infection through droplet transmission.",

Previous studies reported PVP\u2010I mouthwash used four times daily for a short period (2 weeks) or once\u2010daily for a prolonged period (24 weeks) did not affect thyroid function 113, 114.

PVP\u2010I is therefore not to be used in those with hyperthyroidism and other diseases of the thyroid. In addition, the use of PVP\u2010I gargle should only be used during pregnancy and lactation if strictly indicated, and should be kept to the absolute minimum 115. PVP\u2010I was found to be favourably tolerated by children receiving PVP\u2010I for dental conditions 102, and in general was shown to be 20 times better tolerated than other common antiseptics 116.
