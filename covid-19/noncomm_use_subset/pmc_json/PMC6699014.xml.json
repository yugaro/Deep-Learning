Although rare, urethral strictures of presumed congenital origin have also\nbeen described in young cats.1 Diagnosis, management and confirmation of the aetiology of non-trauma-induced\nurethral strictures can be challenging owing to the sparseness of the current\nliterature describing affected cases and a lack of histopathology due to tissue size\nand difficulty in sampling.2\u20137 Several surgical options have\nbeen described for the treatment of urethral strictures. These are invasive\nprocedures with significant complications and variable outcomes.3,8\u201311 This report describes the\nsuccessful management of a suspected congenital proximal urethral stricture in a\nfemale cat using minimally invasive fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation. To our\nknowledge, this treatment modality has not been previously reported in cats.",

Abdominal ultrasonography\nshowed a focal thickening of the mid dorsal bladder wall. Mild right renal pelvic\ndilation and diverticuli were noted without ureteral dilation. Based on the clinical\nhistory, these findings were suspected to be due to a partial urethral obstruction\ncausing chronic bladder distension. Urethral catheterisation using a 3.5 Fr urinary\ncatheter (KatKath; Vigon Vet) was attempted but not possible. Therefore, cystoscopy\nwas performed under general anaesthesia. This revealed a markedly dilated urethra\nwith an abrupt narrowing near the bladder neck. The cystoscope was unable to\ntraverse this narrowing, precluding visual assessment of the bladder lumen. A\nretrograde urethrogram was performed, which confirmed the presence of caudal\nurethral dilation with a sharp reduction in the proximal urethral diameter near the\nbladder neck (Figure 1). The\nurethral wall appeared smooth and regular. Based on the urethroscopic and\nurethrography findings, a diagnosis of urethral stricture was made.",
