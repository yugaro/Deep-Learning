Upon viral entry and release of genetic material, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is generated from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and complexed with different viral proteins, histones, transcription factors and coactivators to form a nuclear minichromosome, which serves as a central template for all HBV transcription (4,5). Transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) from cccDNA is rate-limiting in genome amplification and replication. cccDNA can be amplified through an unknown mechanism (6). The stability of the cccDNA pool is a major determinant in viral clearance. cccDNA is refractory to antivirals such as nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. cccDNA is also accounted for viral relapse after cessation of anti-HBV therapy (5). cccDNA is therefore an important target for better control and elimination of HBV infection (7,8). In line with this, understanding the mechanism by which HBV transcription from cccDNA is regulated might reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

There are three isoforms of human CRTCs, namely CRTC1, CRTC2 and CRTC3. They interact with CREB and cooperate with p300/CBP to potentiate CREB-dependent transcription (15). Because various signals converge on CRTCs to exert their effects on the transcription of CREB-regulated genes, they are the targets of pharmaceutical agents such as metformin, a widely prescribed drug for type II diabetes (16).

To verify CRTC1 expression in natural infection of HBV, we examined a small number of HBV-positive or HBV-negative human liver tissues.

Indeed, all three CRTCs were recruited to preS2-CRE in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 2D, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2). Since CRTCs are thought to work in concert with CREB, we further examined the recruitment of endogenous CREB to preS2-CRE. We found that the HBV-induced recruitment of CREB to preS2-CRE was more pronounced when CRTC1/2/3 was overexpressed (Figure 2E, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2), indicating that CRTCs and CREB might activate transcription from the preS2 promoter cooperatively. In line with this, all three CRTCs were also recruited to cccDNA (Figure 2F, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2). Collectively, our results supported the model in which CRTCs facilitate HBV transcription by enhancing the recruitment of CREB to the preS2 promoter.",

As a first step, we generated additional reporter constructs in which the CRE elements in the preS2 promoter were disrupted. Similar constructs were previously described (10). Indeed, progressive removal of CRE elements effectively blunted CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter (Figure 5A, groups 5 and 6 compared to 4). Next, we asked whether functional CREB is critical in supporting CRTC1 activity by overexpressing A-CREB, a dominant inactive form of CREB (34). CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter was erased by A-CREB (Figure 5B, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). Reciprocally, CREB activation of the preS2 promoter was progressively suppressed when we increased M1-CRTC1 expression in HepG2 cells (Figure 5C, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). In line with this, the recruitment of CRTC1 to preS2-CRE was abrogated when A-CREB was overexpressed in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 5D, group 4 compared to 3). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments confirmed the formation of CREB\u2013CRTC1 complex in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A and B).

To explore whether HBx might affect the stability of CRTC1 through a similar mechanism, we compared the interaction of HBx with CRTC1 and its active non-phosphorylatable form, CRTC1-S167A. When CRTC1 and CRTC1-S167A were co-expressed with HBx in HepG2 cells, similar amounts of CRTC1 protein were found in the HBx immunoprecipitate (Supplementary Figure S3, lane 3 compared to 2). In addition, both forms of CRTC1 enhanced the recruitment of CREB to the HBx-containing complex, but to similar extent (Supplementary Figure S3, lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1). Thus, HBx has no binding preference to CRTC1-S167A. On the other hand, when we overexpressed CREB, the association of HBx and CRTC1 was not affected (Supplementary Figure S4, lane 4 compared to 3). Consistent with results in Supplementary Figure S3, both CRTC1 and CREB were found in the HBx precipitate (Supplementary Figure S4). These data were consistent with the formation of HBx\u2013CRTC1\u2013CREB triple complex.",

The K0 mutant of ubiquitin prevents polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, but allows mono- and multi-ubiquitination, which might be linked to lysosome-dependent degradation (36,37). If mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 is mediated solely through polyubiquitination and proteosome, their levels should be unchanged or increased in the presence of MG132 or ubiquitin-K0. Interestingly, the steady-state levels of CRTC1 and HBx decreased only slightly when the cells were treated with MG132 (Figure 7F, lane 4 compared to 3), implicating a role for proteosome in the stabilization effect. However, the expression of ubiquitin-K0 abrogated this stabilization effect almost completely (Figure 7F, lane 5 compared to 1\u20134). Although there was no simple interpretation to this result, one possibility is that mono- or multi-ubiquitination of HBx and CRTC1 might promote their proteosomal degradation. Plausibly, the stability of HBx and CRTC1 might be governed by multiple mechanisms involving ubiquitination, proteosome and lysosome.",

Our demonstration of CRTC activation of the preS2 but not the X promoter of HBV (Figure 2) supports the notion that the coactivator function of CRTCs in HBV transcription is also promoter context dependent. Although the exact promoter context that governs CRTC requirement is not currently understood, a comparison of the preS2 and X promoters sheds some light on this issue. Noteworthily, there are two consecutive CREs in the preS2 promoter, both of which are required for optimal activation by CRTC1 (Figure 5). In contrast, only one single CRE has been found in the X promoter (11). Further experiments should therefore be performed to determine whether this difference in the number of CREs might be decisive in promoter responsiveness to CRTCs.",

We also showed the recruitment of CRTCs to cccDNA and preS2-CRE in pHBV1.3D-transfected cells (Figure 2). These findings support a more direct involvement of CRTCs in HBV transcription from cccDNA. However, an indirect stimulatory role of CRTC2 on the core promoter mediated through PGC1\u03b1 has also been suggested (13). We also observed a modest activation of the preS1 and core promoters by all three CRTCs (Supplementary Figure S1). However, since no CRE has been found in these promoters, their general and mild activation by CRTCs is likely mediated indirectly through a CREB-regulated gene such as PGC1\u03b1. Thus, the influence of CRTCs on HBV transcription might be exerted through both direct activation as demonstrated in our study and an indirect effect as suggested for CRTC2 (13). Particularly, the stimulatory effect of CRTCs on pgRNA expression (Figure 3) could be mediated through the core promoter.",

The structural interface of CRTC2 for recognition and coactivation of CREB has been determined (38). In addition, the regulation of CRTC2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by upstream kinases has also been characterized (39). Plausibly, CRTC1 would use a similar interface to recognize CREB and CRTC1 activity would be regulated by the same protein kinases in the context of HBV transcription. It is noteworthy that small molecule activators and inhibitors of LKB1 and its downstream protein kinases, including metformin and salicylate, have been well documented (16,40). We have recently shown that LKB1 and its downstream kinases potently suppress transcriptional activity of CRTC1 and CREB in the context of human T-cell leukemia type 1 virus infection. In addition, the activation of these kinases using small molecule agonists such as metformin exhibits strong antiretroviral effects (27). By the same token, our characterization of the role of CRTCs in HBV life cycle will pave the way for further investigations on pharmacological inhibition of HBV transcription.",

            "text": "The mutual stabilization of HBX and CRTC1/2 in HBV-infected cells (Figure 7) is attributed at least in part to their interaction (Figure 6). This stabilization unlikely occurs at the mRNA level since CRTC mRNAs remained unchanged in pHBV1.3D-transfected cells (Figure 1C) in which HBx was abundantly expressed (Figure 1B). In addition, the stabilization of HBx was seen not only when it was expressed from a plasmid in transfected HepG2 cells but also when it was expressed in HepG2.2.15 cells from its own promoter in the HBV genome (Figure 7), which is not responsive to CRTCs (Figure 2). The mechanism by which HBx and CRTC1/2 proteins mutually stabilize each other warrants further study. First, the functional domains in HBx and CRTC1/2 that mediate their interaction and stabilization should be determined. CRTC3 is more divergent from CRTC1/2 and smaller in size; comparative analysis might reveal why CRTC3 was not stabilized by HBx (Figure 7). Although CRTC2 level was elevated in HepG2 cells expressing HBx (Figure 7), it was unchanged in HepG2.2.15 or pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 1). Further investigations are required to resolve this discrepancy and to clarify whether and how other viral proteins might affect CRTC2 protein expression. Second, the slow-migrating form of HBx detected in the presence of CRTC1/2/3 (Figure 7) should be further characterized. Particularly, whether it represented mono- or multi-ubiquitinated HBx should be clarified. Finally, exactly how stability of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells would be regulated through ubiquitination and proteolysis should be clarified. HBx has previously been shown to stabilize AIB1 oncoprotein by preventing its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (42). In view of the minimal to mild effect of MG132 on the mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 (Figure 7), a role for polyubiquitination and proteosome was suggested. However, the abrogation of the mutual stabilization effect by ubiquitin-K0 pointed to another direction. This discrepancy should be resolved in future work. The possibility that HBx and CRTC1 might be mono- or multi-ubiquitinated and then degraded by the lysosome should be experimentally validated. Alternatively, K63-linked or other types of polyubiquitination of CRTC1 suppressed by ubiquitin-K0 might be required for its stabilization. Our data cannot exclude that multiple mechanisms might operate in the control of HBx and CRTC stability. Further investigations should be performed to determine the involvement of proteosome, lysosome and different types of ubiquitination in the destruction of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells.",

It raises one interesting possibility that compromising CRTC1 might destabilize cccDNA. Histone hypoacetylation is known to regulate cccDNA transcription (43). APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination has recently been shown to trigger specific degradation of cccDNA (8). Whether and how CRTC1 recruitment to cccDNA and its post-translational modifications might affect cccDNA stability and function merit further investigations.",
