            "text": "Inclusion body disease (IBD) is a transmissible, progressive, and ultimately fatal disease of snakes first described several decades ago (1\u20133). In captive boid snakes, IBD is the most commonly diagnosed disease of suspected viral origin, and there are no treatments or vaccines available. Animals diagnosed with IBD are recommended for euthanasia if there is a risk of transmission to other animals or if there is neurological involvement. It has been speculated that a retrovirus may cause IBD, but to date, no virus or other pathogen has been definitively characterized (3, 4) and no molecular diagnostic method exists. The origin of the disease\u2019s name and the basis for its diagnosis are large eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of cells of infected animals. A specific 68-kDa protein has been purified from infected tissues, but it is not clear whether this is a viral or endogenous protein or whether the inclusions are directly caused by infection (5). IBD has been described in a variety of species, but it has been best characterized in snakes in the families Boidae and Pythonidae, i.e., boas and pythons (3\u201310). The clinical and histological manifestations and progression of IBD differ in boid snakes and pythons (1, 3). In pythons, inclusion bodies are primarily found in cells of the central nervous system and clinical signs include abnormal body posture and movement. In boas, inclusions are found in tissues throughout the body and regurgitation is an additional characteristic clinical sign. Pythons typically succumb to disease more rapidly than do boas, which may survive for months or years after symptom onset if provided with supportive care. Although there is evidence that IBD is transmissible, the precise mode of transmission is unknown (3). Conclusive identification of an etiologic agent or agents has the potential to enable IBD treatments, vaccines, diagnostics, and prevention policies.",

The simple reason for this is that humans are animals, and many viruses that infect other animals also infect humans. Some of the most medically important human viral pathogens originated from animals or have animal reservoirs, including influenza viruses, HIV-1 and -2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, henipaviruses, West Nile virus, rabies virus, hantaviruses, filoviruses, and arenaviruses. Furthermore, animal viruses and their hosts often provide excellent models for the study of pathogenic mechanisms, immune response to infection, host-pathogen interactions, treatments, and vaccines.",

Metagenomic pathogen discovery techniques aim to identify pathogen nucleic acid in infected samples without bias. The first generation of such technologies included the Virochip microarray (14, 15). Now, high-throughput sequencing, such as the Illumina technology, is being increasingly used as its price decreases and throughput increases. The massive depth of sequence combined with increasingly capable assembly and search methods offers greater sensitivity to detect divergent pathogens than ever before. Ultimately, however, sequencing can only ever identify candidate etiologic agents, and demonstration of causality requires significant additional experimental effort.",

Snakes diagnosed as IBD positive as well as one snake (CAS04) that screened negative via blood smear but that had been housed with positive snakes were euthanized and necropsied.

Of these six animals, five had been diagnosed as IBD positive, and one (CAS04) was negative. Sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform generated approximately 1 \u00d7 108 pairs of 100-nucleotide (nt) sequences, on average ~6 million sequences for each of the 35 samples (no sample was available from the heart of snake CAS07). The complete data set for all samples is available from the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession no. SRA053624). To facilitate the search for viral sequences, we first removed low-quality, low-complexity, and host-derived sequences. To remove host sequences, including those deriving from possibly confounding endogenous retroviruses, we removed reads matching the recently sequenced boa constrictor genome (assembly no. 1 [16]). These operations reduced the size of the data sets by an average of 93%.",

This search revealed the presence of substantial numbers of sequences with similarity to arenavirus protein sequences in all of the IBD-diagnosed samples. We used these BLAST hits to nucleate complete genome assemblies using the PRICE de novo genome assembler (G. Ruby, freely available at http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/price/index.html). This analysis revealed that there were actually two distinct (59% pairwise nucleotide identity) but related viruses in the snakes from the aquarium: one from the IBD-positive annulated tree boas and one from the IBD-positive boa constrictors (Table 1; Fig. 2 and 3). We then used PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and Sanger sequencing to validate the assemblies. Retrospective mapping of the sequences revealed that the individual IBD-positive tissue data sets contained between 8,422 and 227,134 viral sequences (between 0.13% and 3.8% of the total reads). Overall genome coverage ranged from 825-fold to 3,335-fold (the average number of sequences covering each base). The complete genomes for both viral species are available from GenBank (accession numbers JQ717261 to JQ717264). The data sets from IBD-negative CAS04 contained very low frequencies of sequences mapping to the two viruses (<5 \u00d7 10\u22125), a phenomenon that was also observed for the boa constrictor virus in the annulated tree boa samples and vice versa. These low-copy-number sequences likely resulted from intersample cross-contamination or bar code misregistration during sequencing (18). This explanation was corroborated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), which demonstrated that all tissues of snake CAS04 were negative for viral RNA (there was no amplification) (Fig. 2). This analysis also confirmed that the two viruses segregated perfectly with the two snake species. By sequencing and by quantitative PCR (qPCR), viral RNA was detected in every tissue examined, a pattern reminiscent of the histopathological detection of inclusions in all of these tissues (Fig. 2).",

To investigate this possibility, we obtained and screened 21 additional samples from IBD-positive and -negative snakes of various species for viral RNA (Table 1). We performed RT-PCR with multiple sets of primers, including consensus primers designed to amplify sequence from both novel viruses, and by additional deep sequencing in some cases. A third related virus was detected by RT-PCR in a boa constrictor from Collierville, TN, diagnosed with IBD in 2008. Although the complete genome of this third virus has not yet been fully determined, alignments of the recovered sequences reveal that this third virus is more closely related (~80% nucleotide identity) to the virus recovered from the CAS boa constrictors (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Viral RNA was not detected in the other three confirmed IBD cases. Thus, 6/8 IBD-positive samples were positive for one of these divergent but related viruses. We did not detect viral RNA in any of 18 control samples (Table 1). These results show that multiple related arenavirus-like viruses are associated with geographically and temporally widespread IBD cases and also reveal a high degree of diversity in this clade. Until all available samples can be analyzed by deep sequencing, we cannot rule out the presence of additional divergent species in the samples that have tested negative by RT-PCR.",

The predicted GPs of CASV and GGV are 393 and 427 amino acids long and, like other class 1 viral fusion proteins, may be proteolytically cleaved into two functional domains: the GP1 receptor binding and the GP2 transmembrane/fusion domains (37, 38). Amino acids 222 to 393 of CASV GP and 256 to 427 of GGV GP are 82% identical. This relatively conserved domain likely corresponds to the GP2 domain and was the region with detectable similarity by BLAST. Using HHPred, the top hit for this domain of both CASV and GGV was to the Sudan Ebola virus GP2 (PDB accession no. 3S88; probability of homologous relationships, 99.98%). Like filovirus GP2s, the CASV and GGV domains are predicted to form C-terminal transmembrane domains that anchor the protein in the viral membrane. In contrast to the relatively conserved GP2 domain, the predicted N-terminal GP1 domains of CASV and GGV glycoproteins are only 31% identical, and neither domain contains detectable homology to known proteins (by BLASTP versus nr with an E value of <1).

Viral RNA levels in culture supernatant were monitored by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA was initially detectable in the supernatant but rapidly disappeared as culture medium was replaced and was undetectable by 7 days postinoculation and over the course of 18 days. We observed similar negative results with an African green monkey-derived Vero cell line, known to be permissive for the replication of many arenaviruses. This suggested that these lines or the culture conditions were not permissive for replication or that the inoculum that we used lacked replication-competent virus.",

First, for previously described arenaviruses, NP is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells and is the most antigenic viral protein in vivo (21). Second, the predicted molecular mass of this protein (67 kDa) is similar to the reported mass (68 kDa) of an abundant protein specific to IBD-positive tissues (5).

Many eosinophilic inclusions stained brightly with NP while others appeared to be ringed by NP fluorescence (closed and open arrowheads in Fig. 6). This could be explained by differential cross-sectioning of the inclusions during tissue sectioning, for instance, if the inclusions were roughly spherical and coated with NP protein. In this scenario, in equatorial cross sections the NP fluorescence would ring the inclusions. And if the section captured the top or bottom surface of the inclusion, then the fluorescence would appear as filled circles. Alternatively, there may be multiple, structurally distinct types of inclusions, or inclusions may be differentially accessible to antibody during staining.",

These viruses share a typical arenavirus-like genome organization, but the protein sequences of Z and GPC imply a more complicated evolutionary relationship to previously characterized arenaviruses. These viruses were detected in 6/8 snakes with confirmed IBD diagnoses and 0/18 IBD-negative animals. In infected animals, viral RNA and protein were detected in tissues with cytoplasmic inclusions, and indeed, viral nucleoprotein was found to localize to the same eosinophilic inclusions that give the disease its name. Although formal confirmation that these novel arenavirus-like agents cause disease in snakes will require experimental challenge studies, their detection in reptiles raises an array of intriguing questions about the host range, evolution, basic biology, and mechanisms of pathogenesis associated with this unusual branch of the virus phylogeny.",

However, when arenaviruses zoonotically infect humans or other mammals, severe disease can result. Scientific study has focused on these viruses for two principal reasons: (i) some of these viruses (e.g., LASV) can cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans, and (ii) the arenavirus LCMV provides an excellent tool to study the immune response in its natural host, Mus musculus (43).

There are several possible models to explain the configurations of the extant arenavirus species. One possibility is that the GPC gene of the arenavirus common ancestor was more similar to the GPC gene of CASV and GGV and therefore to those of filoviruses and avian retroviruses (Fig. 7A). In this scenario, recombination or significant divergence occurred on the lineage leading to the Old World (OW) and New World (NW) arenaviruses. An alternate model is that the GP gene of the ancestral arenavirus was similar to that of the present-day rodent arenaviruses and may itself have derived from an ancestor common with the filoviruses (Fig. 7B). Then, along the lineage leading to snake arenaviruses, recombination with a filovirus or retrovirus introduced a new GP gene. Intrasegmental recombination between arenaviruses leading to speciation has been documented, so a precedent for these models exists (46).",

In contrast, the snake from Tennessee that was diagnosed as IBD and arenavirus positive (Table 1) was diagnosed in a postmortem exam. This snake had produced a clutch of infertile eggs (slugs), developed dysecdysis (incomplete shedding), continued to decline, and ultimately died. It is clear that arenavirus infection does result in large viral protein-containing inclusions, a diagnostic finding believed to be prognostic of a fatal outcome, although disease progression has proven variable, with animals surviving for weeks to months after first clinical manifestation, and with the caveat that \u201cIBD\u201d in different snake species may ultimately prove attributable to different causes.",

Snakes eat rodents; thus, another possibility is that these viruses are transmitted when snakes eat infected mice or rats. This possibility is not unprecedented: \u201ccallitrichid hepatitis virus\u201d was originally identified as the agent responsible for outbreaks of fatal hepatitis in captive marmosets and tamarins in zoos (47).

There are a number of other possible causes of the pathology observed in these cases. One obvious alternative is infection by other viruses not detected by our methods, including additional divergent arenaviruses. A precedent for this possibility is the case of avian proventricular dilatation disease, where follow-up studies identified numerous additional genogroups of avian bornavirus, the causative agent (15, 51\u201354). Deep sequencing of additional IBD-positive samples will help resolve this question. Alternatively, infection by nonviral pathogens may be responsible in some cases, though we did not detect any obvious such organisms in our metagenomic analyses. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic inclusions may be a by-product of some other disease state or cellular stress, although the localization of viral nucleoprotein to these inclusions that we observed would appear to contradict this alternate hypothesis. Expanded association studies will more firmly determine the proportion of IBD cases attributable to arenavirus infection and may identify etiologic agents responsible for nonarenavirus IBD diagnoses.",

IBD is currently diagnosed by relatively insensitive blood analysis or invasive biopsy and histopathology. Viral RNA was as abundant in blood cells as in infected tissues (Fig. 2), so RT-PCR using RNA purified from whole blood is the approach offering the best combination of specificity, sensitivity, and ease of sample collection, though proper controls and procedures will have to be used to minimize the possibility of PCR false positives due to contamination. Primers targeting the region of the genomes conserved among the three viruses described here are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Antibodies against viral proteins offer an additional diagnostic approach, but antibodies against conserved viral epitopes would have to be generated and validated.",

While the specific mode of transmission is unknown, it is likely that the elimination of diseased snakes will greatly reduce the likelihood of transmission, even if there exists an intermediate vector. The availability of a diagnostic test, whether by RT-PCR or by virus-specific antibodies, will prevent the introduction of infected, but possibly asymptomatic, snakes into healthy collections. Ultimately, diagnostically driven surveillance by veterinarians will likely identify outbreaks or hot spots of the disease and perhaps one day lead to adequate control of this previously vexing condition. Furthermore, vaccines exist or are in development for some arenaviruses (21, 55\u201357), and ribavirin and other drugs have been shown to be effective in decreasing the severity of disease caused by hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses (21, 58, 59).

The first 6 bases of each sequence, corresponding to the random hexamer used to tag library molecules, were trimmed from sequences. Snake sequences were then filtered using the BLASTN alignment tool (version 2.2.21 [17]) to query a database composed of a draft (assembly 1) of the boa constrictor genome (16).

This filtering removed between 90 and 97% of sequences. The remaining sequences were searched against databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTX algorithm, and sequences matching any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 2 were further examined. False positives were eliminated by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases.
