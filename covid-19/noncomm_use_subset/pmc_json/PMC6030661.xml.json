The authors found that a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear or culture was associated with a higher mortality rate, while a higher arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level was associated with increased survival. Ryu et al.4 evaluated 169 patients with TDL and found that extensive lung destruction was the only independent predictor of reduced survival, although only 50 patients (30%) in the cohort had required mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory failure secondary to TDL is associated with high rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, which may burden the limited resources of developing countries56. Early identification of patients with a high risk of mortality, and the selection of individuals who might benefit from ICU care, would therefore facilitate health care planning. However, no scoring system for mortality risk is available for TDL patients on mechanical ventilation.",

Active infection was defined as the presence in a blood culture or adequate sputum culture, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoscopy sample of a pneumonia pathogen (bacteria, including tuberculosis; a virus; or a fungus). To evaluate the extent of disease involvement, baseline chest X-rays were graded on a 4-point scale (field score 1\u20134) using a radiographic scoring method described elsewhere4910. First, four zones were demarcated by dividing each lung into two equal-sized zones (upper and lower) on a frontal radiograph. In each of the four zones, the following scoring system was then applied: (1) 0, no abnormality; (2) 1, when less than 25% of lung parenchyma showed destructive lung lesions; and (3) 2, 3, or 4, respectively, when destroyed lung lesions involved 25%\u201350%, 50%\u201375%, or >75% of lung parenchyma. The field score was then calculated as the mean disease involvement of the two lungs. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal values. The FVC and FEV1 values were calculated using Korean equations, which were based on data from a non-smoking population with normal chest radiograph findings and no history of lung disease or symptoms. In these equations, the predicted value is adjusted in accordance with age, sex, height, and weight11. Cor pulmonale was diagnosed on the basis of both clinical and echocardiographic findings12. Echocardiographic signs of cor pulmonale comprised right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy or dilation accompanying high RV systolic pressure (> 35 mm Hg)1213.",

The optimal cut-off values for potential predictors of ICU mortality were selected using either the median value or locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves14, as appropriate. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting ICU mortality. Variables with p-values of <0.20 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and model calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The \u03b2 coefficient values derived from multiple logistic regression were simplified to natural numbers >0, and the TDL-Vent score was calculated as the sum of these simplified values. To predict 60-day survival, Kaplan-Meier estimates were stratified according to the TDL-Vent score, and curves were compared using the log-rank test. The AUC for the TDL-Vent score predicting ICU mortality was compared with that for the APACHE II score and the SOFA score. Identification of an optimal cut-off value for the score was based on the maximum Youden's index15. All tests of significance were two-tailed, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.

            "text": "Several previous investigations of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and acute respiratory failure reported high rates of in-hospital mortality. Risk factors associated with mortality vary between studies. However, the most frequently reported risk factors are the requirement for mechanical ventilation, sepsis, organ failure, nosocomial pneumonia, and delayed treatment32021. TDL patients presenting with acute respiratory failure have a poor prognosis. However, few studies have investigated prognostic factors in such patients. Previous studies show that AFB-positive TDL patients have more severe lung destruction and higher mortality rates than AFB-negative patients222, while a higher level of PaCO2 has been associated with increased survival2. Ryu et al.4 found that a high field score was the only predictor of reduced survival, although patients with high field scores showed higher PaCO2. The aforementioned studies investigated small cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients, and their results were inconsistent. The main strength of the present study was its relatively large cohort, which was restricted to patients requiring mechanical ventilation. This enabled the development of an individualized mortality prediction score for this specific population. An interesting and unexpected finding of the present study was the lack of association between the degree of lung destruction, tuberculosis activity, or the level of PaCO2 and increased mortality. Instead, the prognostic factors in the present cohort were age and evidence of organ failure (vasopressor use and PaO2/FiO2 <180), as suggested in other patient populations. These risk factors are consistent with those reported in previous studies of active pulmonary tuberculosis with acute respiratory failure32021, thus supporting the hypothesis that lower physiologic reserve and organ dysfunction, rather than the destroyed lung per se, are better predictors of mortality in mechanically ventilated TDL patients. A low serum albumin level also correlated with mortality in active pulmonary tuberculosis with acute respiratory failure23. In this study, nonsurvivors had lower levels of serum albumin than survivors, although this trend did not reach statistical significance. In the present cohort, the TDL-Vent score (both model 1 and model 2) was superior in terms of discriminating between survivors and non-survivors than either the APACHE II score or the SOFA score. In addition, the score from model 1 showed very high specificity in patients with the highest risk of mortality, thus limiting the possibility of misclassifying a patient as very high risk. This is crucial, as such a classification may result in the decision to withhold or withdraw life support. Lastly, the clinician is able to calculate the TDL-Vent score at the bedside, rather than relying on complicated formulas, smear tests, or chest X-rays.",

Second, in attempting to identify risk factors for mortality, high specificity was obtained at the expense of lower sensitivity, as a substantial proportion of patients who died did not have a high TDL-Vent score. Third, a substantial number of patients were excluded from the echocardiography and pulmonary function analyses due to missing data.
