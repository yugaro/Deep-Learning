            "text": "Recent years evidence an exponential increase in the number of papers on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), indicating that the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder is becoming a popular research topic. This point is also reflected in the articles of the \u201cDigested Disorder\u201d series published in this journal.1-3 To make this point stronger some interesting numbers are provided below. PubMed search (as of August 03, 2014) for ((intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) returned 2,490 hits. Restricting this search to the past one and a half years only (i.e., searching for ((intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) AND (\u201c2013/01/01\u201d[Date - Publication]: \u201c3000\u201d[Date - Publication])) gives 659 hits. Curiously, although papers on IDPs (2,490) constitute just 0.045% of all the protein-related papers (5,569,481) published during the past 115 years, the fraction of IDP-related papers increases to 0.18% if only publications of the past year and a half are taken into account. It is of interest to compare these trends with the related tendencies of the research on proteins in general. Protein-related papers (5,569,481) constitute \u223c23% of all the papers published during the past 115 y and annotated in PubMed (24,068,783). However, this number decreases to \u223c21% if only papers published during the past year and a half are taken into account (in 2013\u20132014, the overall number of published papers is 1,719,568; the number of papers dealing with proteins is 362,612). This suggests that an IDP is a new rising star in the field of protein science.",

            "text": "Despite this steady and sure increase in the appreciation of protein intrinsic disorder, there are still numerous instances when this concept is overlooked, or missed or simply ignored. Unfortunately, such \u201cmissed disorder\u201d phenomenon continues to be rather common in the modern literature. The original goal of the first article in the new \u201cUnreported disorder in proteins\u201d series was to find several papers published in different journals that talk about IDPs (or hybrid proteins containing both ordered and disordered regions) not recognizing that they are talking about such proteins, to show how consideration of intrinsic disorder can be used to strengthen conclusions and draw relationships to prior discoveries in the field. However, analysis of recent publications in just 2 journals revealed that the \u201cmissed disorder\u201d happened to be essentially more abundant than it was originally expected. In fact, as of August 3, 2014, of 677 papers published during 2013\u20132014 in the Journal of Molecular Biology, 609 were dealing with proteins, with 87 papers being dedicated to the IDPs or hybrid proteins. Papers were considered to be dealing with intrinsic disorder if their texts contained at least a single mention of disorder, flexibility, conformational flexibility, or unfoldedness in relation to the protein of interest or any of its regions. Obviously, this is a very relaxed and inclusive approach, since simple mentioning of disorder or conformational flexibility is not sufficient for the detailed elucidation of the functional role of disorder/flexibility. The direct PubMed search for the IDP-related papers published in the Journal of Molecular Biology using the search criteria ((intrinsic disorder) OR (intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) AND (\u201c2013/01/01\u201d[Date - Publication]: \u201c3000\u201d[Date - Publication]) AND (\u201cJournal of Molecular Biology\u201d[Journal]) generated just 17 hits. Analysis of the table of content of this journal combined with a brief computational analysis of related proteins revealed that there are at least 22 more papers, research subject of which are IDPs. Analogous analysis of the publications in Biochemistry during the 2013\u20132014 provided comparable data: of 1455 published papers, 25 were \u201cofficially\u201d dedicated to intrinsic disorder or to intrinsically disordered/natively unfolded/intrinsically unstructured/intrinsically unfolded/intrinsically flexible proteins. Mining of papers published in Biochemistry during 2013\u20132014 revealed that some 189 papers contained at least a single mention of \u201cconformational flexibility\u201d OR \u201cintrinsic disorder\u201d OR \u201cdisordered protein\u201d OR \u201cdisordered peptide\u201d OR \u201cdisordered region\u201d OR \u201cnatively unfolded\u201d in relation to the protein of interest or any of its regions. Furthermore, based on the combination of literature mining and a brief computational analysis 20 \u201chidden gems\u201d were found; i.e., papers that missed protein disorder.",

In the first step of this process, the eIF4F complex binds to the m7Gppp cap on the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA. This eIF4F complex consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A.6,7 At the next steps of the translation initiation, the eIF4F complex recruits the 43S ribosomal pre-initiation complex which scans the 5\u2032-untranslated region in 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction in search for the translation start codon.8,9 One of the important points in this process is the resolution of secondary and tertiary structures in the mRNA, which is typically done by the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A, which possesses RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities.10 These 2 activities of eIF4A are enhanced by some auxiliary proteins, such as eIF4B and eIF4G that act synergistically stimulating the eIF4A helicase activity in the mRNA scanning process.5",

An important feature of PAI-1 is its ability to exist in 2 forms, a metastable active conformation with solvent-accessible reactive center loop (RCL) and thermodynamically stable, inactive, latent conformation, where RCL is spontaneously inserted to the middle of the \u03b2-sheet B of PAI-1.17 This \u201cmagic\u201d chameleon-like RCL is located in the 331\u2013350 region. Figure 2A shows that although human PAI-1 (UniProt ID: P05121) is predicted to be mostly ordered, its RCL is located within grayish area with a mean disorder score close to 0.5, suggesting that this region is characterized by noticeable intrinsic mobility.\n\n",

In the absence of this interaction, the ssDNA annealing and ATP-dependent translocation activities of UvsW are severely inhibited when gp32 coats the ssDNA lattice.

The gp32 is also thought to coordinate the many activities necessary to carry out DNA replication, recombination and repair by recruiting and modulating the activity of the enzymes involved in these processes.28 The bacteriophage T4 gp32 (UniProt ID: P03695) is a 301 residue-long protein. The crystal structure of the gp32 central region (residues 22\u2013239) is known (see Fig. 3C).29 Gp32 binds preferentially to ssDNA and destabilizes double-stranded DNA. It is involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination, dinds ssDNA as the replication fork advances and stimulates the replisome processivity and accuracy. The N-terminal region of gp32 is important for the cooperative binding of gp32 monomers on ssDNA, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail is involved interaction with the replicative DNA polymerase, the primase and helicase loader protein.30-32 Also, this C-terminal region (residues 254\u2013301) was shown to play a crucial role in controlling the D-loop unwinding capability of UvsW, since the presence of a mutant gp32 protein lacking the acidic tail (delta254\u2013301, gp32-A) led to a significant reduction in the unwinding of the D-loop substrate.18\nFig. 3D shows that a significant portion of the C-terminal half of this protein is predicted to be mostly disordered (residues 200\u2013301). Curiously, this disordered region includes the functionally important C-terminal tail that defines the ability of gp32 to modulate the UvsW activity.",

This is a highly species conserved protein consisting of 3 distinct domains: a variable N-terminal domain that contains an amphipathic helix and a leucine zipper region, a highly conserved central domain containing a \u201cradical SAM domain,\u201d and a conserved C-terminal critical for the antiviral properties of viperin against a number of viruses.58 The authors showed that viperin plays a role in innate immune signaling, limits different viruses through both direct inhibition of replication and interference with viral budding/release, and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton to increase infectivity of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a known example of evolutionary escape of HCMV from the antiviral properties of viperin.58 Viperin is able to interact with the 5 host proteins FPPS, TFP, IRAK1, VAP-A and TRAF6 and the 3 viral proteins DENV NS3, HCV NS5A and HCMV vMIA in order to accomplish these diverse biological functions.58\nFigure 6A represents the results of the STRING59-based evaluation of viperin interactivity.

Several recent studies indicated that both N- and C-tails of this protein are intrinsically disordered.75-77 Furthermore, it has been emphasized that post-translational modifications, conserved eukaryotic linear motifs, and molecular recognition features are present in the disordered C-tail of PTEN, enhancing protein-protein interactions of this protein needed for the various cellular functions of PTEN.75",

Similar to L5, Pukovnik Xis stimulates integrase-mediated excision and inhibits integration.80,81 The presence of both Xis and intergrase is needed for the formation of an attR intasome.78 The cooperative binding of several Xis proteins to DNA is driven by a winged-helix motif and relies on the use of contacts between a central loop and the wing motif to mediate interactions between Xis proteins when bound to DNA leading to the formation of a micronucleoprotein filament with a modest bend.78,82,83",

Within the asymmetric unit, the filament region contains 4 Xis protomers whereas the fifth protomer is positioned adjacent to the filament. This \u201coutside\u201d protomer forms the domain-swapped complex with the Xis protomer 3. This domain-swapped Xis pair is created due to a dramatic rearrangement within the loop connecting \u03b21 and \u03b22 (residues 36\u201339) allowing the C-terminal residues 40\u201356 of one subunit to interact with the N-terminal 35 residues of a neighboring Xis monomer.78 It has been emphasized that the most important protein-protein interactions mediating the filament formation are formed by residues 51\u201354 of Pukovnik Xis that make extensive contacts with the wing of the adjacent monomer and deletion of which greatly diminishes DNA binding affinity and abolishes excision.78 Therefore, although the Xis filament is composed of identical subunits, the individual Xis protomers are involved in very different interactions and form very different interfaces. To further illustrate this point, Figure 7A represents a crystal structure of the Pukovnik Xis pentamer (PDB ID: 4J2N) and 4 pairs of different dimers found within this pentameric filament. Figure 7B shows that Pukovnik Xis (UniProt ID: B3VGI6) is predicted to contain substantial amount of intrinsic disorder (note scale of the Y-axis), including disordered N- and C-terminal tails. Therefore, it is likely that the intrinsically disordered nature determines the ability of this small protein to be involved in a complex net of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, including its ability to form a wide array of regular and domain-swapped dimers.\n\n",

Next, the preprimosome is recognized by the primase, and a functional primosome is formed. The DnaT protein is crucial for the specific entry of the DnaB helicase into the primosome complex. 92-94",

RS domains of SR proteins can range from 50 to over 300 residues in length, and the Arg\u2013Ser dipeptide repeats can vary in both length and position.

Here, RyRs resides in close proximity to plasma membrane voltage-gated dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and respond to the DHPR activity through a direct interaction and/or indirect Ca2+ sensitivity, propagating sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+ release, thereby playing an integral role in excitation\u2013contraction coupling in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes.114,115 Mutations in the RyR genes are associated with several heritable human diseases, with most disease-associated mutations making RyRs hypersensitive to activating stimuli such as Ca2+ on either the luminal or the cytosolic side of the receptor. In one of such mutations, the removal of exon 3 in RyR2 (RyR2A\u03943) results in a 35-residue deletion (N57-G91) that does not destabilize the protein.116,117 Earlier structural analysis revealed that the \u03b2-trefoil fold of this domain is rescued by the transformation of the part of the preceding region of unknown structure (residues 88\u2013109) into the missing \u03b2-strand leading to the noticeable increase in the thermal stability of the RyR2A\u03943 domain.117 Using solution NMR analysis, Amador et al. showed that this \u201cpart of the preceding region of unknown structure\u201d corresponds to a previously unresolved \u03b12-helix (residues 95\u2013104) in the wild-type RyR2A.113 Curiously, this \u03b1-helix undergoes structural transformation to a \u03b2-strand, thereby rescuing the \u03b2-strand deleted in the RyR2A\u03943 due to the removal of 3 in RyR2 gene. Therefore, the authors revealed that this newly discovered \u03b12-helix corresponds to the region of missing electron density in the earlier crystal structures of the protein, is rather dynamic, exhibits a greater backbone RMSD compared to the remaining secondary structure elements, and is able to undergo an \u03b1-to-\u03b2 transition after the deletion of residues N57-G91 in RyR2A\u03943.113 In other words, applying NMR to look at the crystallographically invisible region, an important chameleon region was discovered. Although this chameleon region is relatively small, it is really mighty, with at least some mightiness being attributed to its intrinsically disordered nature.",

The members of the class III Semaphorin (Sema3) family of axon guidance molecules are among the ligands neuropilins (Nrps). Ligand binding of Nrps is a subject of the intensive research due to the involvement of these transmembrane receptors in various pathogenic conditions. It has been established that all known Nrp ligands require a C-terminal arginine (CR) for binding to a conserved pocket in the Nrp b1 domain.144-147 To better understand the mechanism of interaction between the Nrps and their ligands and to understand the role of residues upstream of the CR, Parker et al. synthesized a library of semaphorin-3 derived peptides. This study revealed that the C-1 residue (i.e., residue preceding the CR) serves the critical role of positioning the CR and C-2 residues to promote concurrent Nrp binding.143 Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the analyzed sequence (WDQKKPRNRR) is a part of long intrinsically disordered tail that spans over the last 100 residues of human semaphorin-3 (UniProt ID: Q13275, see Fig. 9F).",

Although this approach permitted better realization of the \u03b1-helix-forming potential of the non-modified osteocalcin, the crystallization conditions are clearly non-physiological.",

Search of UniProt for human defensins produces about 40 hits, of which 6 entries were \u03b1-defensins. Defensins are produced in a form of proprotein containing a signal peptide and/or a propeptide. Figure 15 represents disorder profile for several representative members of the human defensin family and shows that all proproteins possess noticeable amount of intrinsic disorder, the content of which varies significantly between different defensins. It is likely that the presence of noticeable disordered tails plays a role in the maturation of defensins since sites of the proteolytic attack are commonly located within regions of intrinsic disorder.177 It is also possible that these disordered tails serve as entropic bristle domains178 defining solubility of pro-defensins. In \u03b2-defensins, long disordered regions can have other functions. For example, the ANCHOR analysis15,16 of human \u03b2-defensin 129 (UniProt ID: Q9H1M3) revealed that this longest member of the human defensin family (there are 129 amino acids in a mature protein and 183 residues in a pro-protein) contains 4 AiBSs, residues 78\u201387, 89\u2013100, 117\u2013122, and 149\u2013164.\n\n",

This analysis revealed that there are 10 AiBSs in LGN (residues 370\u2013379, 436\u2013452, 491\u2013499, 508\u2013513, 531\u2013537, 545\u2013553, 566\u2013573, 596\u2013607, 629\u2013638 and 661\u2013671), whereas Frmpd1 contains 23 AiBSs (residues 534\u2013554, 609\u2013617, 622\u2013636, 652\u2013662, 704\u2013715, 747\u2013779, 792\u2013804, 828\u2013878, 896\u2013909, 932\u2013949, 958\u2013967, 983\u20131019, 1023\u20131077, 1087\u20131100, 1106\u20131114, 1119\u20131129, 1138\u20131171, 1192\u20131220, 1245\u20131250, 1290\u20131297, 1312\u20131319, 1336\u20131342, and 1424\u20131431).

According to the ANCHOR analysis, there are 3 AiBSs in both proteins (residues 15\u201321, 158\u2013164, and 221\u2013230 in human protein, and residues 13\u201318, 173\u2013204, and 207\u2013230 in mouse ApoA-I). Figure 21C represents a structure of the human ApoA-I dimer in a complex with lipids (PDB ID: 3K2S). This model was built by uniting several synergistic experimental techniques, such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation, isotopic deuteration of selected macromolecule components, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange tandem mass spectrometry (HD-MS/MS).237 In agreement with the results of disorder predictions, the ApoA-I dimer represents a highly intertwined double superhelix with a minimal number of intrachain contacts, which is stabilized mostly by the interchain interactions. In other words, this complex is characterized by a very large interface area, and, therefore, according to Gunasekaran et al.238 it belong to the category of 2-state dimers, where the monomers are unfolded in the unbound state and fold simultaneously with the complex formation.\n\n",

MAVS can be regulated by host cell factors that inhibit MAVS signaling by direct protein\u2013protein interactions, by altering mitochondrial properties or dynamics, or by post-translational modifications.239 The tip of the MAVS C-terminus contains a mitochondrial intermembrane region (residues 535\u2013540) needed for the interaction with the mitochondrial membrane. According to UniProt, human MAVS (UniProt ID: Q7Z434) is involved in a wide array of protein-protein interactions. Among established MAVS binding proteins are: DDX58/RIG-I, IFIH1/MDA5, TRAF2, TRAF6, C1QBP, IRF3, FADD, RIPK1, CHUK, IKBKB, HCV and hepatitis GB virus B NS3/4A proteases, HHAV protein 3ABC, NLRX1, PSMA7, TRAFD1, PCBP2, IPS1, ITCH, CYLD, SRC, DHX58/LGP2, DDX58/RIG-I, IKBKE, TMEM173/MITA, IFIT3, TBK1, and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) NS1 protein (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z434).

In crystal structure, GerD60-180 trimer consists of 3 parallel polypeptide chains twisted into a superhelical, right-handed rope (PDB ID: 4O8W).241 In this elongated trimer, each of the individual GerD60-180 chains forms 8 helices (H1 to H8) linked by short turns. Structures of the individual chains can be superimposed on each other except to the loosely packed H8 helices. Helices H1\u2013H7 in each GerD60-180 chain twist around the central axis to form 2 complete turns of a right-handed supercoil with a pitch of \u223c44\u212b.

Pup is obviously a highly disordered protein that partially folds at binding. In fact, of 68 residues used in the crystallization experiment, only 31 are visible in structure, whereas remaining 37 residues (1\u201320 and 52\u201368) are located within the regions of missing electron density. According to the ANCHOR analysis, Pup possesses 2 disorder-based binding regions, residues 1\u201315 and 34\u201364. Curiously, Forer et al. suggested that Pup has 2 binding sites for RafA located at residues 38\u201347 and 51\u201358, and that the first RafA binding site is overlapped with the region responsible for the Mpa binding (residues 21\u201351).247\n\n",

An intrigue here is in the fact that htRNALys3UUU is one of the most uniquely processed tRNAs that has a broad spectrum of chemically different post-transcriptional modifications playing crucial roles in regulation of the conformation and function of this tRNA during protein synthesis.252 Using phage display approach, Spears et al. showed that p7 contains a specific htRNALys3UUU\u2013binding region whose interaction with fully modified tRNA can be mimicked by the 15- and 16-amino acid peptides with the signature sequence of R-W-Q/N-H-X2-F-Pho-X-G/A-W-R-X2-G (where X can be most amino acids, and Pho is any hydrophobic residue).251",

Consequently, it coats the genomic RNA protecting it from nucleases and compacting viral RNA within the core. Protein p7 also serves as an RNA chaperone that enhances several nucleic acid-dependent steps of viral life, such as melting RNA secondary structures, promoting DNA strand exchange reactions during reverse transcription,256-258 and stimulating integration.259",
