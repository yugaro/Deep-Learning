Recent outbreaks of infectious disease such as Ebola Virus Disease and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) demonstrated the need for effective collaboration among countries responding to stop rapid transmission of such diseases [1, 2]. There are several mechanisms and initiatives to facilitate international cooperation to address such crises. The International Health Regulations (IHR), which entered into force in 2007 and are led by the World Health Organization (WHO), requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. These reporting requirements help the international community prevent and respond to public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide [3]. The U.S. is also leading an international effort to integrate its biodefense strategy for preempting an outbreak and has committed to partner with other countries in order to achieve the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) goal of preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats [4].",

An AR Biological Defense Task Force (BDTF) was established in 2012 to prioritize, track, and implement approved recommendations captured in After Action Reports from each AR exercise. In the past several years, the AR Initiative has increased awareness and improved coordination activities between the U.S. and ROK and, more importantly, across the ROK government and defense agencies.

The second incident was an open-air release at a Convention Center in City B in South Korea. The incidents occurred eight days apart and resulted in numerous ROK, U.S. and foreign citizen casualties and deaths. The number of patients from both attacks reached over 600, resulting in about 35 fatalities. The scenario triggered a large coordinated response, with particular emphasis on public messaging, information sharing and resource request processes.

Effective risk communication during a biological event can have profound effects. A basic goal of public health communication is to provide accurate, accessible information so that a bond of trust can be established between the responding agency and those potentially affected by the event [8]. This trust may be affected by perception on the competence, objectivity, fairness, and consistency of the responding agency and highly depend on the general belief in the good will of the agency [9]. Risk communication during a biological event should closely involve the affected community through clear messaging. Individualized approaches are needed to ensure that the customized messages are delivered appropriately to diverse populations [10, 11]. In an era when the public has far-reaching access to social media mostly via smart phones, governments will be challenged to provide accurate, timely information to the public before inaccurate information and rumors become widespread. To implement more effective risk communication, government crisis message planning and preparation should take place well before an event.",

For example, participants could actually be given a task to investigate and review mock medical records. Depending on an agency\u2019s duties, participating organizations would perform analysis of laboratory specimens, interview patients, conduct meetings to assess surveillance data and decide on the next steps, draft public health and executive orders, make written requests to other agencies for specific assistance or information, participate in news conferences, and distribute mock antibiotics or vaccines at a public health clinic.",

The ROK-U.S. bilateral exercise AR14 confirmed that \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 response to complex biological events could only be achieved when there is continuing, multilateral coordination and cooperation in all of the processes of prevention, detection, and response. Enhancing the current biosurveillance capabilities of both countries can best be achieved by incorporating a more realistic response in future scenarios by integrating a tactical response episode in the exercise. Practical benefits gained through AR14 will further equip both countries with essential capacities in \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 response to biological events.",
