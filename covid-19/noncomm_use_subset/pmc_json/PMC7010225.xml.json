Next-generation sequencing has improved the efficiency of oncogene testing by high-throughput sequencing, which can detect dozen of mutations at the same time, but the high-cost of this technique limits its clinical usage (13,14).

This method is performed under isothermal conditions, thereby enabling rapid amplification. Due to the high specificity and rapid detection quality of LAMP, this method has been widely used in the fields of bacteriology (16) and virology (17,18). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies reporting the value of LAMP in determining EGFR mutations. Therefore, the present study aimed to detect EGFR mutations in surgically resected tumor tissues from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma using this method, as detection of EGFR mutations is one a key examination for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (4,5,7,9).

All pathological diagnosis was determined on the basis of the WHO classification version 8 (19) by an expert pathologist, who normally makes a diagnosis using HE-stained slides using light microscope (Nikon Co., ECLIPSE Ni-u) from a low magnification to a high magnification. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Surgically resected tissue of primary lung cancer; ii) pulmonary adenocarcinoma; iii) enough volume materials for molecular testing; and iv) informed written consent from patients. Conversely, cases with no informed consent or less volume sample were excluded. Clinical characteristics of the 59 patients are presented in Table I. The mean patient age was 69.6 years and included 28 males and 31 females. All samples were fixed with 10% buffer formalin at room temperature (24-36 h) to create formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks at Department of Pathology in Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center. Hematoxylineosin staining was performed by the standard method using Tissue-Tek Prisma (Sakura Finetek Japan Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to DNA extraction, the tumor content of each sample was assessed using light microscopy at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 magnification, to ensure efficient PCR amplification. After sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100, 100, 85 and 70% ethanol), DNA from the tissue blocks was extracted using the QIAampTM DNA FFPE Tissue kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) and analyzed using a QIAcube Robot\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols (20).",

Several PCR based methods have previously been used as a routine test for the detection of EGFR status in United States, European Union, Japan and China, including the Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)\u00ae (22), such as Therascreen PCR assay. This method was approved by the FDA as a standard approach for EGFR gene analysis in lung cancer (fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/therascreenr-fgfr-rgq-pcr-kit-p180043); however, although stable and reliable, this approach has procedural complexities, including complex settings and controls for the temperature at several times using a thermal cycler. Alternatives, such as PCR-Invader\u00ae (23), peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid (PNA-LNA) PCR clamp (24) and Cycleave PCR\u2122 (25), have been developed in Japan and are commercially used in centralized laboratories.

To evaluate the sensitivity of these two assays, a genetic analysis was performed to investigate the minimum concentration of EGFR mutation detection in both methods. The minimum concentration for LAMP was 4.8% and there were no detection under 1.0% in the Therascreen assay. Therefore, the minimum concentration for the LAMP assay is ~50 times higher than 4.8% in the Therascreen assay. With almost equal efficiency, detection of the exon 19 mutation in Case X using the Therascreen method suggested that LAMP, as well as direct sequence methods, could identify false negatives. However, additional experiments investigating Case X tumor tissues demonstrated the presence of deletion mutations in exon 19. The direct sequence method has reported low sensitivity (31,32), whereas the Therascreen method was generally recognized as a promising method (11,12).
