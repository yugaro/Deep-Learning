When seen in patients with a normal heart, VF is generally triggered by closely coupled monomorphic PVCs, bradycardia, and hypokalemia.1 It is well accepted that myocardial ischemia is one of the most prevalent etiologies of polymorphic VT and VF. In this particular case, after a thorough evaluation of the causative factors, it appears that a combination of profound electrolyte disarrangements, ventricular ectopy, and mild myocarditis were responsible for the patient\u2019s clinical arrhythmias.

Especially in this case, against the backdrop of Fanconi syndrome and stage IV chronic kidney disease, the patient\u2019s profound hypokalemia was thought to be a major determinant of the recurrent arrhythmias. Despite the aggressive repletion of potassium in the setting of acute or chronic renal insufficiency, serial blood draws showed a downward trend in serum K+ levels, which made the arrhythmia resistant to treatment. Animal studies have demonstrated that hypokalemia-induced arrhythmogenicity stems from prolonged ventricular repolarization, slowed conduction, and abnormal pacemaker activity.4",

However, after placement of a temporary pacemaker, concomitant use of beta blockers is feasible, as was seen in our patient. Amiodarone may also be effective in suppressing and controlling malignant VT storm episodes.5 Ultimately, ECMO placement along with sedation and intubation, stellate ganglionic blockade, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, rapid ventricular pacing, and aggressive electrolyte replacement succeeded in decreasing the arrhythmia burden and attaining hemodynamic stability.",

The prolonged QT interval seemed to be a consequence of severe hypokalemia secondary to Fanconi syndrome; however, a congenital LQTS could not be fully excluded. It was deemed less likely, however, since congenital QT syndromes present infrequently as VT storm. This distinction is important since therapy of acquired LQTS differs from that of inherited LQTS. Specifically, using catecholamines, including isoproterenol, should be avoided in most inherited syndromes because of its proarrhythmic effect.1 Intravenous magnesium, overdrive pacing, and isoproterenol are recommended for acquired LQTS.",

The TRDN protein plays a role in muscle excitation-contraction coupling as part of the calcium release complex in association with the ryanodine receptor.9 Homozygous TRDN mutations have been reported in associated with autosomal recessive forms of long QT and CPVT, whereas from a renal perspective, TRDN mutations have been linked with IgA nephritis and renal failure.10 In CPVT, point mutations are responsible for the instability and future degradation of the protein.11 Since our patient was heterozygous for a previously unreported variant in TRDN, a primary genetic basis for her arrhythmias is extremely unlikely. However, we cannot exclude that the heterozygous carrier state may interact with specific conditioning circumstances and make an individual more susceptible to lethal arrhythmias in the appropriate setting.",

In non-Chagasic myocarditis patients, RCFA may be an effective intervention in VT storm; nonetheless, the long-term efficacy in this clinical setting remains unclear.13 For this particular patient, it appears that RCFA may not have been the most appropriate intervention, given the polymorphic nature of the ventricular arrhythmias, the lack of an obvious triggering PVC (multiple morphologies seen on ECG), and the relatively acute resolution of arrhythmias.14",
