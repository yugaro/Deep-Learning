Green, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) in DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin, and either [12C]Lys and [12C]Arg or [13C]Lys and [13C,15N]Arg for at least seven cell doublings. For the cells grown in [13C]Lys and [13C, 15N]Arg, heavy isotope incorporation was evaluated by running a pilot digestion of the heavy isotope [13C,15N]-labeled cell extract followed by LC-MSMS analysis. The heavy isotope-labeled amino acids were incorporated into more than 99% of the cellular protein. Cells were washed and incubated in DMEM (SILAC) containing 1% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin, and the appropriate (either [12C], [13C], or [13C /15N]) Lys and Arg for 15 h before treatment. Cells were treated with vehicle or GH (500 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were then washed with PBSV (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.5), harvested, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was frozen and stored at \u221280 C until use. Lysis buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) and 8 m urea containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN; Complete Mini, EDTA-free tablet) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm \u03b2-glycerophosphate)] was added, and the cells were lysed on ice by sonication [Fisher sonic dismembrator (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), model 100, three 30-sec bursts, power setting of 5 watts]. The protein content of the lysates was measured using the Bradford protein assay (37). Equal amounts of protein labeled with light isotope and heavy isotope were mixed, reduced, alkylated, and digested with TPCK-treated-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) at 37 C overnight.",

Peptides that did not bind to the immobilized \u03b1PY were further fractionated by SCX HPLC, and the fractions were enriched for Ser-/Thr-phosphopeptides using ZrO2 (25). The peptides that bound to and eluted from the immobilized \u03b1PY, the SCX fractions enriched for Ser-/Thr-phosphopeptides using ZrO2, and the peptides which did not bind to the ZrO2 were analyzed by LC-MSMS on a nano LC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA) interfaced with a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ)-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The Thermo-Fisher Orbitrap was used for this study because its high mass accuracy and resolution reduces the false positives for peptide identification. Peptides were separated using a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 15 cm column in-house packed with 3 \u03bcm C18 resin (Sepax HP-C18) over a 120-min gradient of 10\u201345% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Analytes were sprayed into the mass spectrometer via a chip-based nanoelectrospray source (Advion Triversa Nanomate) in positive ion mode. The LTQ-Orbitrap was operated in data-dependent mode by alternating single MS scans (300\u20131700 m/z) in the Orbitrap analyzer and sequential MSMS scans in the LTQ for the seven most intense ions from each MS survey scan. MS scans were acquired with the resolution (mass/peak width at half maximum) set at 60,000 at 400 m/z and an automatic gain control target of 1 \u00d7 106. MSMS scans were triggered on ions with signal intensity above 500. Recurring precursor ions were dynamically excluded for 30 sec. By applying charge-state monitoring, ions with 1+ or unassigned charge states were rejected to increase the fraction of ions producing useful fragmentation. The raw data files from LC-MSMS experiments were analyzed with MaxQuant software (version 1.0.13.13) (38) for peptide identification and quantification. Peak lists were generated from the raw data files using the Quant module in the MaxQuant program and searched by Mascot (39) against a concatenated target-decoy database of IPI-mouse version 3.63. Carbamylation (N terminus), oxidation (Met), and phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, Tyr) were searched as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation (Cys) was specified as a fixed modification. Search results were maintained by applying 1% false discovery rate for peptide, protein, and site identification. Phosphopeptide pairs that have a normalized SILAC ratio with a significance B less than 0.05 (P value calculated by MaxQuant) were considered to have a statistically significant change in the level of phosphorylation. B less than 0.05 corresponded to a GH-dependent increase of approximately 50% or decrease of about 20% (exact percentage depended on the trial, Supplemental Tables 3\u20135 published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://mend.endojournals.org).",

Light-labeled control cells grown in normal growth medium and heavy-labeled cells grown in medium containing [13C]Lys and [13C,15N]Arg were deprived of serum overnight, treated with (heavy-labeled) or without (light-labeled) GH for 5 or 15 min, and lysed. Equal (protein) amounts of cell lysates from GH-treated (+GH) and control (\u2212GH) cell samples were mixed and digested with trypsin. Because of the low abundance of Tyr phosphorylation compared with Ser/Thr phosphorylation and its importance in post-GH receptor signaling pathways, Tyr-phosphorylated tryptic peptides were isolated by immunoaffinity purification using phosphoTyr-specific antibodies. Peptides present in the flow through from the immunoaffinity purification were fractionated using strong cationic exchange (SCX) HPLC and then enriched for Ser and Thr phosphopeptides using a ZrO2 column. The enriched phosphopeptides from the immunoaffinity purification/SCX/ZrO2-based purification were analyzed by LC-MSMS. The collected MSMS data were searched against a concatenated target-decoy database of IPI mouse database (version 3.63) using Mascot and processed with MaxQuant (version 1.0.13.13) (38) (www.maxquant.org) for identification and quantification of peptides and proteins. We set the threshold for a significant change at a significance B less than 0.05 (P value provided by MaxQuant) (38). A false discovery rate of 1% was used for peptide and protein identification. B less than 0.05 corresponded to a GH-dependent increase of approximately 50% or decrease of about 20% (Supplemental Tables 3\u20135).",

In two subsequent experiments, 3T3-F442A cells were treated without or with GH for 5 min because we wanted to increase the probability that very rapidly phosphorylated phosphosites were detected. In these three trials, we identified 428, 721, and 1406 phosphorylation sites, respectively (Fig. 1B). The increase in the number of phosphosites identified in each successive trial reflects, at least in part, an increase in the amount of cell lysate analyzed. In the first trial, 1.2 mg/condition were analyzed, 2.2 mg/condition were analyzed in the second trial, whereas 3.0 mg/condition were analyzed in the third trial. Localization probabilities and posttranslational modification scores were calculated by MaxQuant software. Phosphorylation sites with localization probabilities above 0.75 and a posttranslational modification score difference (between highest scoring site and second highest) larger than 5.0 (46) were considered to be localized phosphorylation sites (i.e. the specific phosphorylated amino acid(s) within the peptide could be identified with high confidence). In phosphopeptides with unlocalized phosphorylation sites, there is some ambiguity in the exact amino acid(s) that is (are) phosphorylated. Of the 1790 phosphorylation sites, we confidently localized 294, 500, and 869 phosphorylated residues on 240, 394, and 769 phosphopeptides in the 15-min and two 5-min trials, respectively. When the results of the three screens were combined, a total of 230 unique GH-dependent phosphosites (localized and unlocalized) on 141 different proteins were observed; 132 sites exhibited statistically significant GH-dependent increases (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1) whereas the phosphorylation at 96 sites decreased by more than 30% (Supplemental Table 2). Ninety seven proteins had one GH-regulated phosphosite (68 increase, 29 decrease), 21 proteins had more than one site that showed increased phosphorylation, 17 had more than one site that showed decreased phosphorylation, and six had a combination of sites showing increased and decreased phosphorylation.",

The consistency of the phosphorylation ratios for the sites present in both 5-min trials validates the SILAC results and underscores the fact that the relative peptide levels encoded in the isotopically labeled samples are relatively unaffected by variability introduced during sample preparation (SCX-fractionation, phosphopeptide enrichment, and multiple desalting steps) that precedes the analysis by MS.",

In the 15-min GH screen, more than 55% of the phosphosites identified, 238 of a total of 428 sites, were observed in at least one of the two 5-min GH screenings (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Tables 1\u20135). Of the 24 phosphosites that were observed in more than one of the three screens and fulfilled our criteria for a GH-dependent increase in at least one screen, 19 also fulfilled the criteria (with generally quite similar increases) in a second screen, three showed slightly reduced increases that fell just below our cut-off criteria in the second screen, and only two (<10%) showed an increase in one screen but not another (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). These findings suggest that the variability of this approach lies primarily in the ability to detect a particular phosphopeptide in any particular screen, rather than in the ability of GH to up-regulate phosphorylation of that amino acid. They also suggest that detection of a GH-dependent increase in a phosphosite observed in any one of the three screens has a high probability of being valid, even when the phosphopeptide was not detected in the other two screens.",

GH presumably stimulates dephosphorylation of these target proteins by stimulating phosphatase activity or by inhibiting a constitutively active kinase. Increased phosphatase activity could be the result of a phosphatase being activated, e.g. by phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibition of a constitutively active kinase could occur as a consequence of a GH-dependent phosphorylation event. Alternatively, a protein could become more accessible to an already active phosphatase or less accessible to an already active kinase due to a GH-dependent change in subcellular localization or conformation. As one would predict for decreased phosphorylation, when a negatively regulated phosphopeptide was detected in both 5- and 15-min screens, the 15-min screen more often than not exhibited a more substantial decrease (Fig. 2). Of the 12 phosphosites that were observed in more than one of the three screens and fulfilled our criteria for a GH-dependent decrease in at least one screen, four were decreased after 15 min but not after 5 min, one fulfilled our criteria for a decrease in two separate screens, four showed a similar decrease in the second screen that fell just above our cut-off criteria, and three fulfilled the criteria in only one of the two 5-min screens. Thus, the data for the GH-dependent decreases in phosphorylation were not as reproducible as the data for phosphorylation increases. Because of the greater variability in and generally smaller magnitude of the GH-dependent decreases in phosphorylation and the unavailability of phosphospecific antibodies against the phosphosites with decreased phosphorylation, for subsequent analysis, we focused on the phosphosites that had GH-induced increases in phosphorylation.",

Four pathways contained five or more proteins that exhibited GH-dependent phosphorylation. The four pathways identified by KEGG have obvious functional overlaps and not surprisingly, several proteins are present in two or more pathways. The identification of previously unknown, GH-regulated proteins in two of the categories (\u201cregulation of the actin cytoskeleton,\u201d and \u201cfocal adhesions\u201d) highlights proteins that have the potential to broaden our understanding of the mechanistic basis underlying the ability of GH to promote changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility (52\u201356). In the category \u201cregulation of the actin cytoskeleton,\u201d the phosphosites in protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12a (Ppp1r12a)/Mypt1/myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, NHE1, and myosin heavy chain 9 were not previously known to be GH regulated. In the category \u201cfocal adhesion,\u201d the phosphosites in filamin, zyxin, parvin, and Ppp1r12a were not previously known to be GH regulated. The identification of proteins in the categories \u201cinsulin signaling pathway\u201d and \u201cmTOR signaling pathway\u201d that exhibit increased levels of phosphorylation in GH-treated cells are consistent with the known role of GH in the regulation of metabolism and cell growth (1, 2). Erk1, Erk2, and TSC2 were known previously to be phosphorylated in response to GH on the sites we identified. The phosphosites in raptor and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) were not previously known to be GH-regulated sites. Manual examination of the functions reported for proteins in our proteomic analysis revealed two additional proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway, each with two GH-up-regulated sites: PRAS40, which, like raptor, is part of the mTORC1 complex, and programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), which, like eIF4B, is a target of S6 kinase (Fig. 3). Thus, a total of 10 GH-dependent phosphosites in seven proteins lie within the mTOR signaling pathway. These newly identified GH-dependent phosphosites are all documented regulatory sites, i.e. sites whose phosphorylation in response to some stimulus has been reported to regulate the function of the protein (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1), suggesting that GH-promoted phosphorylation at these phosphosites regulates function and is physiologically relevant. The 15 proteins in these four KEGG categories include only a small fraction of the 95 GH-regulated proteins identified in our SILAC/MS-based phosphoproteomic study that exhibit GH-dependent increases in phosphorylation. Future analysis of these latter proteins, most of whose GH-dependent phosphosites have no known function, stands to further increase our understanding of the physiological actions of GH.",

After 5 min of GH treatment, 93 of the GH-stimulated phosphosites were in known consensus phosphorylation motifs. The majority of the 93 phosphosites were in consensus recognition sites for Akt/protein kinase A (PKA), PKA, casein kinase (CK)1, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamK)2, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), and CK2 (Fig. 4C). After 15 min of GH treatment, 24 of the GH-induced phosphorylation sites identified were in consensus phosphorylation motifs. For these sites, the most common consensus recognition motif was the WW Group IV (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that the kinases Akt, PKA, CK1, CamK2, GSK3, and CK2, and kinases that recognize the WW Group IV motif (or kinases with similar consensus recognition sites) are important components in GH signaling pathways. Akt/PKA sites were the most prevalent; 16 phosphopeptides that contained Akt/PKA sites were detected in our screens, which raises the possibility that GH activation of Akt (or kinases with similar consensus recognition sites) plays a greater role in GH signaling than previously recognized. Because only a relatively small fraction of the sites fell within the consensus substrate sequences of known (e.g. ERK, Akt) GH-regulated kinases, this analysis also suggests that much work remains in determining the pathways by which the remaining sites are phosphorylated in response to GH.",

            "text": "To gain insight into the reliability of the identification of the novel GH-dependent phosphosites, we performed immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Sites with available antibodies included three sites in proteins associated with the mTOR pathway (raptor Ser863, PRAS40 Ser184, and Thr247), one site identified in a protein in the insulin and focal adhesion categories (Shc Tyr423), and one site identified in a protein involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton (NHEI Ser707). Of these, PRAS40 Thr247 and NHE1 Ser707 fell into the category of Akt/PKA substrate sites. We also tested for phosphorylation at two additional Akt/PKA substrate consensus sites, NDRG1 Ser330 and ACLY Ser455. All of these sites were previously identified as phosphosites with regulatory function in the context of other stimuli. Within the mTOR pathway, phosphorylation of raptor on Ser863 by mTOR within mTORC1 or by Erks 1/2 promotes phosphorylation of raptor on other sites and augments mTORC1 activity (36, 57, 58). Phosphorylation of PRAS40 Thr247 by Akt facilitates efficient phosphorylation of Ser184 in PRAS40 by mTORC1 (59), which relieves PRAS40-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 (60). Shc recruitment to GH receptor/JAK2 complexes and its subsequent phosphorylation by JAK2 and recruitment of grb2 is thought to initiate GH activation of a Shc/grb2/SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway. Shc Tyr423 has been implicated as a grb2 binding site (61). NHE1 is a sodium/proton antiporter that catalyzes the exchange of Na+ and H+ down their concentration gradients. This exchange is important for control of intracellular pH, adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Phosphorylation of Ser707 of NHE1 has been reported to increase the antiporter activity of NHE1 (35). NDRG1 has been implicated in growth and differentiation and is necessary for p53-induced apoptosis (62\u201364). Phosphorylation of Ser330 (and Thr328) of NDRG1 primes NDRG1 for further phosphorylation by GSK3 (65) and is required for the suppressive effect of NDRG1 on the nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway (66). Finally, ACLY is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in many tissues. Phosphorylation of ACLY Ser455 by Akt has been shown to activate ACLY (67).",

We treated 3T3-F442A preadipocytes for 30 min with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that blocks GH activation of Akt (68) and then with GH for 15 or 30 min. The efficacy of wortmannin at inhibiting Akt activity was determined by blotting with antibody to Akt pSer473 or with a phosphospecific antibody to the S6 kinase 1 substrate Ser235/Ser236 in ribosomal S6. We observed robust GH-dependent phosphorylation of PRAS40 Thr247, ACLY Ser455 (Fig. 7A), and raptor Ser863 (Fig. 7B). Phosphorylation at all of these sites was suppressed by wortmannin treatment, indicating that GH-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40 Thr247, ACLY Ser455, and raptor Ser863 lies downstream of PI3K/Akt. Phosphorylation of raptor Ser863 is catalyzed by several kinases (Fig. 3), including Erks1/2 (36, 57, 58). Because GH is known to stimulate Erk activation (9), we also investigated whether the MEK inhibitor CL-1040 inhibits GH-dependent phosphorylation of raptor Ser863. The efficacy of CL-1040 to inhibit MEK substrates Erk1 and Erk2 was assessed by blotting with antibody against the doubly phosphorylated activated form of Erk1/2. GH-dependent stimulation of raptor phosphorylation at Ser863 was suppressed when MEK/Erk activity was inhibited (Fig. 7B), suggesting that GH activation of both PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 contributes to GH-induced phosphorylation of raptor Ser863. Taken together, these results provide strong support for the validity of the phosphoproteomics results and confirm a multifaceted role for the Akt pathway in GH signaling.",

            "text": "The current study is the first to use SILAC and quantitative MS-based phosphoproteomics to study GH signaling. To our knowledge, it is also the first study to use SILAC and quantitative MS-based phosphoproteomics to investigate ligand-dependent signaling via any member of the cytokine receptor family. This approach allowed us to identify and quantify GH-dependent changes in more than 200 protein phosphorylation sites. Among the seven GH-stimulated sites identified by phosphoproteomics that were the focus of the validation portion of our analysis, the GH response determined by phosphoproteomics varied from robust to subtle. However, immunoblotting confirmed all seven sites tested, even those with the most subtle increases, including four that were picked up in only one of the three screens, supporting our contention that for the GH up-regulated phosphosites, identification in even a single screen makes that site likely to be a bona fide GH-regulated site. Clearly, complete coverage of the phosphoproteome was not obtained in any of our screens, as indicated by the absence of known GH-dependent phosphosites (e.g. in Akt, GH receptor, JAK2, SH2B1, Raf1, MEK1/2) (13, 45, 69\u201372) and the fact that many of the phosphosites were identified in only one of our three screens. We did not expect complete coverage for multiple reasons. First, a certain amount of variability originates in the multistep preparation that precedes the analysis by MS. Second, ZrO2 selects for a particular subpopulation of phosphopeptides in the phosphoproteome. Studies using yeast revealed that different modes of enriching for phosphopeptides sample quite different subpopulations of the phosphoproteome with little overlap among them. Use of four different enrichment methods significantly increased the coverage of the phosphopeptide population (Kweon and Andrews, manuscript in preparation), suggesting that future studies would benefit from combining the results from multiple, complementary enrichment schemes. Third, in the modern LC-mass spectrometer, for each successive peak fraction selected by the nano LC system for analysis, two steps are performed: first, the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer obtains a single MS survey scan in the Orbitrap analyzer, then for the seven most intense precursor ions from each MS survey scan, sequential MSMS scans are obtained in the LTQ to determine their peptide sequence. Due to the highly complex samples obtained from the cell lysates and the limited sequencing speed at the MSMS sequencing step, modern mass spectrometers are only capable of sequencing approximately 16% of the precursor ions present (47). Thus, the relative abundance of a phosphopeptide greatly influences the probability that the ion derived from a particular phosphopeptide will be selected for MSMS sequencing. It is not surprising that in analytical replicates, and certainly with biological replicates, the ions from less abundant phosphopeptides might not be consistently selected due to slight changes in chromatography at either the SCX, ZrO2, or LC-MS steps (73\u201375). As evidence of variation in selecting different precursor ions for sequencing, in our study, the inclusion of a technical replicate increased the number of identified peptides by about 20% on average. Furthermore, for low-abundance precursor ions, the quality of the MSMS spectra deteriorates, thus making it more difficult to obtain protein sequence. The fraction of identified peptides following the MSMS sequencing step has been determined to be approximately 60% for abundant precursor ions, but drops to about 10% for low-abundance ions (47). In our typical screen, of the approximately 10,000 spectra we obtained, about 30% were identified. Fourth, the low expression levels of regulatory proteins and low stoichiometry of their phosphorylation further increases the difficulty of detecting phosphorylation events (76). It is well known that compared with many growth factors, stimulation of cells with GH does not produce a very robust signaling response. In 3T3-F442A cells, the signaling response to GH is much less than for platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor (77). Therefore, identifying GH-dependent phosphosites is likely to be particularly challenging. Finally, many phosphorylation sites are not identifiable either because the tryptic fragments are too large or too small for identification or because their sequence-specific properties lead to low efficiency ionization or fragmentation. However, based on the validation that we did with our immunoblotting studies, even those phosphopeptides that were detected in only one screen have a high likelihood of being valid and certainly provide sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of all the identified phosphosites.",

The change in phosphorylation observed by immunoblotting was consistent with our MS data, even when the MS data revealed only a 50% increase in signal with GH, providing strong validation of our phosphoproteomics approach. We identified phosphorylation sites in proteins previously reported to be phosphorylated in response to GH (Erk1, Erk2, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Shc) but the vast majority of the identified phosphosites (125 of the 132 GH-up-regulated sites) were in proteins not previously known to be regulated by GH. Based on the high degree of reproducibility (>90%) for GH regulation when a phosphosite was detected in more than one screen, and the high degree of validation (100%) of sites by Western blotting (including sites identified in only one screen), SILAC-based phosphoproteomics analysis is a very powerful method to detect novel GH-regulated proteins. In a single experiment, we detected 1 order of magnitude more candidate GH-regulated proteins than we have detected using other techniques (yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, immobilized phosphopeptide pull-down, Tap-tagged and Flag-tagged coimmunoprecipitation, and cloning of ligand targets assays involving JAK2 and/or GH receptor) and observed a much higher rate of verification of candidate proteins (i.e. the proportion of false positives was substantially lower). This is probably at least in part due to: 1) our SILAC-based phosphoproteomics analysis method not requiring overexpression of any proteins or artificial treatment or manipulation of any protein, other than growing some of the cells in heavy-labeled amino acids, and 2) the fact that the GH-treated and untreated cell lysates were processed together in a combined sample.",

The consensus substrate recognition sequence for Akt was one of the top motifs in our analysis of consensus phosphorylation motifs, and the Akt-regulated mTOR signaling pathway was one of the top four pathways in KEGG pathway analysis of our data. Given the shared roles of GH and mTORC1 in regulating protein synthesis as well as organ and body growth, it makes sense that GH activates Akt-regulated mTORC1 signaling. Before this work, only one GH-initiated pathway leading from Akt to the mTORC1 complex had been identified: phosphorylation of TSC2 Ser939 (14). Our phosphoproteomics analysis coupled with studies using wortmannin to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that GH stimulates the phosphorylation of numerous proteins in the Akt-mTORC1 pathway, including: 1) Akt-mediated TSC2 Ser939 phosphorylation, which suppresses TSC2 function and thus inhibits the activity of mTORC1 (49, 50); 2) Akt-mediated PRAS40 Thr247 phosphorylation, which is thought to contribute to relief of PRAS40-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 (59, 60); and 3) mTOR as well as Erk1/2-mediated raptor Ser863 phosphorylation, which has been shown to promote multisite raptor phosphorylation and augment mTORC1 activity (36, 57, 58).",

Because phosphorylation of Ser455 in ACLY has been shown to increase ACLY-dependent synthesis of acetyl-CoA (67), our finding that GH stimulates phosphorylation of ACLY Ser455 suggests that GH may increase acetyl-CoA synthesis. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, activation of ACLY would be consistent with the known rapid and transitory insulin-like stimulatory effects of GH on lipogenesis (78). Similarly, because phosphorylation of NHE1 at Ser707 has been shown to increase NHE1 activity (35), our finding that GH stimulates the phosphorylation of NHE1 Ser707 suggests that GH may activate the Na+/H+ exchange function of NHE1. Consistent with a multipronged regulation of proteins and pathways, GH may also increase NHE1 activity in a calmodulin-dependent manner. GH binds its receptor and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2. JAK2 activation has previously been reported to phosphorylate calmodulin, resulting in increased interaction of calmodulin with NHE1 and increased NHE1 activity (79). Although these proteins clearly merit and will receive more study, our SILAC and MS-based phosphoproteomic study reveals an additional 214 GH-dependent phosphosites (118 which undergo increased phosphorylation and 96 with decreased phosphorylation) in 133 proteins that have yet to be studied.",

This analysis suggests that pathways that activate these kinases or kinases with similar substrate specificity may play an important role in GH signaling. Of these kinases, Akt is the only one known to be stimulated by GH (13). Our present findings and previous work of others (14) provide evidence that a number of the identified Akt phosphorylation consensus sites are phosphorylated by Akt in response to GH (e.g. TSC2 Ser939, PRAS40 Thr247, ACLY Ser455). However, because of overlap within kinase substrate consensus sequences and because the MaxQuant analysis of consensus phosphorylation motifs does not use a comprehensive list of kinases, some of the identified \u201cconsensus\u201d phosphosites are likely to be phosphorylated primarily by a related kinase. For instance, GH signaling reportedly inhibits GSK3 (45). Thus, our finding that GH signaling increases phosphorylation of GSK3 consensus sites suggests that GSK3 does not represent the physiological kinase for these sites. Instead, another, perhaps related, kinase that responds positively to GH, seems more likely to be the responsible kinase. Akt is a member of the AGC family of kinases. Family members Akt and SGK1 are both reported to phosphorylate Ser and Thr that lie in RXRXXS/T motifs (83, 84). Rather than Akt/PKA, which was identified as the most likely kinase(s) by MaxQuant, the AGC kinase member SGK1 is thought to phosphorylate NDRG1 Thr328 and Ser330 (65). The AGC family member p90RSK (RXXS motif) is thought to be the kinase that phosphorylates NHE1 Ser707 (85).",

            "text": "At least one of the kinases identified in our motif analysis, CK2, is thought to be constitutively active (86). CK2 was recently reported to both associate with JAK2 and, in an in vitro assay, phosphorylate JAK2 (86). Additionally, CK2 inhibitors were found to depress GH-induced activation of STAT5, consistent with CK2 playing a role in GH signaling. With kinases like CK2 that are constitutively active, the regulation of ligand-dependent signaling likely requires a change in the conformation of protein substrates or altered subcellular localization of substrates or kinases to permit phosphorylation. Therefore, for potential substrates of CK2, it may be informative to determine whether any GH-dependent changes in subcellular localization of the substrates can be detected.",

Using this approach, we have identified 132 GH-up-regulated phosphosites in 95 proteins and 96 GH-down-regulated phosphosites in 46 proteins. Of the seven sites subjected to further testing by immunoblotting, all were confirmed to be phosphorylated in response to GH, which suggests that the phosphoproteomic screen identified GH-dependent phosphorylation sites with high accuracy. Motif analysis suggested that Akt, PKA, CamK2, GSK3, CK1, and CK2 (or kinases with similar substrate specificity) are important kinases in GH signaling. Manual annotation (Supplemental Table 1) and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the identified proteins included multiple adaptor proteins, focal adhesion proteins, proteins involved in the cytoskeleton, and proteins involved in transcription. Overall, these results provide multiple new candidates for study, some of which will extend our understanding of known GH-signaling pathways and functions, and others that have the potential to break new ground in our quest to understand the full range of GH responses.",
