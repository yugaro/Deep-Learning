For the prevention of airborne infections, many HCWs in hospitals have been fit tested for respirator use as a part of respiratory protection programs since 2003.[2,3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable.[3] Under these circumstances, the health consequences for individuals given denatonium benzoate become an important issue. We report a case that required hospitalization for a severe asthmatic reaction related to denatonium benzoate fit testing.",

A previous report[10] revealed a case with a severe allergic reaction, including urticaria and asthma, resulting from exposure to denatonium benzoate. Another study[3] in Canada presented several cases related to the use of denatonium benzoate for respirator fit testing. Among them, the reactions of several cases were likely due to an irritant effect; others were more consistent with angioedema and asthmatic episodes; and some of the adverse effects may have been more psychologic than toxicologic in nature. Individual susceptibility to denatonium benzoate may play a role in adverse reactions.[3,11]",
