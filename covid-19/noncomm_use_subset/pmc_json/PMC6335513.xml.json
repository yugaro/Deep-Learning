            "text": "\nStreptococcus equi subspecies equi is the causative agent of strangles, a highly contagious upper respiratory tract infection of horses. Typical clinical signs of disease include fever, inappetance, lethargy, submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy or purulent drainage, or purulent nasal discharge. Complications of S. equi infection can occur and include airway obstruction from lymphadenopathy, disseminated abscesses from hematogenous spread, or purpura hemorrhagica and various diseases caused by immune\u2010mediated processes.1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nStreptococcus equi M protein (SeM) antibody titers are typically measured to determine if a horse has developed a complication of strangles, such as purpura hemorrhagica or metastatic abscess formation, or to determine if a horse is at risk of purpura hemorrhagica if they were to be vaccinated. Both the 2005 and 2018 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statements on strangles state that a very high titer (\u22651:12 800) is associated with metastatic abscess formation or purpura hemorrhagica and that high titers (1:3200\u20101:6400) are detected 4\u201012 weeks after infection.1, 2 Anecdotally, horses can have high titers (\u22651:12 800) 4\u20108 weeks after infection and no signs of complications (authors' personal observations, KMD, LAB, ACT). The objective of this study was to measure SeM antibody titers on horses after outbreak to determine if titers detect the presence of complications.2 An additional objective was to follow SeM antibody titers out to 7 months after infection to determine immunoglobulin decay and to monitor for development of additional complications. We hypothesized that the magnitude of SeM antibody titer after infection (SeM titer \u22651:12 800) will be useful to monitor for the presence of complications or for the risk of development of complications.",

All samples were obtained with informed client consent. Approximately 8 weeks after initial diagnosis of infection with S. equi, serum was collected via jugular venipuncture on all 48 horses on the farm. S. equi M protein antibody titers were measured via ELISA for each horse at Equine Diagnostic Solutions LLC in Lexington, KY. At 12 weeks after initial diagnosis, serum was collected for repeat SeM antibody titers on select horses (n = 18). At 28 weeks after initial diagnosis, serum was once again collected for measurement of SeM antibody titers (n = 36).

Affected horses were categorized according to their clinical signs of disease into 4 categories: no disease, uncomplicated case, persistent GP infection, or complicated case. No disease was defined as no clinical evidence of S. equi infection. An uncomplicated case was defined as clinical signs of 1 or more of fever, inappetance, purulent nasal discharge, and submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy or drainage. A persistent GP infection was defined as GP infection (positive nasopharyngeal or GP lavage S. equi culture or PCR) lasting >40 days.4 A complicated case of strangles was defined as any sequelae or atypical case including signs of immune\u2010mediated purpura hemorrhagica, metastatic abscess formation (abscesses remote from lymph nodes of the head), secondary infections, or dysphagia. Horses with evidence of persistent GP infection and complications were categorized dually, but no horse with uncomplicated strangles had persistent GP infection.",

Fifteen horses were presumed to be initially infected with coronavirus based on these clinical signs.

S. equi M protein antibody titers do not correlate with a persistent GP infection.1, 8, 9 In our outbreak, 12 horses had persistent GP infection. At 8 weeks after infection, all of these horses (100%) had SeM antibody titers \u22651:6400 and 8 of 12 (67%) had SeM antibody titers \u22651:12 800. The high SeM antibody titers in these horses likely relate to continual exposure to the organism eliciting an immune response. At a SeM antibody titer \u22651:12 800, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting persistent GP infection were low (67% and 42%, respectively); however, when using the cutoff of \u22651:6400, the sensitivity was 100%, but the specificity was unacceptable (26%). A correlation applicable to other populations or outbreaks cannot be determined based on this outbreak, but an increased SeM antibody titer after outbreak could warrant additional diagnostics including testing for carrier status via nasopharyngeal or GP lavage.",

The causative S. equi organism was not sequenced for the M protein gene in this outbreak. The role of possible concurrent equine enteric coronavirus infections contributing to high complication rates in this outbreak is unknown. It could have resulted in delayed detection and quarantine specific for S. equi transmission, or it could have resulted in immunosuppression allowing more sequelae.",

One horse was being treated for metastatic abscess formation, and the titer was declining consistent with response to treatment. At 28 weeks after infection, all horses had SeM antibody titers <1:12 800. This is similar to a recent outbreak that reported 4.2% of horses having SeM antibody titers \u22651:12 800 after outbreak in which serologic testing was performed at 8 months after infection.12 High titers (1:3200 or 1:6400) persisted in 6 horses at 28 weeks after infection which would have been previously interpreted as consistent with 4\u201012 weeks after infection.2 Declining but persistently increased serum SeM\u2010specific IgGb titer levels were previously reported at 28 weeks after experimental infection.7\n",

Peak SeM antibody titers could not have been detected as SeM antibody titers peak at 5 weeks after experimental infection,7 and serologic testing and testing for carrier status was performed 8 weeks after initial infection in this report. Additionally a selection bias likely existed at the 12 week after infection time point at which the majority of horses rechecked had a previous titer of \u22651:6400. Lastly, 13 horses were not tested for carrier status and were presumed not to have persistent GP infection; however, this could have led to misclassification. At initial testing for carrier status, some horses were tested only once with nasopharyngeal lavage largely based on economics; however, the current recommendations for detection of carrier status are endoscopy and GP lavage.1, 4 This limitation could have led to underestimating the number of horses with persistent GP infection in this outbreak. It could have also led to overestimating the sensitivity and specificity of SeM antibody titers for detecting persistent GP infection as all of these horses had a SeM antibody titer \u22641:3200; however, this outbreak and other studies have indicated that SeM titers are not useful in this manner.1, 8, 9\n",
