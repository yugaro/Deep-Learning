It is also saprophytic and naturally resistant to antibiotics (beta-lactams, hydrophilic), and may become an opportunistic pathogen responsible for serious infections when favorable circumstances exist. Because it is environmentally present in soils, plants (including fruits and vegetables), aqueous habitats and humid environments [1], It has an ability to acquire resistance to antibiotics, and has multiplicity of virulence factors (diffusible or constituent) that baffle the host\u2019s defenses and allow the development of infections in susceptible patients, such as malnourished patients; burn victims, trauma patients, patients suffering from diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and blood disorders, patients undergoing mechanical ventilation or long-term corticosteroid therapy; patients in whom carrier surveyed peripheral and central catheters are being used [2]. P. aeruginosa infections are most often acquired in a hospital, but are sometimes community acquired; Factors limiting P. aeruginosa proliferation on the skin are dryness of the skin\u2019s surface and normal flora (Gram + Cocci). The bacterium P. aeruginosa can grow or become permanent on the skin in case of the traumatic rupture of the skin barrier; chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, extensive burns, diabetes include ulcers, oozing dermatitis, and wet or macerated lesions the disappearance of Gram + Cocci normal flora caused by the use of systemic or topical antimicrobials.",

Bacterial biofilms are structured masses of bacterial cells coated with a hydrated polymeric matrix of their own synthesis. The biofilm protects the bacteria and allows them to survive in hostile environmental conditions. The biofilm bacteria can withstand the immune response of the host and are much more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants than planktonic bacterial cells. The ability to form a biofilm is now recognized as a characteristic of many microorganisms [7-9]. The presence of biofilms during infections therefore requires new methods of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The existence of biofilms and antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the greatest threats to global health and, brings an additional level of complexity to the control of chronic ulcers. The \u201cblack beast\u201d of burn centers, Pseudomonas, is responsible for 10% of bloodstream infections and 28% of deaths. Therefore, alternative antimicrobial strategies are urgently needed, and this situation has led to a re-evaluation of the therapeutic use of ancient remedies, such as herbal extracts and herbal-based products.",

Tannins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They are common both in gymnosperms and angiosperms. Within angiosperms, tannins are more common in dicotyledons than they are in monocotyledons. Tannins can be found mainly in the cortex, roots, fruits and leaves. They have especially astringent properties. Tannins are mainly used externally, particularly to treat patients with injuries, wounds or hemorrhoids. Internally they are also used to treat patients with diarrhea and gastroenteritis. Tannins also exhibit antioxidant and antibacterial properties [13]. Catechin is a molecule of the flavonoid family; the name comes from the fact that this molecular compounds found in the fruits of Acacia catechu. Catechins are astringent juices from various sources and involve decoction of the fruit of Areca catechu L. (Palms), and the wood of the Acacia catechu. Catechins are present in significant quantities in green tea. The fermentation of the leaves being stopped soon after harvest, they are barely oxidized, which is the reason that green tea retains most of its original catechins , which gives them their slightly bitter and astringent taste. Green tea contains flavonoids 70% of which are catechins. Interesting amounts of catechins also exist in chocolate, red wine, apples and grapes. Five catechins molecules are: catechins, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate molecules. The latter is the most abundant and most active of all the catechins. According to numerous studies, catechins have, in addition to their antioxidant properties, a protective role in the prevention of certain chronic diseases such as diabetes and osteoporosis [14].",

Anti-bacterial activity was indicated by an inhibition zone surrounding the well (including the well diameter) containing the plant extract. The diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters and interpreted based on published standards [20]. Anti-bacterial activity was recorded if the zone of inhibition was greater than 8 mm. The interpretation of the anti-bacterial activity results was done according to the diameter of the zone of inhibition as follows: zones with diameters < 9 mm zone were considered inactive, zones with diameters from 9 to 12 mm were considered partially active, zones with diameters from 13 to 18 mm were considered active, and zones with diameters from > 18 mm were considered very active. The means and standard deviations of the diameters of the inhibition zones were calculated. The standard anti-bacterial agent was cloxacillin.",

Copper is considered one of the most effective nutrients for improving the wound healing rate. Many studies have documented its natural efficiency against germs and infections. Some studies shown that copper can destroy several bacterial strains; hence, it is interesting for use in dressings and bandages devices. Globally, copper strengthens bones, organs and connective tissues, and provides better overall immune response [24]. Prolonged supplementation may in turn affect the absorption of zinc, copper and iron. This is because copper, iron and zinc use the same routes to cross the intestinal barrier and reach the bloodstream.
