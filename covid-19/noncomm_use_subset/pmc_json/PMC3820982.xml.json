Recent research reveals that AIV subtype H7 shares some properties with subtype H5, including causing severe disease in birds4 and outbreaks involving large numbers of infected humans.1,5 Since March 30th, 2013, a reassortment avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus characterized by a unique combination of gene segments identified among previous AIV subtype H7N3 (ZJ12), H7N9 (KO14) and H9N2 (BJ16) viruses6 has caused a large number of human infections in China (33 infections, including 14 deaths in Shanghai). The sudden appearance of this disease with high case fatality and severe clinical manifestations has attracted substantial scientific and popular attention and has impacted human health and the economy. Given its wide and rapid spread within China, the newly defined influenza A virus H7N9 may possess pandemic potential. Efficient preparations should be made, but such efforts are complicated by the fact that the clinical traits regarding this new disease remain unclear.",

Two severe and six fatal cases involved \u22653 lung zones. Pleural effusion was observed in two severe and three fatal cases. The computed tomography values of the H7N9 real-time RT-PCR assay in upper respiratory tract exudates from mild, severe and dead patients were similar. Because the computed tomography values correlate with the viral loads in samples, the viral loads in the upper respiratory tract exudates of mild H7N9-infected patients were assumed not to be different from the severe H7N9-infected patients.

From our limited data, it appears that Ribavirin may help in mild cases and speed recovery because the inhibitor showed effectiveness during early treatment of H7N9-infected patients to some extent. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, Oseltamivir also has activity against influenza viruses. Because the antiviral resistance to Oseltamivir among circulating influenza viruses is currently low, this drug is prescribed to patients with influenza infections. In this study, in 85.7% (6/7) and 80.0% (8/10) of severe and fatal patient cases, respectively, the patient took Oseltamivir, as well as one patient in a mild patient case. The mild patient took Oseltamivir on day 3 following disease onset, while the six severe patients were given Oseltamivir on the sixth day. The eight fatal cases took Oseltamivir on the seventh day after disease onset. Out of the 10 patients who died, two were never given anti-viral medicine. Compared to the two patients who died that did not take Oseltamivir (5.5 days), the median disease spectrum of the eight fatal cases that received Oseltamivir was significantly longer (12.5 days).

            "text": "The clinical course and outcome of disease appears to be more favorable in children than adults when infected with highly pathogenic viruses, such as H5N1, novel H7N9 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Several possible reasons may account for this finding: parents take children to visit doctors when the children become sick or anti-viral drugs are more likely to be prescribed to sick children with a high fever. Another important factor for a severe clinical course of H7N9 infection may relate to impaired host immune function. Similar circumstances have been reported for measles infections. Research in measles found that remarkable lymphopenia occurred in measles cases, with a reduction in the number of T cells, B cells, neutrophils and monocytes. The severity of illness in patients parallels the severity and duration of lymphopenia,14 which is in turn age dependent, with less severe cases in young children but more severe cases in adults. The novel H7N9 virus may act in a similar manner as measles. More fatal cases (40%, 4/10) showed lower leukocyte counts than severe (14.3%, 1/7) or mild cases (0/0), and fatal cases also showed a higher neutrophil percentile (60%, 6/10) than severe (28.6%, 2/7) or mild cases (0/0). In addition, fatal cases (100%, 3/3) showed lower lymphocyte percentiles than severe (28.6%, 2/7) or mild cases (0/0). The lymphocyte subpopulation measurement of one child patient showed downregulated CD16+CD56+ natural killer cells. Attenuated natural killer functions were observed previously in H5N1 infected patients.15 Therefore, we propose that the novel H7N9 virus may induce transient immunosuppression that occasionally results in fatal opportunistic infections, especially in patients with underlying diseases. Our data are limited in the present study, and further research addressing host immune functions relating to H7N9 infection with a larger sample size may provide better answers.",
