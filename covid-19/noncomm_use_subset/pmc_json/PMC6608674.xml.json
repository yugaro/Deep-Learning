In past outbreaks, the death rates have varied from 45% to 90% (50% on average) [1]. The West Africa Ebola outbreak that began in March 2014 mainly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria [2]. By December 17, 2014, the total number of confirmed, possible, and suspected EVD cases was 18,603 worldwide, 6,915 of which were fatal [3]. From an epidemiological perspective, infected humans and primates were the major sources of infection. Humans were infected from contact through broken skin or mucous membranes with blood, secretions, excretions, organs, and other bodily fluids of infected animals. Soiled surfaces and materials (such as bedding items and clothes) can likewise cause infection [4]. The virus then spread through human-to-human transmission with an incubation period of 2\u201321 days (average: 8\u201310 days). Schieffelin et al. [5] observed an incubation period of 6\u201316 days. Most patients died of hemorrhage and multi-organ dysfunction within two weeks of infection. Laboratory tests found that patients developed a variable degree of multi-organ dysfunction, including liver and kidney damage [[5], [6], [7]]. As of December 2014, specific EVD treatment protocols have not been established [[8], [9], [10]]. As of the time of this study, Ebola virus vaccines have been the focus of research and development; however, none of them have been licensed.",

            "text": "Severe infection among medical staff characterized the March 2014 outbreak. Medical personnel were easily infected if they did not strictly follow the preventive protocol for infection control, and then came into close contact with suspected or confirmed EVD patients during diagnosis and treatment [5]. According to the World Health Organization, 605 medical personnel were infected in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Among these, 339 died, resulting in a mortality rate of 56% [11]. Koh et al. [12] found that Singaporean Chinese nurses felt themselves at high risk when handling cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza A H1N1. The nurses even believed that infections were unavoidable; however, they remained loyal to their duties. Bonnie and Barry retrospectively studied first-line central African nurses during the EVD outbreaks in 1995, 2000\u20132001, and 2003. The nurses\u2019 stress was found to be mainly due to the lack of protective gear and basic equipment, especially during the early phases of the outbreaks. The nurses were likewise stigmatized by their community, coworkers, and family [13]. A qualitative research reported that nurses caring for patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were considered to be \u201cgoing into a dangerous field,\u201d or as \u201cstrong pressure because of MERS-CoV\u201d [14]. Another study found that a significant percentage of workers encountered stressors due to isolation, alterations in home life, and discrimination. Physicians and nurses exhibited stressors that were primarily related to patient care [15].",

            "text": "On September 16, 2014, a Military Infectious Disease Hospital dispatched the first anti-Ebola medical team to Sierra Leone. Composed of physicians, nurses, staff on infection control, and staff providing general services, this team was the first Chinese delegation to West Africa and the mission lasted two months in Freetown. In the early stage (September 17\u201330), they completed material preparations and remodeled the originally comprehensive China-SL Friendship Hospital into an admission and observation center for severe infectious disease. The staff from SL underwent training, while workflows and protocols were created. In the middle stage (October 1\u201331), the team practiced and optimized the workflows and protocols, then admitted and treated patients with diagnosed or suspected EVD. In the final stage (November 1\u201315), patient admission and observation continued while the team prepared for homecoming and work turnover to the next Chinese team. On November 16, the first team returned to China and underwent 21 days of quarantine. This first team achieved the goal of zero infection among the medical staff from both China and Sierra Leone. Moreover, the admitted patients did not develop hospital-acquired infections, which established a satisfactory administrative and organizational basis for subsequent medical teams. However, the anti-Ebola medical nurses suffered deeply from stress. The present study aimed to understand the main stress sources, symptoms, and relievers for nurses of the first anti-Ebola medical team during their mission in Sierra Leone and their quarantine period back home. The findings can provide basis for future stress relief and counseling programs for the anti-Ebola medical team. Similarly, the study can provide basis for the organization, administration, and training of medical agencies.",

A few nurses did not directly care for patients, as four nurses worked on infection control and one nurse was responsible for rear services. A total of 10 nurses were selected as the study participants, all of whom were females and nurses-in-charge. Table 1 summarizes the general information about the interviewed participants. The qualitative sample size was determined by data saturation; that is, a participant was excluded when data redundancy occurred during the subject interview and nothing new was added during data analysis [18]. The brief interview with the other 5 nurses provided no new information, and thus, data saturation occurred after 10 study participants.",

Colaizzi's qualitative method is a rigorous and robust descriptive phenomenological approach, and therefore ensures the credibility and reliability of its results [20].

The situation in West Africa was complex with many uncertainties. In addition, hot weather and poor hygiene caused the widespread of various diseases, which was one of the factors that caused stress among the nurses.\u201cThe stress was highest before formally meeting patients as the training processes did not provide direct appreciation of the effects of Ebola. We were not sure whether or not the prevention and control measures were proper and effective. We were also concerned about other infectious diseases such as malaria and typhoid.\u201d (Nurse B)\u201cDuring the middle stage, we focused on proper protection to avoid infection. The first couple of days were used to adjust and we were all cautious. Later on, we found that we worked well with the nurses from Sierra Leone and protection measures were properly carried out. Additionally, many of us had experience in handling SARS and flu, and we trusted our team members. Therefore, stress was not significant after we started work.\u201d (Nurse C)\u201cDuring the later stage, the stress was not significant. It was close to the end and we were very excited.

Without previous guidelines, they needed to learn on site and become directly involved in these processes.\u201cThe stress was highest at the early stage. We started to unload supplies, perform on-site surveys, define working zones, and remodel the hospital. We had few clues about the work. Everything was subject to discussion and re-discussion, and the progress was slow. In addition, we couldn't properly understand what the SL personnel said, which made communication rather difficult.\u201d (Nurse A)\u201cThe beginning stage was the most stressful. As the nurse group leader, my stress mainly came from arranging jobs and training personnel from Sierra Leone. Workload and the organization of teams needed to be reasonable. Processes and measures needed to be fully thought out in detail. As the personnel from Sierra Leone had rather poor knowledge and skills, and were unfamiliar with some protective clothing, we needed to train them about protection and processes to ensure work safety for everyone and the smooth implementation of each plan.

Unsafety and unfamiliarity were the most significant sources of stress. Mishel suggested that feeling unsafe may occur during events or with diseases that cannot be precisely explained and categorized, but with predictable and undesirable outcomes [23]. During this anti-Ebola medical mission, an unsafe feeling may occur during diagnosis, treatment, prediction of transmission routes, and deciphering the disease infectivity. Under such circumstances, reliable and timely scientific evidence can help the medical staff to lower their feelings of unsafety, face the risks, and relieve unnecessary stress. This study suggests that full cooperation between the medical team and local hospital in both the front- and rear lines, safety training, and close communication with the worldwide disease control centers are necessary. The medical team members can obtain updates about the disease and ensure smooth information flow so that all involved can properly understand the risks.",
