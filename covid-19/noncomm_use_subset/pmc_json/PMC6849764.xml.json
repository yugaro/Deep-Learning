The genome of approximately 28 kb is protected by a capsid that is surrounded by a membrane (envelope) in which the surface glycoproteins (so\u2010called \u2018spike proteins') are anchored (Bridgen et al. 1993). PEDV\u2010diseased piglets shed high concentrations of infection\u2010competent PEDV particles in their faeces (Chen et al. 2014). As reported for other Coronaviridae this suggests that the surface structure of these PEDV particles stays intact in environments other than faeces (Hofmann and Wyler 1989; Lai et al. 2015). Rescue of infectious PEDV from several feed ingredients and additives was reported recently, showing that PEDV stays viable in other environments than faeces (Dee et al. 2014).",

It is mainly used in starter diets of weaned piglets, but also in milk replacers (Hansen et al. 1993). A multitude of studies showed that supplementation with SDPP reduces the period and severity of postweaning diarrhoea in piglets, indicating that SDPP may be a good alternative for growth\u2010promoting antibiotics in the pig industry (Pettigrew 2006; Ferreira et al. 2009). However, the introduction of PEDV in Canada in 2014, following the severe outbreak of PEDV in North America, starting in the spring of 2013, lead to suggestion that SDPP could be the cause of transmission of PEDV among pig herds (Chen et al. 2014; Pasick et al. 2014).",

Although there was no substantial evidence for the belief that PEDV was spread through plasma, the producers of SDPP commissioned a number of research projects to prove the virus\u2010safety of their product. In animal trials piglets were fed with diets supplemented with SDPP produced from plasma of pigs obtained from PEDV\u2010infected farms and produced from plasma that was deliberately contaminated (spiked) with infectious PEDV before spray drying (Gerber et al. 2014; Opriessnig et al. 2014; Schumacher et al. 2016).

Besides PEDV, also new and re\u2010emerging viruses pose a potential risk. To obtain a broader picture of virus inactivation in the different steps of production, inactivation of three other infectious viruses were measured in addition to PEDV; namely, the naked RNA virus porcine sapelovirus 1 (PSV1, alias porcine enterovirus serotype 8), the economically important naked DNA virus porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and adeno virus (AdV), a virus frequently used to monitor virus inactivation in feed and food products (Maunula et al. 2013). To reflect the industrial production of SDPP as much as possible (see for a production scheme Fig. 1) in this study raw porcine blood was collected at a regular slaughterhouse in the Netherlands, preprocessed to plasma in a similar manner as is done in industrial production of SDPP and spiked with a mixture of PEDV, AdV, PCV2 and PSV1. Portions of unconcentrated plasma (as is) were used to test the thermal and physical stability at neutral and alkali pH of these viruses during prestorage (Fig. 1) and after concentration by ultrafiltration, portions of concentrated plasma were used for spray drying using a laboratory apparatus (B\u00fcchi spray drying; see Fig. 1). Aliquots of the produced SDPP were stored at 11 and 20\u00b0C for up to 10 weeks (poststorage, Fig. 1). Samples collected were analysed by reverse transcription (RT)\u2010quantitative PCR (qPCR) to monitor the concentration of viral genomes and dilutions of these samples were subjected to virus isolation/titration using susceptible cell lines to determine the degree of inactivation of each step in the production process of SDPP.",

PCV2 strain 35 was isolated from pigs with PMWS in the Netherlands (isolation number 35; Wellenberg et al. 2000). AdV strain 2 was isolated from humans and is frequently used as internal control virus (index virus) to monitor virus inactivation in feed and food products (Maunula et al. 2013). To prepare virus stocks for spiking, nearly confluent monolayers of Vero (PEDV), A549 (AdV) or PK15 (PSV1 and PCV2) cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of about 0\u00b71 and grown for 5 days (PVC2) or until 75% of the cells showed cytopathogenic effect (CPE) induced by PEDV, AdV or PSV1. Virus\u2010infected cultures were freeze\u2010thawed twice at \u221270\u00b0C and the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris.

For each heat\u2010treatment of plasma, for spray drying, and for the stored samples of SDPP an LRF was calculated.

This loss of cells resulted in missing data points and partly unreliable results of titrations and demanded repeated re\u2010testing of plasma and SDPP samples. Therefore, the use of plates with 2 or 10 cm2 culture wells for titration and isolation of infectious virus for large numbers of samples was inefficient and laborious. Using Vero cells grown in 25 and 175 cm2 flasks, less cells detached. In addition, these larger cell surfaces allowed testing of larger quantities of plasma and SDPP, thereby improving the sensitivity of PEDV isolation. To determine the sensitivity of this virus isolation assay for plasma samples, a known amount of PEDV was spiked in preprocessed plasma of pH 7\u00b75 and in PEDV\u2010infection medium. Serial dilution of these spiked samples was subjected to virus isolation using 25 cm2 flasks. In this assay, the DF measured for spiked plasma was equal to that of spiked medium, and 100% of the spiked PEDV was recovered (Table 2). To test this for SDPP, duplicate portions of powders from B\u00fcchi run 1 and 2 (note that these powders were produced from spiked plasma (see Fig. 1) were dissolved in PEDV\u2010infection medium and one of the duplicates was re\u2010spiked with a known amount of PEDV stock and both were tested in dilutions in 25 cm2 flasks. At a DF of 12 500, typical PEDV CPE was observed and qPCR analysis detected PEDV replication for these re\u2010spiked powders dissolved in infection medium. Not re\u2010spiked powders scored negative for CPE and in the qPCR analysis at a DF of 12 500, and positive at a DF of 2500 (results not shown). This showed that an additional amount of infectious PEDV added to infection medium with SDPP was recovered efficiently and showed that components in SDPP did not inhibit PEDV infection in our virus isolation/titration test. Based on the concentration of PEDV detected in 25 cm2 flasks, at the measured DF, the sensitivity for detection of infectious PEDV in plasma or dissolved SDPP was calculated when larger quantities were subjected to virus isolation in 175 cm2 flasks. These results showed that spiked PEDV could be efficiently recovered from plasma and dissolved SDPP samples and an amount of 0\u00b775 PFU per ml plasma or 0\u00b773 PFU per g SDPP could be detected in this assay (Table 2). To obtain uniform data, testing of dilutions in fivefold steps, similar as was performed for PEDV, was also used for the three other viruses in this study (see Materials and Methods).",

In contrast to these studies, we were able to rescue infectious PEDV virus from SDPP produced in two independent B\u00fcchi runs at 80\u00b0C. Despite the pH of the concentrated plasma spray dried in these runs were different and our experiments were no true duplicates, repeated rescue of infectious PEDV irrefutable proved that the infectivity of PEDV is not completely inactivated by the physical and thermal conditions of spray drying that were tested in this study. It has to be noted that the residence time of plasma in a B\u00fcchi laboratory spray dryer is shorter than in an industrial spray dryer (ranging from 10 to 60 s), suggesting that a higher LRF than 1\u00b73 for PEDV may be achieved in industrial production of SDPP.",

Our results showed that conditions of thermal and pH\u2010dependent inactivation of infectious virus were different for the four viruses under study. Heating to 48\u00b0C was sufficient for effective reduction in AdV infectivity in plasma of pH 7\u00b75, but was insufficient for complete reduction in PEDV infectivity. In line with this, the heat of the spray dryer was, most likely, also responsible for effective reduction in AdV infectivity, whereas the residence time of plasma in the laboratory spray dryer was probably too short (0\u00b72\u20130\u00b735 s) (Kemp et al. 2016) to completely reduce infectivity of PEDV. In contrast, overnight incubation in alkaline condition at 3\u00b0C hardly affected AdV infectivity, but reduced PEDV infectivity efficiently. In a recent study, alkalization of plasma also potentiated inactivation of PEDV infectivity at 3\u00b0C and during heat treatment (Quist\u2010Rybachuk et al. 2015).",

In general, enveloped viruses (PEDV) are more heat\u2010labile than naked viruses (PSV1 and AdV). However, PEDV showed to be less heat\u2010labile than AdV in plasma. With respect to PSV1, infectivity was inactivated to an undetectable level in our tests immediately after spiking in chilled plasma of pH 7\u00b75. As observed for foot and mouth disease virus (like PSV1 also a picornavirus), addition of citrate (here used as anticoagulant) may have inactivated infectivity of PSV1 in plasma by chelating calcium (Hong et al. 2015). PEDV and PSV1 particles are secreted by cells of the intestinal mucosa and both stay infectious in the content of the intestines and in faeces, both rough environments containing a broad diversity of proteases and glucanases from the host and microbiota. The resistance of the PEDV surface structure to active components in plasma (e.g. chemicals, protease and other enzymes) or to added chemicals (e.g. citrate), in comparison to the damage imposed to the surface of PSV1 in this environment, indicates that for each family/taxa of viruses, or even for specific virus strains, inactivation of infectivity is dependent of specific (structural) features of these viruses.",

Only at the most extreme conditions applied (10 min incubation at pH 10\u00b72 and 48\u00b0C) some breakdown of PSV1 RNA was observed in plasma. A similar effect was observed for PEDV RNA in SDPP that was stored for 10 weeks at 20\u00b0C. For PEDV and PSV1 this suggests that their RNA genomes (note that RNA is more vulnerable to digestion/hydrolysis than DNA) were not readily accessible for degradation by enzymes present in plasma (proteases and RNases) or by alkali hydrolysis, indicating that the RNA genomes were protected by the viral envelop and/or capsid under all tested conditions. In a recent study na\u00efve pigs were fed for nearly a month with SDPP produced from blood of pigs seropositive for PEDV (Opriessnig et al. 2014). Although this SDPP contained a relative high concentration of PEDV RNA (5\u00b71 \u00b1 0\u00b71 log10 copies/g), it did not induce clinical signs of a PEDV\u2010infection, and also no seroconversion was observed. This also suggested that a considerable fraction of RNA genomes were protected from RNA degradation by RNases by the PEDV envelop and/or capsid. Failure of these PEDV particles to mediate infection of cells in the intestine of pigs suggests that the surface structure of these PEDV particles was damaged or altered. We observed that spray drying was more effective for inactivation of PEDV than prestorage at pH 7\u00b75 (at its natural state) at 3\u00b0C for 24 h (see Table 3). However, no conclusion can be drawn whether this damage/alterations to the surface of virions was imposed by the heat or mechanical shear in the spray drier. We used a plasma batch that scored negative in the (RT)\u2010qPCR test for PEDV and fully recovered spiked infectious PEDV from this plasma batch at ~pH 7\u00b75, indicating that no PEDV antibodies in our plasma batch inhibited the infection of Vero cells with PEDV. This in contrast to the study of Opriessnig et al. (2014), in which plasma derived from PCR\u2010positive pigs was used for production of SDPP in an industrial plant. This commercial SDPP contained IgG antibodies directed against PEDV, which could have contributed to the loss of infectivity of PEDV in this commercial batch.",

Partly, the growth of bacterial contaminations in PK15 cultures inoculated with plasma samples, interfered in our attempts to re\u2010isolate and quantify infectious PCV2. Also, it is known that isolation of infectious PCV2 from tissues and body fluids (including blood) is a difficult and time\u2010consuming process and is often unsuccessful for unknown reasons (Opriessnig et al. 2007). Given the high prevalence of PCV2 among pig herds in the Netherlands (Wellenberg et al. 2004), it is also likely that the raw blood collected in a regular slaughterhouse contains antibodies directed against PCV2 (Polo et al. 2013). The presence of these antibodies may also have hampered re\u2010isolation of infectious PCV2 from our plasma samples. Because of these uncertain factors, we found it unjustified to calculate LRF values for PCV2 in our inactivation experiments. Nevertheless, the results of our qPCR analysis were consistent with that of Pujols et al. (2008) and Shen et al. (2011). In these studies it was also demonstrated that the integrity of the DNA genomes of PCV2 was not affected by spray drying of plasma. In addition, we showed that heating of plasma to 48\u00b0C at pH 10\u00b72, the most extreme condition tested, did not affect the integrity of the PCV2 DNA. When used as ingredient in feed, the SDPP batches produced in the studies Pujols et al. (2008) and Shen et al.

            "text": "Recently PEDV was spiked in bovine plasma and spray dried using practically the same B\u00fcchi apparatus and temperature settings as in this study (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s 2014). However, they used sodium phosphate as anticoagulant instead of citrate, and mixed a PEDV virus stock with plasma in a 1 : 1 ratio instead of the 1 : 9 ratio we used. A ratio of 1 : 9 (or below 10%) is strongly recommended by the \u2018European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products' for studies validating inactivation and removal of viruses in production processes of human medicines (CPMP/BWP/268/95 report, 1996). Although they almost fully recovered infectious PEDV and PEDV RNA genomes from the 1 : 1 mixture of virus stock and plasma, they did not detect infectious PEDV in produced spray\u2010dried bovine plasma (SDBP), whereas we did in SDPP in two independent runs of spray drying with plasma of pH 7\u00b75 and 9\u00b78. In addition, in SDBP only a small fraction of the PEDV RNA present in the liquid mixture (Ct = 13) was recovered in SDBP (Ct = 23), whereas we fully recovered PEDV RNA after spray drying. The only plausible explanation we can think for these conflicting results is a difference in physical, chemical and biological conditions between the plasma mixtures used for spray drying. This may have imposed a different distribution of PEDV particles between the watery phase (e.g. aerosol particles) and solid phase in the spray dryer or affected the droplet size and moisture content of the produced SDBP powders (see below). The moisture content of the spiked SDPP we produced in the B\u00fcchi apparatus was 6\u20137% and comparable to industrial produced SDPP. It was reported that the infectivity of a human AdV vector in spray\u2010dried powders decreased more rapidly when the moisture content was higher (tested in a range of 2\u201320%; LeClair et al. 2016). Therefore, it is likely that the moisture in the SDPP batches we produced also favoured inactivation of PEDV during storage of SDPP at 11 and 20\u00b0C, probably by facilitating a higher level of protease and/or RNase activity in the SDPP matrix (Townsend and DeLuca 1990) or reactivity of chemicals. In line with this, we observed a faster inactivation of PEDV infectivity under conditions that chemicals, proteases and RNases from blood display more activity, that is more at 20\u00b0C than at 11\u00b0C. Also, a decline in the amount of PEDV RNA was detected after storage for 10 weeks at 20\u00b0C and pH 7\u00b75, but not at 11\u00b0C. This suggested that the PEDV RNA became accessible for degradation by RNases, implying that the protective shell (capsid and envelop) of the PEDV particles was (further) damaged during storage. This damage could have destroyed the capability of the PEDV particles to bind to a receptor on the surface of cells to mediate infection.",

In another study, PCR positive SDPP with an unknown origin of contamination induced clinical signs of PEDV when piglets were inoculated with SDPP using a gastric tube (Pasick et al. 2014), but not when SDPP was mixed in their feed. This latter study suggested that PEDV particles lose their capability to infect cells in the small intestine, most likely, due to the passage through the stomach, an environment with low pH and high concentrations of digestive enzymes. However, PEDV was rescued from various feed formulations (Dee et al. 2014) indicating that the surface of the PEDV particle endures the impact of various physical conditions and milieus. We demonstrated that infectivity of PEDV particles also endured specific physical conditions and different milieus, irrespective of the matrix in which these particles were enclosed, liquid plasma, or solid SDPP. The fact that a fraction of PEDV spiked in plasma stayed infectious after the heat imposed by spray drying gave us the opportunity to test the effect of storage on PEDV infectivity in a nonartificial manner. Storage proved to be an effective step to completely inactivate residual PEDV infectivity in SDPP. In combination with spray drying, a storage period of 2 or 4 weeks at 20 or 11\u00b0C, respectively, reduced infectivity of PEDV with an LRF of at least 4\u00b70. The calculated level of residual infectious PEDV present in the SDPP we produced from spiked plasma was approximately 4 PFU per g. When mixed in a 19 : 1 ratio starter diet\u2010SDPP, a ratio routinely applied, this would be \u22640\u00b72 PFU per g (\u22641 PFU/5 g). This is 280\u2010fold lower than the minimum dose of spiked PEDV (56 PFU per g) in feed that led to infection in 10\u2010day\u2010old pigs under experimental conditions (Schumacher et al. 2016). Based on a combined LRF of spray drying at pH 7\u00b75 and 2 weeks storage of 4\u00b70, it can be calculated that a plasma batch used for SDPP production must contain at least 6\u00b72 log10 infectious PEDV particles per ml to prepare a starter diet batch with a concentration of 56 PFU per g PEDV.",

Given a moisture content of 7\u00b74%, we calculated that for production of 1 g SDPP approximately 7 ml of plasma was used with a concentration of 4\u00b71 log10 PEDV genome copies per ml (Opriessnig et al. 2014), i.e. plasma with a 100\u2010fold lower concentration of PEDV particles that would be needed to produce a starter diet batch with a minimum infectious dose of 56 PFU per g PEDV (Schumacher et al. 2016). Assuming that this concentration of 4\u00b71 log10/ml is representative for the concentration of infectious PEDV particles in the blood of pigs with viraemia, the combined LRF of 4\u00b70 would be more than sufficient to formulate a 19 : 1 starter diet\u2010SDPP batch with lower dose than 56 PFU per g. To our knowledge, no data about titres of infectious PEDV in blood of viraemic pigs have been reported yet. Likely, this is due to the lack of a cell line supporting efficient infection of native PEDV. However, when data about PEDV titres in blood of viraemic pigs become available they can easily be integrated with the results of this inactivation study to validate PEDV safety of SDPP products in the future. We conclude that spray drying of plasma as is at an outlet temperature of 80\u00b0C in combination with a storage period at ambient temperature of 2 weeks or longer before dispatch, minimalizes the risk that AdV, PSV1 and PEDV particles stay infectious in the feed\u2010ingredient SDPP.",
