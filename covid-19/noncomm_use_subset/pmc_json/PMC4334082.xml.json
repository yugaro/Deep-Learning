A survey of 400 college students revealed that 46.7% of the sample did not engage in vigorous physical activity, and 16.7% were physically inactive (10). Based on research findings linking weight gain and reduced levels of physical activity to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, it is advisable for this population to learn about preventing or delaying the onset of this condition (11).",

Unfortunately, young adults may not be aware of the increased risk for type 2 diabetes that results from their lifestyle (e.g., unhealthy food and beverage choices and reduced levels of physical activity). Therefore, targeted diabetes education programs are needed to give these individuals an opportunity to learn about how they can modify their lifestyle while there is still time to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes at an early age. However, before attempting to tailor type 2 diabetes awareness programs for this population, it is necessary to identify their perception of their risks for developing diabetes.",

One survey was designed to determine college students\u2019 perception of their risk for developing diabetes in the next 10 years (15). The results showed that participants who identified themselves as being part of a racial or ethnic group other than non-Hispanic white and who had family members with diabetes perceived an absolute 10-year risk of diabetes onset (15). Another study found that participants rated their risk for diabetes onset lower than their risk for heart disease (16). A third study focusing on perceived susceptibility among college students found that 32% of a sample of 707 students perceived themselves to be susceptible to developing diabetes (17). It has been proposed that individuals must perceive that they are at high risk of developing a disease to consider modifying their health behaviors to prevent its onset (18).",

Convincing people to adopt prudent health behaviors may be more difficult if they believe they are either not susceptible to a disease or less susceptible than others (23). Individuals in general believe that they are less likely than other people to experience negative health outcomes (24). Raats and Sparks (25) found that there is a tendency for individuals to indicate that other people have a higher risk than themselves for experiencing a negative life event. This tendency shows an optimistic bias. Identifying such optimistic biases in personal risk perceptions is necessary because they may seriously hinder efforts to promote risk-reducing behaviors (23).",

This study also provides a reason to intervene to educate college-aged students who are not familiar with their own risk or with the contributing factors to risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Obesity plays a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes and other health conditions. The importance of changing modifiable lifestyle behaviors (e.g., adopting healthful eating patterns and increasing physical exercise) has been noted for prevention of diabetes and related diseases (27). Future research should focus on lifestyle-based risk factors in addition to risk perceptions and sex-specific influences in this population.",
