Tremendous quantities of sequence data, particularly the sequences of clinical specimens, are being generated daily by sequencing centres and individual laboratories. The prediction and annotation of genes is the first and most critical step in understanding the structure and function of genome components of viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. However, the development of tools that interpret sequence data still lags in pace of sequence data production.",

Craig Venter Institute, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, are sequencing various pathogenic genomes, including different viral genomes. Thousands of influenza genomes and hundreds of coronavirus genomes, rotavirus genomes and other viral genomes were sequenced by MSC. Viral genomes are relatively small (ranging from a few kb to 100 kb) compared with bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. However, the genome structure and gene features can be as complex as eukaryotic genomes. In addition to the normal splicing to generate mature messenger ribonucleicacid (mRNA) like the splicing in eukaryotic genome, a variety of complex gene features, such as alternative splicing, ribosomal slippage, ribonucleicacid (RNA) editing, stop codon leakage (stop codon read-through), ribosomal shunting (alternative translation initiation) and gene overlapping, can also be found in many viral genomes. A large number of viruses, such as rhinovirus and yellow fever virus, have only one open reading frame encoded in their small genomes. The single polyprotein of these viruses needs to be processed into mature peptides that will be incorporated into virus structure and be functional during virus replication. These complex gene features must be accurately defined in order to correctly understand these genomes.",

However, accurate detection of the complex gene features is a major hurdle for these universal gene prediction tools. Therefore, species-specific gene prediction programs have been developed to conduct the gene calling for specific viral genomes. For example, FLAN was developed at NCBI to annotate influenza viral genomes (2). In order to efficiently validate genome sequence data and accurately annotate the viral genomes sequenced by MSC, a homology-based viral gene prediction program called VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader, http://www.jcvi.org/vigor) was developed at J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) for influenza virus, coronavirus, SARS coronavirus, rhinovirus and rotavirus (3).",

For measles virus, hPIV-3, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (bPIV-3) and Sendai virus, the faithful transcript of the P gene will guide synthesis of the P protein; the edited mRNA, in which one or more non-templated G residues are inserted, will be translated into the V or D protein. To identify the RNA editing site, reference V or D protein sequence is aligned to the protein sequence deduced from genomic sequence to locate the frame-shifting region. In measles virus, Sendai virus, bPIV-3, hPIV-3, the sequence string AAAAAGGG immediately upstream the editing site is conserved and is screened to identify the RNA editing site (4,5). A single G residue is added into the complementary DNA sequence of measles virus at the editing site and the reading frame shifts from +1 to +2; in hPIV-3, bPIV-3 and Sendai virus, two G residues are inserted at the editing site. V protein sequence will be deduced from this edited mRNA sequence. In mumps virus, hPIV-2 and hPIV-4, the faithful transcript encodes V protein, and the edited mRNA, in which two non-templated G residues are added, encodes the P protein. The conserved nucleotide sequence string upstream the editing site is AAGAGGG (6\u20138).",

For the majority of mRNA, translation will terminate when the ribosome reaches the first stop codon (UGA). An Arg residue, however, will be incorporated into the protein product at the stop codon position (UGA) for a portion of mRNA (5\u201350%), and the translation will be aborted at the next stop codon downstream. The stop codon read-through site region is selected by aligning the deduced amino acid sequence to the reference protein in database, and confirmed by the identity (>60%) of the peptide sequences flanking the potential stop leakage site (100 residues on each side). The leakage site is finalized by the codon (UGA) and the conserved motif (Arg-Leu) next to the read-through site (9).",

The start codon of C protein gene is downstream the start codon of P protein gene, but the reading frame of C protein gene is different. VIGOR predicts the C protein coding sequence first.

The genome sizes of these viruses are \u223c11 kb and only a single long polyprotein is encoded in these genomes. This long polyprotein will be co- and post-translationally processed into 10 to 11 mature peptides by host signal peptidases and a virus-encoded serine protease. The three mature peptides (C, PrM/M and E) from the N-terminus of the polyprotein are structural proteins, and the other seven or eight mature peptides from the C-terminus are non-structural proteins. One hundred seventy complete genomes of both YFV and JEV were tested by VIGOR, a total of 170 polyprotein genes were predicted by VIGOR because only a single gene is encoded in each genome (13,14). The start and stop codons of these genes were in complete agreement with GenBank annotations (Table 1). The polyprotein of JEV is cleaved into 10 mature peptides (13). Eleven mature peptides are encoded in YFV genome (14). VIGOR was able to identify the mature peptide cleavage sites accurately and predicted 10 and 11 mature peptides in the genomes of these two viruses. Only a small number of genomes of these two viruses have their mature peptides annotated in GenBank. We compared the available limited data with VIGOR predictions.

VIGOR, therefore, categorized these four genes as pseudogenes. These genes were annotated as functional genes in GenBank. The start codons are the same as these predicted by VIGOR. The stop codons in GenBank of these genes are same as the internal stop codons detected by VIGOR. The other four cases, in which VIGOR gene predictions were not same as GenBank annotations, are the M2 ORF1 gene (M2-1). Two versions of M2-1 protein exist in GenBank protein database. The longer protein has five additional amino acids at the N-terminus. VIGOR always selects the longer protein to be the reference sequence. The upstream ATG was therefore selected as the start codon in these four genes. In the corresponding GenBank annotations, the downstream ATG were annotated as the start codons for these four genes.",

The C protein translation initiates from an alternative start codon with a different reading frame; the V protein is identical to the P protein at the N-terminal domain, but the C-terminal domain is different because of RNA editing, which results in one G residue insertion at the RNA editing site. In the mumps virus genome, one extra small hydrophobic protein is encoded between the fusion gene and the HN gene. The P gene encodes two proteins (P and V). Two non-templated G residues are inserted into the mature transcript that is going to be translated into the P protein, and the mRNA without editing encodes the V protein (6).",

The genomes of VEEV and alphavirus are \u223c11.5 kb, and the 5\u2019 two-thirds of RNA encodes two non-structural proteins, which are cleaved into three or four peptides required for RNA genome replication. The 3\u2019 one-third of the genomes encodes a structural protein that is cleaved into three mature peptides (C, E2 and E1) by proteases (9). In the first large gene of VEEV and some alphaviruses, a stop codon (UGA) is present downstream of the coding sequence of mature peptide nsP3. The translation stops at this UGA codon on most mRNA. However, for a small percentage of mRNA, translational read-through occurs at this stop codon, an arginine or another residue is incorporated at this position and the translation is extended to the next stop codon (9,19,20). A larger non-structural protein is synthesized because of the translational read-through and one additional mature peptide (nsP4) is translated. The mature peptide cleavage sites are identified based on the alignments between the polyprotein and the homologs in the mature peptide database. Once the junction region is located between two consecutive mature peptides, the conserved signature sequences next to the cleavage sites are used to identify the exact position of the cleavage. The conserved signature sequences were documented in literature (9).",

Like other members of the paramyxovirus family, the P gene is also polycistronic and encodes two to six different proteins. Sendai virus is the best studied virus in the paramyxovirus family. The P gene gives rise to a maximum of six different proteins by means of RNA editing, overlapping frames and ribosomal shunting (5,22,23,12). The V protein is produced from the edited mRNA. The faithful transcript encodes the P protein. Four additional proteins (C\u2019, C, Y1 and Y2) are also encoded in the polycistronic P gene by a process known as ribosomal shunting (12,23). Here, different start codons including a non-ATG codon (ACG or GCG for C\u2019 protein in the UTR region of the P gene) are used by ribosome to initiate translations. In the hPIV-1 genome, the P gene doesn\u2019t encode the edited mRNA that will be translated into V or D protein as is the case in other related viruses (24). However, the small proteins (C\u2019, C, Y1 and Y2) encoded by the alternative start codons are detected in hPIV-1 genomes. The P gene of hPIV-3 encodes at least four proteins (P, D, C and V) (25). P and C proteins are encoded by the non-edited mRNA with different frames. The D protein will be translated from this edited mRNA with the insertion of two non-templated Gs at the RNA editing site (25). The edited mRNA of bPIV-3 encodes the D protein with two non-templated G residues inserted at the RNA editing site. A C protein is also encoded in the P gene with a different reading frame (26). hPIV-2 and hPIV-4 are members of the rubulavirus genus. Like other members in the same genus, the P protein is encoded by the edited mRNA with the addition of two G residues at the editing site, while the faithfully transcribed mRNA encodes the V protein (8,27). The genome size of hPIV-4 is \u223c17.7 kb, 2 kb longer than other parainfluenza virus genomes.",

The start codons of 13 genes defined by VIGOR were different from GenBank annotations. All of these are M2-2 gene. Similar to the M2-1 protein in MPV, two versions of M2-2 protein exist in GenBank protein database. The longer version has two additional amino acids at the N-terminus. VIGOR picked the longer version as the reference sequence to define the start codon. VIGOR also predicted 33 genes that were not annotated in GenBank. All of these 33 new genes were the M2-2 and M1-2 genes.",

All the predictions have been examined by human annotators by comparing the predicted proteins with homologous proteins in GenBank. The evaluation data presented here indicated that VIGOR is not only able to accurately define the start and stop codons of genes in the designated viral genomes, but it can also precisely identify the complex gene features like RNA editing, stop codon read-through, alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation. Mature peptide prediction function has also been built into VIGOR for some viruses.",

Here, we demonstrate that VIGOR has been extended to accurately predict protein coding genes and identify the complex gene features for additional 12 different viruses. If reference protein sequences of a new virus are available and the genome structure and complex gene features of the new virus are well understood, virus species-specific modules can be developed to identify the complex gene features (if they exist) in the virus genomes. With the drop of sequencing cost and the increase of sequencing productivity, tremendous number of different virus species from both clinical and environmental samples will be sequenced. The accuracy and efficiency of gene prediction will be critical to interpret newly sequenced viral genomes and to understand these viruses. VIGOR can be extended to annotate the genomes of new viruses by incorporating new reference sequences into the protein database and developing the virus species-specific modules.",
