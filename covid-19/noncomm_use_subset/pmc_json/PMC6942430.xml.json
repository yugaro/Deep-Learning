After reviewing the relevant literature, we selected seven cytokines (CXCL\u20101, CCL2, CCL5, interleukin [IL]\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201017, and CXCL\u20105) that may promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 Transcription of these seven cytokines in the three macrophages (M\u03a6, MS, and MR) was assessed by RT\u2010PCR to identify the cytokines whose transcription levels were consistent with the trends from the CCK\u20108 and apoptotic flow cytometry assays. Only CCL2 was consistent with the previous results and the difference was statistically significant (Figure 2A). IL\u20106 also has the ability to promote endocrine resistance, and the transcription in MS and MR is different. However, our results showed that the transcription of IL\u20106 in M\u03a6 and MS was not statistically significant. Secretion of IL\u20106 could not explain the difference between M\u03a6 and MS in promoting drug resistance of endocrine tumors. Therefore, IL\u20106 was not chosen as the main object of the present study. To exclude the effect of autocrine CCL2 from cancer cells, we measured CCL2 expression levels in MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R cells by ELISA, and did not detect significant levels. We then determined the CCL2 concentration in CM from the three macrophages. With M2 polarization of macrophages, the concentration of secreted CCL2 increased significantly. Concentration of CCL2 was positively correlated with the trend of endocrine resistance in MCF7 cells (Figure 2B). Thus, we conclude that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance promoted by TAM. Two hormone receptor\u2010positive cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, were selected to test the effect of CCL2. We confirmed that CCR2, the receptor of CCL2, was expressed in both cell lines (Figure S1). CCL2 (100 nm/mL) was added to the two cell lines and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently, tamoxifen (5 \u03bcmol/L) was added to all four groups (MCF7, MCF7+CCL2, T47D, and T47D+CCL2) and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK\u20108 assay (Figure 2C,D). The four groups were also analyzed by flow cytometry to detect apoptosis (Figure 2E,F). We found that CCL2 promotes endocrine resistance and reduces apoptotic proportion in the two hormone receptor\u2010positive cell lines.",

As the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a classic pathway regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and endocrine resistance, we investigated the effect of CCL2 on the activation of this pathway. When MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L CCL2, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was significantly increased. Adding CM of MR to MCF7 cells also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. When MR was treated with 300 nmol/L Bindarit (a CCL2 synthesis inhibitor), the ability of the CM (MR + Bindarit) to increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR was weakened (Figure 2G). These results suggest that TAM promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells partly by secreting CCL2, which then activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",

However, there was no significant difference in TNF\u03b1 level between CM(MS) and CM(MR), nor between CM(MCF7\u2010S) and CM(MCF7\u2010R) (Figure 3A). Further analysis of the activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in M\u03a6, MS, and MR showed that activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in TAM was significant, but that activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway in MS and MR was not statistically significant (Figure 3B).

Results of the chemotaxis assay confirmed that the chemotaxis\u2010inducing effect of TAM toward THP\u20101 cells was stronger than that of macrophages, the chemotaxis\u2010inducing effect of MR was stronger than that of MS, and Bindarit the inhibitor of CCL2 reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of MR (Figure 4A). To further validate this phenomenon in vitro, we analyzed tissue samples from 100 patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry of serial pathological sections showed that a high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma was correlated with infiltration of CD163+ macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001) (Figure 4B and Table S2).

CM of MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R could activate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway of TAM. C, Western blot analysis of the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway. CM of MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R could activate the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway of TAM. Dephosphorylation of MR was more obvious than that of MS. Therefore, CM of MCF7\u2010R can promote activation of the mTORC1\u2010FOXK1 pathway more than MCF7\u2010S. *P < .05, **P < .01",

Bindarit reverses the enhanced chemotaxis ability of CM (MR).
