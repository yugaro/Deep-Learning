            "text": "Influenza C virus (ICV) is a ubiquitous pathogen of humans. Compared to influenza A and B viruses, it causes a mild respiratory illness or remains an asymptomatic infection. Most humans are seropositive to ICV by adolescence, and ICV is most commonly isolated from children less than 6 years of age (5, 6). Clinically, fever and respiratory symptoms are common and typically mild. Aside from humans, ICV has been isolated from pigs in China in 1981 and in the United States in 2011 (7, 8). Genetic analysis of the Chinese swine ICV found high similarities to contemporary human ICV, suggestive of interspecies transmission (9). In contrast, the ICV-like C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK) virus was only moderately related to previously characterized ICV, with approximately 50% overall homology. These results, in addition to a lack of cross-reactivity between antibodies against C/OK virus and human ICV in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, suggested that C/OK virus conservatively represents a new but distant subtype of ICV. Previously, only influenza A viruses were thought to possess multiple subtypes (10). Cocirculation of multiple influenza virus subtypes allows for antigenic shift, the process of rapid evolution mediated by reassortment of the genomic RNA segments of two parent viruses.",

Similarly, 9.5% of pigs had measurable titers in the HI assay to C/OK virus (8). Together, these results suggest that pigs are frequently infected by ICV. Despite its ability to infect ferrets, a surrogate for human influenza virus studies, only 1.3% of human sera had a measurable titer to C/OK virus. Additionally, the relatively low geometric mean titer (GMT) in swine sera in the HI assay to C/OK virus (20.7) led us to speculate that neither swine nor humans are the natural reservoir of C/OK virus.",

Detailed genetic, biological, and antigenic characterization suggests that C/OK viruses in cattle and swine are distinct from human ICV and likely represent a new genus in the Orthomyxoviridae family, with C/OK virus as the type species of influenza D virus. Additionally, widespread and high antibody titers to C/OK virus and relative ease of virus isolation in cattle indicate that bovines may represent the reservoir to this novel influenza virus. The finding of C/OK virus in both swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans.",

            "text": "To extend the understanding of swine C/OK virus genome expression, we used Illumina-based deep RNA sequencing to study viral transcription in swine testicle (ST) cells, focusing on examining and comparing the transcription and splicing of swine C/OK virus with those reported previously for human ICV. Total cellular RNA was isolated from ST cells infected with swine C/OK at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 at 0, 18, and 36 h after infection. Corresponding cDNA libraries were prepared and loaded onto an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) sequencer for sequencing. The DNA sequence data sets were then assembled against the C/OK genome, which has seven single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments. For each sample, we obtained on average over 9 million 100-nucleotide (nt) reads mapping to either C/OK virus or pig genomes. At 18 h postinfection, approximately 5% of the total reads mapped to the viral genomic segments, which was similar to that obtained at 36 h postinfection (data not shown). Read coverage for each of seven segments had significant overlap at both time points, demonstrating the active replication of the C/OK genome with a similar rate at both time points (Fig. 1). The pattern of read coverage clearly discriminated seven segments into three distinctive groups (Fig. 1). Group 1 included three viral polymerase genes (P3, PB1, and PB2 genes) that all had a large proportion of reads mapping to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of segments, with a significant reduction in the number of reads mapping to the internal regions. The overrepresentation of sequencing reads in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the segments suggested the presence of internal deletions in copies of these polymerase genes. The subgenomic segments with the internal deletions appeared to range in size from 300 to 700 nucleotides, which have been previously found to be associated with defective interfering RNA in replicating influenza viruses, including human ICV (13\u201316). Group 2, represented by NP and hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) segments, had sequencing reads relatively evenly distributed across the complete segment compared to group 1. Interestingly, a reduction of read coverage was noted in the 5\u2032-terminal half of the NP segment. The coverage reduction may indicate the presence of heterogeneous species of the NP genes with some sequences deleted within this region, which is similar to those observed for polymerase genes (PB1, PB2, and P3 genes). Group 3 (M and NS segments) displayed a large reduction in the number of reads mapping in certain regions of the segments, indicative of the presence of internal introns. Subsequent analysis of segment-derived sequencing reads identified potential splice junctions and introns present in both segments (Fig. 1; see Table S1 and S2 in the supplemental material).",

Further analysis showed that both splicing events utilized a consensus dinucleotide motif GT/AG: GT present at the extreme 5\u2032 (donor) with AG detected at the extreme 3\u2032 (acceptor) ends of the intron. The splicing pattern for the C/OK NS segment was similar to that of human influenza C virus (Fig. 2A) (17). In contrast, M segment splicing encoding mRNA for the M1 protein was different from that of the human ICV M1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Rather than introduction of a termination codon to the M1 open reading frame, splicing of the C/OK M segment added a second exon encoding a 4-residue peptide to the primary M1 transcript (M1 mRNA, nucleotides 29 to 756 joined to 1050 to 1062). Variability in the length of the second exon of M1 observed between the two viruses adds to the novelty of the C/OK virus. In addition to NS2 and M1 expressed through splicing, NS and M segments of both human ICV and C/OK viruses also encode NS1 and M2 proteins, respectively, through the corresponding unspliced mRNA transcripts. These viruses likely utilize a similar mechanism to produce these proteins, although further experimental validation is required.",

Virus isolation was attempted on PCR-positive samples using multiple cell lines, and viral replication was determined by rRT-PCR and hemagglutination (HA) assays. Virus was initially isolated from five different samples on human rectal tumor (HRT-18G) cells. The virus was noncytopathic but replicated to a high titer as determined by rRT-PCR (threshold cycle [CT] values of ~12 to 14) and hemagglutination assays (HA = 1,280 to 5,120 hemagglutinating units [HAU]/ml). Following the initial isolation, viruses were passaged on ST cells and displayed typical influenza virus cytopathic effects. Four of the isolated viruses all originated from the same herd in Minnesota. Two were randomly chosen for further study, C/bovine/Minnesota/628/2013 (C/628) and C/bovine/Minnesota/729/2013 (C/729), along with the remaining viral isolate from a bovine in Oklahoma, C/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (C/660).",

Antigenic differences between NP and M1 proteins detected in AGID or other similar assays allow division of influenza viruses into three genera (3, 20). AGID has been widely and routinely used to type influenza viruses, especially prior to the advent of RT-PCR and sequencing technologies. For the AGID experiment, similar amounts of split viral antigens (12 log2 HAU) were used with normal uninfected cell-derived mock antigens as negative controls. Antisera generated against representative IAV, IBV, and ICV recognized intragenus, not intergenus, virus antigens in the AGID (Table 2). No cross-reactivity between genera and no recognition of mock antigens were observed, indicating the specificity of the AGID. Significantly, polyclonal antibody against C/Tay virus did not recognize detergent-treated swine C/OK and bovine C/660 virus antigens but was reactive to C/JHB virus antigen, in addition to its own antigen. Conversely, both swine C/OK and bovine influenza C virus antigens, not human influenza C virus antigens (C/JHB and C/Taylor), were recognized by C/OK virus-specific polyclonal antibody. Considering that NP and M1 are major structural proteins of influenza virus, we concluded that the major differences of NP and M1 are responsible for the failure in cross-recognition of viral antigens between these two groups of viruses in the AGID. This result is similar to what we observed for reference influenza A, B, and C viruses in the AGID. As such, based on this finding together with results from in vitro reassortment and NGS analysis, we propose that C/OK virus may be considered a representative strain of a new genus in the Orthomyxoviridae family.",

Despite the presence of multiple cocirculating lineages, ICV are relatively genetically homogenous and thought to be near evolutionary equilibrium in humans (22). A recently isolated influenza C-like virus raised many questions about whether our understanding of ICV was correct. This virus, C/OK, was isolated from a pig in Oklahoma displaying influenza virus-like illness (8). Genetic analysis found only moderate (~53%) similarity to human influenza C viruses. Additionally, serological analysis found that antibodies against C/OK failed to recognize IAV, IBV, or human ICV. This virus also displayed phenotypes of broad cell tropism and had permissive growth at 37\u00b0C, which further distinguish this novel virus from human ICV. C/OK was provisionally identified as a subtype of ICV primarily due to its overall genetic organization (7 RNA segments) and both coding and noncoding region similarities to ICV. Despite these, the numerous incongruities observed with C/OK warranted further investigation.",

Infrequent isolation of C/OK virus from pigs plus a lower percentage of RT-PCR samples positive to C/OK virus (<0.1%) during the routine testing of nasal swabs from pigs challenged a theory that that swine is the primary host of C/OK virus. Based on these results, we suspected an alternate reservoir for this virus. Screening of a bovine serum panel representing animals from multiple states and production conditions (cow-calf and dairy) identified widespread, high antibody titers to C/OK viruses, suggesting that bovines may represent the reservoir to this virus. Serologically, the magnitude and percent positive for HI titers were similar to values reported for wild waterfowl, the established reservoir of IAV (23). Previous studies have shown that bovines are susceptible to IAV infection, and multiple subtypes of IAV have been isolated from cattle (24). Correlations have also been shown between IAV antibodies and respiratory disease and reduced milk yield (25, 26). Antibodies to IAV, IBV, and ICV have all been reported in cattle (27); however, the percentage of infected animals and titers were considerably lower than reported here for C/OK virus.",

As opposed to IAV and IBV, which use \u03b1-2,3- and \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acids on cell membrane proteins as receptors, ICV binds to 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as a receptor (28, 29). Another bovine pathogen, bovine respiratory coronavirus (BCV), encodes an evolutionarily related hemagglutinin esterase that also utilizes Neu5,9Ac2 as a receptor (30, 31). BCV can infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract and cause respiratory disease, implying that the receptors required for ICV are present in the bovine respiratory tract (31). Pathogenesis studies are required to evaluate whether C/OK virus utilizes Neu5,9Ac2 as a functional receptor and can replicate throughout the respiratory tract and establish whether C/OK virus causes disease in cattle.",

            "text": "The genome sequences of three bovine viruses were very similar to those of the recently described swine C/OK virus (8). Phylogenetic analysis showed that this clade of viruses was most closely related to human ICV; however, the distance between animal C/OK viruses and human ICV was similar to the differences between IAV and IBV for many segments. Additionally, there was no evidence of reassortment between human ICV and nonhuman C/OK virus. While our sample set was limited to three bovine viruses, we suspected that C/OK virus might be unable to reassort with human ICV. The abilities to reassort and yield viable progeny are necessary criteria for inclusion of a virus within a genus of influenza virus (4). An in vitro experiment was designed to determine if C/OK virus could generate viable reassortants with human ICV. Not unexpectedly, no reassortment between swine/bovine C/OK viruses and human ICV was observed despite the methodologies\u2019 success in detecting reassortment separately between human and nonhuman ICV. These results strongly suggest that C/OK viruses are unable to reassort with human ICV and by definition that C/OK viruses represent a new genus of influenza virus. Previous work found that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions of swine C/OK virus were similar to those of human ICV but did contain one difference (position 5 from the 3\u2032 terminus) and a polymorphism at position 1 from the 3\u2032 terminus (8). The conserved 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions for the three bovine viruses presented in this work were identical to those of C/OK. The noncoding regions are highly conserved within each influenza virus genus and form panhandle structures due to inverted complementarity, which is critical for genome replication and packaging (32\u201335). The inability of C/OK viruses to reassort with human ICV may be due to these minor differences in noncoding regions.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses exploit various splicing strategies to express their viral proteins to maximize the genome coding capacity. To date, splicing has been identified only in the two smallest segments, M and NS. It is generally believed that all influenza viruses possess a similar mechanism to generate spliced mRNA from the NS segment to code for the NS2 protein (17, 37). Different mechanisms for M segment splicing toward the production of M1 or M2 protein are reported in IAV and ICV, while the M segment of IBV is not spliced. IAV utilizes an alternative splicing mechanism to synthesize its M2 protein, while translation of M1 protein is made from an unspliced colinear mRNA (38). In contrast, the M1 protein of ICV is produced from a spliced mRNA, while its M2 protein is derived from a protein (p42) generated from an unspliced colinear mRNA followed by proteolytic cleavage by a signal peptidase at an internal signal sequence (2, 39, 40). Using deep RNA sequencing coupled with conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing for confirmation, alternatively spliced mRNA for both NS and M segments in C/OK-infected cells was identified. C/OK virus is similar to other influenza viruses in NS segment splicing to generate the NS2 protein. In contrast to the ICV M segment that produces the M1 protein through splicing that solely introduces a termination codon (consisting of nucleotides 752, 753, and 982) into a spliced mRNA, splicing of the C/OK M segment adds an additional 4-amino-acid peptide into the preceding exon. Variability in the length of the second exon of M1 adds to the novelty of this newly identified virus in swine and cattle.",

C/OK virus also encodes a novel mechanism for generating the M1 protein and, importantly, is unable to reassort with human ICV and generate viable progeny. In ecology, this new group of viruses differs from human ICV in that it resides in bovine. Furthermore, a serological survey suggested that C/OK virus frequently replicates and establishes its infection in bovines, with both percent positive and geometric mean titers considerably higher than those observed for humans and pigs, suggestive that bovines represent the reservoir of C/OK-like viruses.

For in vitro reassortment, all viruses were propagated at 33\u00b0C in ST cells and titrated to determine 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter (TCID50/ml). A single well of a 6-well plate with a monolayer of ST cells was coinfected with viruses as shown in Table 1 with an MOI of 0.1. Viruses were adsorbed for 1 h, and then the monolayer was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with DMEM. After 3 days, cell culture supernatants were serially diluted and plated onto a monolayer of ST cells with an agar overlay, and after an additional 1 to 3 days, individual plaques were picked and expanded on ST cells. Ten plaques were expanded for each reassortment experiment, and a single plaque was chosen from cultures of parental viruses.",
