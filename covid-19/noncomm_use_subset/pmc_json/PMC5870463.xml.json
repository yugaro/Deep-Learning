The International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) assigns a BSE disease status to member countries, and in 2016 categorised 46 countries as having a negligible BSE risk and 8 as having a controlled BSE risk.6",

Legislation banning the use of proteins derived from mammalian tissues for feeding ruminant animals was introduced at the EU level in June 1994. In 1996, enhanced controls on the production, sale or supply of mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM), as defined by the OIE,10 were introduced in Ireland11 and in the UK.12 At the EU level, legislation was introduced in January 2001 to enforce a total ban on the feeding of processed animal proteins to farmed animals. A total feed ban was implemented on May 1, 2004 in the 10 central and eastern European countries that joined the EU on that date (the \u2018newer\u2019 EU member states). Therefore, a total feed ban has been in place in Ireland since 2001, or since 2004 in all member states, but reinforced feed bans had previously been implemented in Ireland and the UK in 1996. Given this context, it has been challenging to determine the aetiology for those BSE cases born after the reinforced bans (BARB), and in particular the five classical BSE cases born between 2006 and 2011 (3 UK, 1 France, 1 Ireland).",

            "text": "The aetiology of BSE remains contentious. Early evidence suggested that BSE was caused by a single major strain, commonly referred to as classical BSE.13 More recently, two sporadic atypical forms of BSE have been identified (namely high-type (H-BSE) and low-type (L-BSE)), which differ from classical BSE.14 15 The unusually old age of all H-BSE and L-BSE cases, and their apparent low prevalence in the population, could suggest that these atypical BSE forms are arising spontaneously.16 However, there is no comprehensive information available on the aetiology and pathogenesis of atypical BSE in cattle. Serial passage of H-BSE in other species can lead to the emergence of a classical BSE phenotype, raising the possibility that classical BSE emerged from H-BSE.17\u201319 Such passage can also lead to the emergence of new strains of BSE,20 which underlines the lack of aetiological clarity for BSE and the challenges in determining controls suitable to deal with it. For BARB cases, it is suggested that the majority of cases have arisen due to continued exposure to contaminated feed.21 This view is also supported by a more recent UK study that hypothesises that the continued occurrence of classical BSE is due to an exogenous feedborne source, as a result of an over-reliance on imported feedstuffs into Great Britain and the later introduction of a ban on the use of mammalian MBM in other EU member states in January 2001.12 Milk replacer, containing extracted animal fats, has been implicated as a source of BSE for cattle in a number of countries.22\u201326",

In a review of the epidemiological features of cases of BSE born after July 31, 1996 in Great Britain, Wilesmith and others12 concluded that there was no evidence of a maternally associated risk factor. However, these authors also state that the nature of the risk of maternal transmission remains uncertain. In the same paper, the authors considered two means of environmental contamination to be possible: first, that in the early years of the epidemic in the UK, a proportion of clinically infected animals were buried; and secondly, the potential excretion of the BSE agent in faeces. Nonetheless, the authors concluded that there was no evidence that a substantial number of BARB cases in the UK occurred as a result of environmental contamination (other than from feedstuffs). Also, of significance regarding environmental contamination is spatial information regarding the location of the index farm in relation to previously infected premises or other local features of potential interest, for example, knackeries. Iatrogenic transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been demonstrated in human beings. This was linked to human growth hormone therapy,27 donated tissues,28 surgical instruments29 and blood.30 Iatrogenic transmission of scrapie through vaccines prepared from ovine material has also been documented.31 32 Posterior pituitary extract was used in veterinary practices at the start of the BSE epidemic in the UK, but no association between its use and the occurrence of BSE was found.2 A spontaneous origin has been proposed for a number of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), including atypical BSE as mentioned above, atypical scrapie33 34 and sporadic CJD.35 Because of the long interval between the implementation of the total feed bans and the time of occurrence of BSE cases in some EU member states such as Ireland, UK and France, consideration must also be given to the possibility that some cases of classical BSE occur due to spontaneous mutation of prions. As yet, however, this hypothesis is speculative and there is currently no supporting scientific evidence.",

Furthermore, the relevant data required to investigate BARB cases are sometimes unavailable, due to the passage of time, the loss of paper records and changes in farm management.11 Epidemiological studies of BSE have mainly been conducted using quantitative methods based on national data sets. Such studies seek to address a range of objectives, including an improved understanding of disease epidemiology11 36 and the spatiotemporal distribution of cases.37 38 There has been limited information on field-based epidemiological methods to investigate suspect cases of BSE, in contrast to other diseases such as foot and mouth disease where applied (field-based) epidemiological methods are available.39 This last concern has been further highlighted in a recent scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which recommended the creation of a predefined set of epidemiological data to be collected across the EU for the investigation of future BSE cattle suspects and new confirmed BSE cases.40 This approach would also be of potential value to countries with no previous BSE experience, when faced with a first or single case of BSE.",

As well as carrying out a thorough investigation of the feed supply chain for the index herd, the investigation team evaluated the potential for contaminated feed to have been supplied to the farm. In 2009 and 2010, few BSE cases were detected in Ireland (9 in 2009, 2 in 2010) compared with a high of 333 in 2002. Also, comprehensive control measures had been put in place in 2009 and 2010, including active and passive surveillance, removal and destruction of dead-on-farm animals, effective rendering systems, and controls with regard to the potential for cross-contamination at mills. Feed imported into Ireland was also subject to routine inspection and testing, which did not identify any bone spicules. These controls led to a substantial reduction in the likelihood of contaminated feed acting as a source of the BSE agent. However, because of the passage of time, it was not possible to be certain that we obtained complete information on all possible sources of contamination of feed for the index herd. It has been shown that an animal can be infected by a very low oral dose of the BSE prion, with the attack rate and incubation period dependent on the dose.46 47 Findings in the UK have highlighted the possibility of persistence of traces of contaminated feed in on-farm feed stores and the need for special care in the cleaning and maintenance of feed bins and silos and other feed storage facilities.36 Consequently, inadvertent exposure to the BSE agent in residues of old particles of feed cannot be definitively ruled out.",

The epidemiological framework and BSE investigation questionnaire overcome some of these challenges, in particular the use of methodology to facilitate data collection that is comprehensive and consistent. Further, the framework and questionnaire are underpinned by best available science. Nonetheless, several challenges remain that contribute to the difficulty in attributing cause to recent BSE cases. By its nature, a case study does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn on the source of disease. Further, the role of any specific putative source cannot be directly tested as no information is available on suitable controls. Finally, because of the passage of time between exposure and the development of clinical signs, there are inevitable information gaps that hamper attribution of the source of the BSE agent. Ireland\u2019s 2015 BSE case was identified through existing surveillance mechanisms, and the investigation provided evidence that all BSE controls are operating as intended. Based on the investigation, no definitive source of infection with the BSE agent was identified.",

We note that the main objective of the epidemiological framework is to hypothesise, or rule out, possible BSE sources on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. The framework provides an epidemiological logic to the assembly of evidence and allows the different steps of the investigation to be fully documented. The framework and associated questionnaire uses the best information available at the time of investigation of BSE cases. Given the rarity of BARB cases and uncertainty surrounding the source of infection for these cases, particularly as the interval between the implementation of the reinforced feed ban and the occurrence of new cases increases, it is essential that a comprehensive and thorough investigation of each new BARB case is carried out. It is hoped that the investigation procedure described here will be of benefit in that regard and that the information provided by the investigations will assist veterinary authorities in ensuring that the measures in place to eradicate BSE continue to be relevant, appropriate and fit for purpose.",
