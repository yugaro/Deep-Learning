Ubiquitin cleavage required 1,000-fold higher enzyme concentration (Fig. S1B). Kinetic analysis revealed deISGylase activity comparable with previously studied viral (18, 19) and human enzymes (20) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1C). However, a number of standard measurements for deISGylation activity were negative. ISG15-derived suicide probes that covalently modify ISG15-reactive Cys proteases (21, 22) were unable to modify Lbpro (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1D). Hydrolysis of ISG15 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) by deISGylases, such as the viral ovarian tumor (vOTU) domain of CCHFV, leads to fluorescence, yet Lbpro did not generate a fluorescent signal in this assay (Fig. S1 E and F). In contrast, slightly extended precursor forms of full-length proISG15 (amino acids 1\u2013165; featuring an additional eight residues at the C terminus) or proISG15CTD (amino acids 79\u2013165) were rapidly hydrolyzed by Lbpro (Fig. 1D). Strikingly, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of Lbpro-treated mature ISG15CTD (amino acids 79\u2013157) revealed a truncated ISG15 molecule; Lbpro had cleaved ISG15 between Arg155 and the C-terminal Gly156\u2013Gly157 sequence (Fig. 1 E and F).",

As mentioned, the WT ISG15 suicide probe modified several viral proteases but was too long to modify Lbpro (Fig. S2E). Removing the GlyGly motif from ISG15CTD and replacing Arg155 with a Gly-like C-terminal propargyl warhead (Fig. 2A) generated an ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe that efficiently modified Lbpro (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2E). This enabled purification, crystallization, and structure determination of a covalent Lbpro\u223cISG15CTD-\u0394C complex at 1.5-\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 2 C and D, Fig. S3, and Table S1). As anticipated, the ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe had covalently modified the catalytic Cys51 of Lbpro (Fig. S3). Individually, the Lbpro protease and ISG15 domains were similar to previously determined structures (18, 23) (C\u03b1 rmsds of 0.609 and 0.274 \u00c5, respectively).",

            "text": "The structure revealed how proteolytic cleavage of ISG15 is achieved (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3). Key interactions are formed via the ISG15 C terminus and also, via a hydrophobic surface centered on ISG15 Trp123 (Fig. S3). The positively charged residues of the ISG15 C terminus, Arg153 and Arg155 (the latter mutated to Gly in the ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe), are cradled by an acidic groove that consists of Asp49, Glu96, and Glu147 on Lbpro (Fig. S3G). Furthermore, ISG15 Leu154 occupies a hydrophobic pocket commonly found in papain-like enzymes. Mutation of either Leu154 or Arg155 to Ala in proISG15 strongly reduced cleavage by Lbpro (Fig. S3H). However, these C-terminal mutations do not prevent ISG15 binding, since the ISG15CTD-\u2206C suicide probe that lacks Arg155 was able to modify Lbpro (Fig. 2 B and C). The importance of the C terminus explains, at least in part, the observed weak cross-reactivity with ubiquitin and NEDD8, which feature identical or similar C-terminal sequences, respectively, and also, the inability of Lbpro to target other modifiers, such as SUMO1, which feature more divergent C-terminal sequences (24) (Fig. S3F). The observed interactions closely mimic those seen in the previously determined structure of Lbpro carrying out self-processing of its own C terminus (23) (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3F).",

Lbpro utilizes a corresponding hydrophobic ISG15 binding surface formed by Leu92, Pro99 in the \u03b13/\u03b14 loop, and residues, including Leu102 on the \u03b14 helix to shape the overall structure of the binding site (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C); mutations in these residues decrease Lbpro activity toward ISG15 (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4C). Importantly, this loop is not involved in interactions used during self-processing (Fig. 2E), and consequently and consistently, mutants in the ISG15 binding site are neither affected in their ability to self-process nor affected in their ability to cleave eIF4G (Fig. S5). Hence, substrate and ISG15 binding sites are spatially separated.",

Transfection of FLAG-tagged ISG15 and the ISG15 assembly machinery (UBE1L, UBE2L6, and HERC5) led to robust ISGylation in HeLa cells. Treatment of these cell lysates with Lbpro collapsed the ISGylated proteins, while free ISG15 remained seemingly unchanged (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6C). Serendipitously, we observed that ISG15 cross-reacted with a polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody (Fig. S6 A and B). Treatment with Lbpro specifically removed this cross-reaction, indicating that a fraction of the polyclonal antibody detects an epitope spanning the identical C terminus of both modifiers (Fig. S6 A and B). Antibody cross-reactivity provided us with a tool to monitor ISG15 cleavage by Lbpro in cell extracts. Indeed, when transfection cell lysates were probed with the polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody, the ISG15 cross-reactive band was no longer detected after Lbpro treatment, indicating that Lbpro had hydrolyzed the ISG15 C terminus (Fig. 4A, red box). The antiubiquitin blot also showed that ubiquitin modifications in Lbpro-treated samples were only partially processed, confirming ISG15 preference in complex samples (Fig. 4A). This was in stark contrast to the CCHFV vOTU domain, which cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 similarly (18, 19) and collapsed both types of signals to the same extent (Fig. 4A).",

We monitored Lbpro activity in a time course with anti-ISG15, antiubiquitin, and anti-GlyGly antibodies (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6D). With inactive Lbpro, ISG15 modifications were visibly increased 6\u20138 h postinfection, whereas no visible changes to total ubiquitin and no signal in the anti-GlyGly Western blot were apparent. In contrast, mengovirus with active Lbpro resulted in a decrease in ISG15 signals, a slight decrease in ubiquitin signals, and importantly, the appearance of GlyGly-modified proteins at 6 and especially, 8 h postinfection (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6D). This indicates that, indeed, production of active Lbpro by the virus leads to incomplete hydrolysis of ISG15 and ubiquitin from substrates, which can be visualized using available ubiquitin proteomics antibodies.",

In addition to previously known crucial activities during replication (4, 6), we now show how it also hinders antiviral signaling through removal of ISG15 and to a lesser extent, ubiquitin from proteins (Fig. 5). Importantly, its mechanism of incomplete cleavage irreversibly damages the modifiers, which can no longer be attached to proteins. This mechanism is conceptually similar to the activity of RavZ, a Legionella effector that hydrolyzes the C terminus of Atg8 ubiquitin-like modifiers involved in autophagy (30). Moreover, on the substrate side, Lbpro activity precludes remodification of Lys residues, and their small GlyGly modification(s) may not alter protein function significantly (Fig. 5). The slight cross-reactivity with ubiquitin is likely important, since ubiquitin modifications are much more abundant, and it is hence difficult to delineate the origin of the observed GlyGly signatures. Nonetheless, these multifaceted traits highlight the importance of Lbpro as a potent virulence factor (31). It is possible that other viruses and pathogens may use this elegant antiinflammatory strategy. While the leader proteases of other picornaviridae are highly divergent on the sequence level, the highly related apthovirus equine rhinitis A virus may also encode an enzyme that generates GlyGly epitopes, which could be tested using GlyGly epitope detection in infected samples.",

Our findings suggest that GlyGly-modified proteins could also be used in ELISAs to detect antibodies against this epitope. Detection of antibodies against GlyGly modifications signifies enzymatic activity of Lbpro that would only be observed after viral infection and hence, distinguish infected from vaccinated animals.
