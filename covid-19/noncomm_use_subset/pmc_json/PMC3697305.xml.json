Infectious diseases remain the second leading cause of death worldwide despite the recent rapid developments and advancements in modern medicine, science and biotechnology. Greater than 15 million (>25%) of an estimated 57 million deaths that occur throughout the world annually are directly caused by infectious diseases. Millions more deaths are due to the secondary effects of infections. Moreover, infectious diseases cause increased morbidity and a loss of work productivity as a result of compromised health and disability, accounting for approximately 30% of all disability-adjusted life years globally.1,2",

The diagnostic laboratory plays a central role in identifying the etiological agent causing an outbreak and provides timely, accurate information required to guide control measures. This is exemplified by the epidemic of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998/1999, which took more than six months to effectively control as a consequence of the misdiagnosis of the etiologic agent and the resulting implementation of incorrect control measures.15,16 However, there are occasions when control measures must be based on the epidemiological features of the outbreak and pattern of disease transmission, as not all pathogens are easily identifiable in the early stage of the outbreak (Figure 1). Establishing laboratory and epidemiological capacity at the country and regional levels, therefore, is critical to minimize the impact of future emerging infectious disease epidemics. Developing such public health capacity requires commitment on the part of all countries in the region. However, to develop and establish such an effective national public health capacity, especially the laboratory component to support infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and early response, a good understanding of the concepts of emerging infectious diseases and an integrated country and regional public health laboratory system in accordance with the nature and type of emerging pathogens, especially novel ones, are highly recommended.",

Thus, in this article, emerging infectious diseases are divided into four categories based on the nature and characteristics of pathogens or infectious agents causing the emerging infections; these categories are summarized in Table 1. The categorization is based on the patterns of infectious disease emergence and modes leading to the discovery of the causative novel pathogens. The factors or combinations of factors contributing to the emergence of these pathogens also vary within each category. Likewise, the strategic approaches and types of public health preparedness that need to be adopted, in particular with respect to the types of public health laboratories that need to be developed for optimal system performance, will also vary greatly with respect to each category of emerging infectious diseases. These four categories of emerging infectious diseases and the factors that contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases in each category are briefly described below.",

Subcategory 1a covers known pathogens that occur in new ecological niches/geographical areas. A few past examples belonging to this subcategory are the introduction and spread of West Nile virus in North America; chikungunya virus of the Central/East Africa genotype in Reunion Island, the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia; and dengue virus of different serotypes in the Pacific Islands and Central and South America.18,19,20,21,22,23 Factors that contributed to the occurrence of emerging infectious diseases in this subcategory include population growth; urbanization; environmental and anthropogenic driven ecological changes; increased volume and speed of international travel and commerce with rapid, massive movement of people, animals and commodities; and deterioration of public health infrastructure. Subcategory 1b includes known and unknown infectious agents that occur in new host \u2018niches'. Infectious microbes/agents placed under this subcategory are better known as \u2018opportunistic' pathogens that normally do not cause disease in immunocompetent human hosts but that can lead to serious diseases in immunocompromised individuals. The increased susceptibility of human hosts to infectious agents is largely due to the HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic, and to a lesser extent, due to immunosuppression resulting from cancer chemotherapy, anti-rejection treatments in transplant recipients, and drugs and monoclonal antibodies that are used to treat autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders. A notable example is the increased incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is caused by the polyomavirus \u2018JC' following the increased use of immunomodulatory therapies for anti-rejection regimens and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.24,25,26 Subcategory 1c includes known and unknown infectious agents causing infections associated with iatrogenic modalities. Some examples of emerging infections under this subcategory include therapeutic epidural injection of steroids that are contaminated with Exserhilum rostratum and infectious agents transmitted from donor to recipients through organ transplantation, such as rabies virus, West Nile virus, Dandenong virus or Acanthamoeba.27,28,29,30,31",

The proposed integrated system of public health laboratories is not entirely new; public health laboratories are already in existence in most countries, but most are poorly equipped and are not adequately funded or staffed with trained professional staff. Moreover, a lack of knowledge and coordination has led to ineffective operation in the support of infectious disease surveillance. The basic concept of realigning and harmonizing public health laboratories to optimize their roles and functions can be drawn from the system of medical practices. Due to rapid and vast expansion of medical knowledge, technology and demand of specialized skills and therapy, medical practices have evolved into a number of specialties and subspecialties, such as infectious disease, cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, radiology, anesthesiology and oncology. An excellent aspect of the medical system is the continual retention of the general physician (family physician) or general pediatrician as the initial or first entry point for patients seeking consultation for any medical problem before being subsequently referred to the appropriate specialist, if deemed necessary. It is not uncommon for patients, especially older individuals, to have more than one disease or pathology at the time of presentation to the doctor. In a similar manner, in outbreaks of infectious diseases, \u2018background' endemic pathogens are often present that are capable of similar disease manifestations. Thus, public health analytical diagnostic laboratories (both primary and clinical) should adopt a generic approach and serve as the initial or first entry point for the investigation of the causative pathogens in the event of an infectious disease outbreak or the occurrence of any fatal illness with clinical suspicion of infectious etiology.",

The public health research laboratories within the research institutes of ministries of health and universities or even private research institutions are best suited and can play a crucial role in collaborating with the national public health reference and diagnostic laboratories to discover novel pathogens of many human diseases under category 4, especially in subcategory 4b. The proposed network scheme will provide more cost-efficient laboratory services and ensure a regular flow of laboratory work to maintain the competency of technical staff to produce quality output. Because of the increased likelihood of epidemic diseases caused by novel pathogens, diagnostic laboratories serving as the primary entry point of investigation should be able to take a more generic approach in pathogen detection, isolation and identification. The traditional existing system of \u2018compartmentalization' of national disease/pathogen-specific diagnostic laboratories should thus be reviewed and integrated into the national public health infectious disease diagnostic laboratory system. This proposed model would improve cost-efficiency and allow a more appropriate approach to infectious disease outbreak investigation and control.",
