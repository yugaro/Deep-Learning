Obstinate hypoxemia and pulmonary edema in ARDS are caused by injury, shock, and other factors [2]. The pathological process of ARDS can be divided into 3 stages: the exudative stage (early stage), the proliferative stage (middle stage), and the fibrosis stage (late stage). At the exudative stage of ARDS, many cytokines and chemokines promote the pathological and physiological process of ARDS [3\u20135], showing that inflammation is closely related to the development of ARDS.",

            "text": "Chemokines, a group of the cytokines superfamily, have been divided into 4 conserved subfamilies (CXC, CX3C, CC, and C) based on the structural cysteine motifs adjacent to the NH2 terminus [6]. There is growing evidence that chemokines play an important role in tumorigenesis [7\u20139]. Cxc Chemokine Ligand 5 (CXCL5) presents a surprisingly elevated profile in bladder cancer cells, tissue, and urine of bladder cancer patients, and CXCL5 overexpression is critical for bladder cancer growth and progression [10]. CXCL5, by binding to its cell-surface receptor Cxc Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2), plays an oncogenic role in many human cancers. The serum protein expression of CXCL5 is significantly increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with that in healthy volunteers [11]. The expression of CXCL5 was significantly higher in lung cancer cell lines, and high CXCL5 was associated with high CXCR2 expression, which was significantly associated with poor differentiation [12]. CXCL5/CXCR2 performs its roles in angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor progression [13,14]. CXCL5 is an inflammatory chemokine, which is a member of the same family as CXCL10 [15]. CXCL10 can promote the development of inflammation in ARDS [16]. However, the role of CXCL5 in ARDS and its associated mechanisms are still unknown, as is whether it participates in the inflammatory process of ARDS by binding to its receptor CXCR2.",

In addition to their function in tumor progression, the CXC-chemokines were reported to be related to the development of ARDS, including CXCL8 [20], CXCL10 [21], and CXCL1 [22]. CXCL5 and the previously studied CXC-chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL1) all belong to the same family. A previous study showed that CXCL5 was involved in acute bacterial pneumonia [23]. We predicted that CXCL5 also functioned in ARDS. In the present study, we observed that the expression of CXCL5 was obviously increased in LPS-induced ARDS and gradually increased with disease progression. In addition, neutralization of CXCL5 can decrease the release of inflammatory factors, reduce pulmonary edema and pathological injury, thus alleviating LPS-induced ARDS.",
