This general framework permits simulating different epidemiological scenarios over the same network (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015), yielding disease-specific outcomes that could be important for informing management and intervention strategies (Rushmore et al., 2013, Yamin et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2014, Herrera et al., 2016). Although each scenario has its own characteristics and is expected to lead to specific outcomes, those are also constrained by network structure. Understanding to what extent such constraints can attenuate differences between different epidemiological scenarios may offer important insights into the ecology and dynamics of infectious disease spread (Keeling, 2005).",

In a typical implementation of epidemic models, nodes can be in one of three different states at any given time: susceptible to the infection, S; infected, I; and recovered/removed from the system, R (following complete immunization or death). Different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another. For example, a very common model is the SI, where nodes can pass only from S to I. In the SIS models, infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity (I \u2192 S) according to a certain probability, which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re-infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection. Simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network (I \u2192 R), which creates more complex models, such as the SIR and the SIRS (note that, besides immunization, the R status may indicate the death of a node) (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015).",

Of course, when similar networks are considered, as in the case of the field vole contact networks, epidemic parameters (and particularly transmission rate) became fundamental to determine epidemic magnitude. Nevertheless, even in the case of similarly structured networks, topological properties still permit an accurate assessment of relative network vulnerability towards a given class of pathogens (i.e. to pathogens whose spread can be modelled using similar epidemic parameters). These findings can help improve preparedness when limited epidemiological information is available and a fast response (for example in terms of prioritization) is needed, a situation that is expected to become ever more common in the future, due to the growing globalization, and the rapid emergence of new diseases.",

Due to the purely theoretical nature of this study, the choice of the Ri function is arbitrary. This formulation of Ri, however, permits a smooth transition from situations where the probability of recovery increases very slowly with time (when \u03c1 is close to 0), to opposite scenarios of fast recovery (when \u03c1 is close to 1). It is intuitive that the concept behind the SNES model allows for maximum flexibility in the choice of Ri(t) function, making it possible to accommodate specific situations. Yet, to avoid adding further complexity to our analyses (and possibly complicating the interpretation of results), we used the above formulation in all of our epidemic simulations.",

This accounts for a general property of immunizing diseases where individuals who have been infected and who have recovered are less likely to be re-infected, which is the basis of vaccination (though we note there is variation with respect to immunity which is unaccounted for in these models; e.g., waning immunity; Scherer and McLean, 2002). Interestingly, analogies can be drawn for very different contexts, such as that of information spread in social networks. The probability that a person will share a piece of information will rapidly decrease when receiving the same piece of information again. In the following, we will refer to this process as \u2018immunization\u2019, but it may also represent the path towards removal/death of an individual, corresponding to real world situations where repeated infections can be fatal. As in the case of Ri(t), Si(\u03b9) can also be adjusted to fit specific hypotheses.",

For example, the SNES framework makes it possible to track how epidemic outcomes compare between the SI scenario to a typical SIS scenario (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) by progressively increasing the probability that a host will recover and become susceptible again. Additionally, the SNES model can also be easily adapted to more specific scenarios. For example, the addition of a simple rule controlling the lapse between the time a node is infected and the time it becomes infectious enables the SNES to emulate compartment models that include latency (such as the SEIRS, which includes an \u2018exposed\u2019 class).",

In particular, while the different, typical compartmental models (and possibly a \u2018tunable\u2019 SIRS) focus on the possibility (and probability) of a host's transition from a health status to another, and use this constraint to identify different epidemic categories on the basis of permitted and forbidden transitions, the SNES attempts to remove the boundaries between different models.

To build networks using the configuration model (B\u00e9k\u00e9ssy et al., 1972), we selected a random exponent for the power law degree distribution varying between 2 and 3. In ER networks we set the number of nodes (V) to a random integer in [50, 500] and the number of edges to a random integer in [V, 1000]. In BA networks, we set the number of nodes to a random integer in [500, 1000], and the number of outgoing edges generated for each node to (V \u00d7 r \u00d7 0.01 + 1), with V being the number of nodes, and r being a random real number in [0, 1].

Thus, we generated all networks as directed and simple (that is without loops and reciprocal links), and then we added reciprocal links until reaching a preselected degree of reciprocity, extracted at random in [0, 1] (with 0 corresponding to a directed network with no reciprocal links, and 1 corresponding to an undirected network).",

Trapping sessions were carried out every 28 days from March to November, and every 56 days from November to March (please refer to Davis et al., 2015 for a more complete description of the methodology and additional details). Starting from the raw data, which included a unique identifier for each field vole individual caught in a trap at least once, as well as the time (day) and location (node in the trap-grid) of capture, we built networks of potential contacts between voles by linking all individuals caught in the same cage, or in two neighbouring cages (i.e. at a distance smaller than 5 m), on the same day. We then retained only the networks including at least 100 edges. In this way, we built 296 networks, with relatively small variability in their structural properties (much smaller than that observed in the set of simulated networks, see Fig. 2).",

(2011) for each network. Robustness is computed as: R\n=1/N\u2211r=1NQ, where N is the total number of network nodes and Q is the fraction of nodes in the largest connected cluster after removing r nodes. Although this measure was developed in a completely different context (in particular, to assess the resilience of a network against node removal), it is also closely related to the concept of percolation, which has fundamental implications for studying epidemics (Moore and Newman, 2000, Bogun\u00e1 et al., 2003, Serrano and Bogun\u00e1, 2006). In its original formulation, R was computed by removing nodes in decreasing order of their degree (i.e. their number of connections). The aim of sequentially removing nodes with the largest degree is to speed up the process of network disassembly, hence obtaining a conservative estimate of robustness in the worst case scenario of node removal. However, it has been pointed out that other criteria going beyond local properties (such as node degree) could offer more efficient ways to disrupt networks (Morone and Makse, 2015). Thus, we used PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to determine the order of node removal in the computation of R. Nevertheless, we also tested the sensitivity of R as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability (see section 2.10) to different criteria of node removal (namely, node degree and betweenness).",

In simulated networks, the magnitude of epidemic outbreaks (Fig. 3) was well explained by the combination of epidemic parameters and by network properties (Table 1). Surprisingly, topological properties, and particularly the density of infection pathways (quantified by network connectance), and their redundancy (quantified by network clustering, that is how often two nodes pointing to another one are linked, and by network robustness, see below) had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered (Fig. 4). Network robustness (R) resulted also more important than epidemic parameters (and the second most important factor). This result was very consistent in two different scenarios where we assumed, respectively, that all nodes had the same susceptibility to infection (0.5), or a random susceptibility extracted from a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.1. This suggests that outbreak magnitude is driven by average susceptibility more than by its variation across individuals.

Transmission rate (\u03c4) emerged as the most important factor, although both network robustness and network connectance had very strong effects (much higher than those of \u03c1 and \u03b9).

In particular, the rank of field vole networks according to R was very consistent with the rank obtained by ordering networks on the basis of their vulnerability in a broad range of epidemic scenarios, that we modeled by running a set of classical SIR models (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) under different combinations of infection/recovery probabilities (Fig. 6; adjusted R-squared: 0.59, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.77x + 0.12). We quantified vulnerability in terms of the total fraction of nodes reached by the infection throughout the epidemic simulation (see Fig. 3-II). This result is particularly convincing when considering the limited topological variability of the field vole contact networks (see Fig. 2), which makes them a challenging benchmark to test the sensitivity of R as a vulnerability measure. Using different criteria of node removal to compute R (namely, node degree and betweenness) led to very consistent results (adjusted R-squared: 0.60, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node degree was used; adjusted R-squared: 0.61, p < 0.00001, regression line y = 0.78x + 0.11 when node betweenness was used).",

For example, one will use a network of sexual contacts to model the spread of HIV within a community (Woodhouse et al., 1994), or a spatial network mapping crop distribution to model a plant pest spread (Strona et al., 2017), or again the air transportation network for describing airborne pathogens (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013). On the one hand, in such cases, looking at the pathogen and at the network as two separate entities would not be straightforward. On the other hand, however, the issue is more philosophical rather than applicative, since it does not prevent us from comparing network vulnerability both between and within broad classes of pathogen transmission strategies. Furthermore, it depicts more scenarios where our findings could be very useful. For example, one may generate different networks within the same context by considering different possible pathogen transmission strategies. Those could be either general ones, such as airborne or sexual transmission, or very specific strategies taking into account, for instance, vector vagility (Strona et al., 2017). Then, one may compare the structure of such networks in order to identify their relative risk towards different kinds of pathogens.",

For example, the properties of the air-transportation-network have been identified as a main determinant of global patterns of emerging diseases, with complex features of the airline network being at heart of the global spread dynamics of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Colizza et al., 2006). In addition, a more recent study showed that measuring the distance between the source and the target of an infection in network space can provide a more reliable prediction of epidemic spread rate than geographical distance, regardless of the nature of the disease (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013). Consistent with those ideas, our findings suggest that, in the face of many unmeasurable unknowns related to epidemiological parameters, focusing on network properties can facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities and the optimization of existing systems.",
