Although the clinical features of adenovirus-positive KD are similar to an isolated adenoviral infection, adenoviral-positive KD usually had frequent lip and tongue change, skin rash and changes in extremities compared to adenoviral infection. However, cervical lymphadenopathy was not differently observed between the 2 groups. In the present study, CRP, hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria could be differentiated between the adenovirus-positive KD group and adenoviral infection group. In addition, the cutoff CRP level of 56 mg/L aids in the discrimination of diagnosis of KD from adenoviral infection. This distinct clinical and laboratory pattern was characteristic of adenovirus positive KD. However, high CRP level could also be observed in adenoviral infection with secondary bacterial infection. Although the American Heart Association guidelines suggest that a CRP \u226530 mg/L or ESR \u226540 mm/hr may consider incomplete KD15), a recent study demonstrated that a CRP \u226530 mg/L has a lack specificity for KD. Additionally, a higher CRP \u226570 mg/L suggesting the discrimination of KD from adenoviral infection was consistently observed in the KD group14).",
