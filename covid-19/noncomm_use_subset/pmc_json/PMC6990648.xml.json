            "text": "Membrane fusion\u2014the merging of two lipid bilayers into one\u2014involves substantial membrane remodeling and lipid rearrangements, imposing a high energy barrier that must be overcome by specialized membrane fusion proteins (Kozlov et al., 2010; Martens and McMahon, 2008; S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009). An extensively studied form of membrane fusion is the merging of intracellular vesicles with their target membranes, which transports cargo proteins between organelles in the endomembrane system (Baker and Hughson, 2016; Brunger et al., 2009; Ohya et al., 2009; Wickner, 2010). Intracellular vesicle fusion is driven by two conserved families of molecules: SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and SM (Sec1/Munc18) proteins (Rizo and S\u00fcdhof, 2012; Shen et al., 2007). The vesicle-anchored v-SNARE pairs with the target membrane-associated t-SNAREs to form a four-helix trans-SNARE complex, forcing the two membranes into close apposition to fuse (Kr\u00e4mer and Ungermann, 2011; Schwartz and Merz, 2009; S\u00f6llner et al., 1993). A cognate SM protein activates SNARE zippering and ensures SNARE pairing specificity (Baker et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Theoretical modeling suggests that, to overcome the energy barrier of membrane fusion, the lipid bilayer structure must be disrupted after the two membranes are brought into close proximity (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008; Kozlov et al., 2010; Risselada and Grubm\u00fcller, 2012). In viral fusion, another type of extensively studied membrane fusion, viral fusion proteins possess membrane-destabilizing peptides required for the fusion of enveloped viruses with host cell membranes (Earp et al., 2005; Harrison, 2008). Virus-anchored fusion proteins bring the viral limiting membrane and the host cell membrane (the plasma membrane or the endosome) into close apposition as they refold between the membrane bilayers, analogous to the role of the trans-SNARE complex in intracellular vesicle fusion (Chlanda et al., 2016; Harrison, 2008; Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007; Martens and McMahon, 2008; Top et al., 2005). Viral fusion proteins use fusion peptides to anchor the virus to the host cell (Harrison, 2008). Interestingly, in addition to their membrane-anchoring function, fusion peptides can directly destabilize lipid bilayers to promote viral membrane fusion (D\u00fczg\u00fcne\u015f and Shavnin, 1992; Earp et al., 2005; Epand, 2003; Haldar et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2004; Shmulevitz et al., 2004). Besides fusion peptides, the membrane-proximal external regions of viral fusion proteins can also destabilize membrane bilayers (Allison et al., 1999; Buzon et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2008; Jeetendra et al., 2003; Mu\u00f1oz-Barroso et al., 1999; Vishwanathan and Hunter, 2008). More recently, membrane-destabilizing peptides were also discovered in non-viral fusion proteins such as atlastins, which drive homotypic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fusion (Faust et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012).",

In this work, we discovered that the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE directly perturbs the lipid bilayer structure in a manner reminiscent of viral fusion proteins. Mutations of the juxtamembrane motif abrogate SNARE-SM-mediated fusion in vitro, correlating with the essential role of the juxtamembrane motif in vesicle fusion in the cell. Importantly, the juxtamembrane motif can be functionally replaced by an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in membrane fusion. Thus, intracellular vesicle fusion also requires a membrane-destabilizing peptide, supporting the notion that membrane-destabilizing peptides constitute a universal element in membrane fusion reactions. These findings suggest that biological membrane fusion pathways, although driven by disparate fusion proteins, are governed by common underlying mechanisms.",

VAMP2/synaptobrevin, a v-SNARE involved in synaptic exocytosis (Martin et al., 2013; S\u00f6llner et al., 1993), possesses a conserved juxtamembrane motif linking the force-generating SNARE motif to the transmembrane domain (Figure 1A; Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011). Buried in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, the juxtamembrane motif contains hydrophobic residues that insert into the nonpolar phase of the lipid bilayer as well as basic residues localized to the polar phase of the membrane (Figure 1B; Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011; Ellena et al., 2009; Kweon et al., 2003). The juxtamembrane motif is critical for exocytosis in vivo (Borisovska et al.,2012; DeMill et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2009), but its role in the membrane fusion reaction has remained unclear.",

The kinetics of the liposome fusion reactions were measured using lipid and content mixing assays (Yu et al., 2019). The conserved residues of the juxtamembrane motif were mutated into alanines, and the VAMP2 mutant was reconstituted into proteoliposomes at the same density as the wild-type (WT) protein (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1A). We observed that the SNARE-Muncl8-1-mediated fusion reaction was strongly inhibited when the juxtamembrane motif was mutated (Figures 2C\u20132E, S1B, and S2). In contrast, the basal SNARE-driven fusion (without Munc18-1) was not affected by the mutation (Figures 2C\u20132E and S2). The selective involvement of the juxtamembrane motif in the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction is consistent with the discovery that basal SNARE-driven fusion is fundamentally distinct from the SM protein-assisted fusion pathway (Baker et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018). The SNARE-SM-mediated fusion reaction, but not basal SNARE-driven fusion, recapitulates intracellular vesicle fusion (Walter et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2015, 2018).",

Thus, the juxtamembrane motif is dispensable for SNARE complex assembly, consistent with the ability of the VAMP2 mutant to drive normal basal fusion (Figures 2C and 2D). Next, we examined whether the juxtamembrane motif regulates SNARE-Munc18-1 association. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we observed that the affinity of Munc18-1 binding to the WT SNARE complex was similar to its binding to the mutant SNARE complex in which the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 was mutated (Figure 3B). We then further examined SNARE-Munc18-1 binding using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. We observed that mutation of the juxtamembrane motif did not impair the interaction of GST-Munc18-1 with the SNARE complex (Figure 3C), in agreement with the ITC results. Thus, although selectively required for the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction, the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is dispensable for formation of the SNARE-Munc18-1 complex.",

It has been speculated that electrostatic interactions between the basic residues and lipid head groups are involved in the vesicle fusion reaction (Montal, 1999; Williams et al., 2009). Direct evidence for this model, however, has been lacking. Next, we examined the functional role of a conserved stretch of basic residues (K85/R86/K87) in the juxtamembrane motif (Figure 4A). We observed that SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion was strongly inhibited when the K85/R86/K87 (KRK) stretch was deleted or mutated into alanines (Figure 4B), indicating a critical role of these residues in the fusion reaction. We reasoned that, if the KRK stretch promotes membrane fusion through electrostatic interactions with lipids, then its activity should rely on the overall charge rather than specific amino acids. To test this possibility, the KRK sequence was substituted with triple lysines (KKK) or triple arginines (RRR) (Figure 4A), both of which retained the overall charge of the juxtamembrane motif. Indeed, VAMP2 variants bearing the KKK or RRR substitutions were fully active in mediating SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion (Figure 4B). We then replaced the KRK sequence with six histidine residues (His6), which are weakly basic at pH 7.4 (Figure 4A). We found that the VAMP2 variant bearing the His6 substitution also supported SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion, albeit with a lower efficiency (Figure 4B), consistent with partial protonation of histidine side chains at neutral pH. By contrast, substitution of the KRK stretch with acidic residues (EDE) abrogated SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion (Figure 4B). None of these mutations significantly affected basal SNARE-driven fusion (Figure 4B), confirming the dispensability of the juxtamembrane motif in the basal fusion reaction. These data demonstrate that the function of the juxtamembrane motif in membrane fusion requires the basic residues.",

In contrast, peptides derived from other SNARE sequences, including the N-peptide of syntaxin-1 and the Vc peptide of VAMP2, did not induce content release (Figures 5B and 5C). Because membrane disruption is often accompanied by lipid mixing (Bailey et al., 1997; Thor\u00e9n et al., 2005), we next examined whether the SNARE-derived peptides can induce liposome lipid mixing. Indeed, the juxtamembrane motif peptide, but not the N-peptide or Vc peptide, induced lipid mixing of protein-free liposomes (Figure S4), correlating with the membrane-disrupting activity of the juxtamembrane motif peptide (Figures 5B and 5C). Next, we used negative staining electron microscopy to visualize the effect of the juxtamembrane motif peptide on liposome morphology.

We observed that, although mutations of the juxtamembrane motif abolished SNARE-Munc18-1 mediated liposome fusion, the fusion was restored when the TatP59W peptide was introduced into the juxtamembrane region of VAMP2 (Figure 6B). Thus, the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 can be replaced by an unrelated bilayer-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction, further demonstrating that the juxtamembrane motif promotes membrane fusion by destabilizing the lipid bilayer.",

However, it was unclear whether and how the linker insertions directly influence the vesicle fusion reaction. Next, we introduced helix-breaking glycine and serine residues between the SNARE motif and juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 (Figure 7A). We observed that these linker insertions had little effect on the basal SNARE-driven liposome fusion reaction (Figure 7B). Insertion of 21 residues only moderately reduced the basal SNARE-driven liposome fusion, whereas shorter insertions had no effect on the fusion kinetics (Figure 7B). We then examined how the linker insertions affect the SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated fusion reaction. We found that insertion of two residues resulted in normal fusion kinetics (Figure 7B). However, further extension of the linker strongly inhibited SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated liposome fusion (Figure 7B). With seven or more helix-disrupting residues added, the liposome fusion reaction was essentially reduced to the basal level (Figure 7B), similar to mutations of the juxtamembrane motif (Figures 2 and 4).",

In this work, we discovered that the membrane-embedded juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 promotes membrane fusion by destabilizing the lipid bilayer. This membrane-destabilizing function is supported by three lines of evidence: (1) mutations or deletions of the lipid-binding residues in the juxtamembrane motif inhibit SNARE-Munc18-1-mediated membrane fusion; (2) the juxtamembrane motif is intrinsically capable of disrupting lipid bilayer structures; and (3) an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide can replace the juxtamembrane motif in promoting membrane fusion. Because the juxtamembrane motif is conserved among v-SNAREs, we anticipate that its membrane-destabilizing function is required for all vesicle fusion pathways. With the discovery of a membrane-destabilizing peptide in intracellular vesicle fusion, we suggest that biological membrane fusion pathways, although driven by disparate proteins, are governed by a common principle: assembly or refolding of membrane fusion proteins brings two lipid bilayers into close proximity, followed by local disruption of the bilayer structure by membrane-destabilizing peptides.",

            "text": "How does the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE destabilize the membrane bilayer? Electron microscopy (EM) imaging showed that the juxtamembrane motif deforms the membrane bilayer, which creates local elastic stresses and reduces the energy barrier for membrane merging (Kozlov et al., 2010; McMahon et al., 2010). Curvature induction usually requires the cooperative action of multiple copies of a membrane-binding molecule (Hui et al., 2009; McMahon et al., 2010) so that the juxtamembrane motif is unable to induce curvature within free v-SNAREs. When multiple SNARE complexes (three or more) zipper cooperatively in a vesicle fusion reaction (Domanska et al., 2009; Mohrmann et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2012), it is conceivable that their juxtamembrane motifs are concentrated at the fusion sites, allowing curvature induction. This curvature-inducing activity can be recapitulated by adding high concentrations of synthetic juxtamembrane motif peptides (Figure 5D). The juxtamembrane peptide of the v-SNARE may also promote dehydration of lipid head groups, which disrupts membrane integrity and neutralizes negative lipid charges to reduce the repulsive force of approaching membranes (Martens and McMahon, 2008; Murray et al., 1999; Shintou et al., 2007; Tarafdar et al., 2015). Interestingly, in the post-fusion cis-SNARE complex, the juxtamembrane motif associates with the t-SNAREs (Stein et al., 2009), suggesting that the juxtamembrane motif is dislodged from the membrane during a late stage of the fusion reaction. It is conceivable that dislodging of the juxtamembrane motif further disrupts the membrane structure at the fusion sites. Before its ultimate pairing with the t-SNAREs, the dislodged juxtamembrane motif may also transiently bind and destabilize the target membrane in trans. Together, these membrane-remodeling activities facilitate lipid rearrangements to form stalk and hemifusion intermediates, followed by opening and expansion of fusion pores controlled by SNARE transmembrane domains (Bao et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2015; Dhara et al., 2016; Fang and Lindau, 2014; Lindau et al., 2012; Ngatchou et al., 2010; Pieren et al., 2015).",

Only the SNARE-SM-mediated fusion recapitulates the intracellular vesicle fusion reaction. We posit that, without activation by a cognate SM protein, SNARE zippering proceeds through a different route that is not properly coupled to the activity of the juxtamembrane motif. Consistent with this model, the basal SNARE-driven fusion is insensitive to linker insertions, in stark contrast to the SNARE-SM-mediated fusion reaction. In a reconstituted fusion assay containing the Vc peptide, mutations of the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 decreased fusion kinetics (Hernandez et al., 2012). This observation can be explained by the discovery that the Vc peptide-assisted fusion reaction mimics SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion rather than the basal fusion reaction (Yu et al., 2018). Although the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 can associate with t-SNARE and Munc18-1 (Stein et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010), our and others\u2019 data showed that the juxtamembrane motif is dispensable for SNARE-SNARE and SNARE-Munc18-1 interactions (Figure 3; Jiao et al., 2018).",

However, this region lacks a hydrophobic stretch and is not known to penetrate into the surface of membrane bilayers (Lam et al., 2008). Thus, the juxtamembrane region of syntaxin may not act as a membrane-destabilizing peptide in the fusion reaction. Instead, the lipid-binding activity of this region may regulate syntaxin localization and/or modulate other exocytic factors. As discussed above, the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE may bind and destabilize the target membrane in trans after its dislodging from the vesicle membrane, promoting lipid rearrangements in both membrane bilayers.",

In regulated exocytosis, the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE is expected to act in concert with other membrane-remodeling molecules, such as synaptotagmin and Doc2b, to accelerate the fusion kinetics (Hui et al., 2009; Lynch et al., 2008; Martens et al., 2007; Martens and McMahon, 2008). Overall, our biochemical data agree well with genetic observations (Borisovska et al., 2012; De\u00e1k et al., 2006; DeMill et al., 2014; Kesavan et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2009). However, it should be noted that the juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 also modulates the activities of specialized exocytic regulators such as Munc13 and complexin (Fang et al., 2013; Maximov et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019). Because these binding modes can play opposite roles in exocytosis, mutations of specific residues in the juxtamembrane motif may lead to variable consequences in vivo, depending on cellular contexts and the nature of the mutations (Borisovska et al., 2012; Maximov et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009).",

Detergent was removed by overnight dialysis using Novagen dialysis tubes against the reconstitution buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). To prepare sulforhodamine B-loaded liposomes for content-mixing assays, v- and t-SNAREs were reconstituted in the presence of 50 mM sulforhodamine B. Free sulforhodamine B was removed by overnight dialysis followed by liposome flotation on a Nycodenz gradient. The protein: lipid ratio of v-SNARE liposomes was 1:200, similar to VAMP2 densities on native synaptic vesicles (Takamori et al., 2006), while the protein: lipid ratio of t-SNARE liposomes was 1:500. SNARE mutants were reconstituted into liposomes at the same molar densities as their respective WT proteins. Protein-free liposomes were prepared in a similar way as SNARE liposomes except that proteins were omitted.",

The juxtamembrane motif of VAMP2 is based on previous biophysical and structural data (Bowen and Brunger, 2006; Brewer et al., 2011; Ellena et al., 2009; Kweon et al., 2003). The TMD of VAMP2 is tilted about 35\u00b0 relative to the membrane normal to allow the nonpolar residues of the juxtamembrane motif to insert into the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer and the basic residues to embed in the hydrophilic phase of the membrane. Carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus atoms of the lipid bilayer are colored gray, red, and green, respectively. The model is based on the structures of the v-SNARE (PDB: 2KOG; Ellena et al., 2009), the cis-SNARE complex (PDB: 3HD7; Stein et al., 2009), and Munc18-1 (PDB: 3PUJ; Hu et al., 2011).
