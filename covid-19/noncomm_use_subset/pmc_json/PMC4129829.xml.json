            "text": "It is important to understand how historical factors have impacted on the establishment of TCM theory. During the period between 770BCE and 200BCE when Huangdi Nei Jing was written, science and technology around the world was still in its na\u00efve form, therefore the study of medicine would not be carried out by sophisticated experiments, and rather it was via direct observation and clinical practice. The basic TCM theory was generated by the involvement of ancient Chinese philosophies such as the Taoist school, Confucianism, Huang-Lao doctrines (to name a few but not limited to this) to induct and deduct the section of the knowledge and experiences that came from the observation and clinical practices.[8] These TCM theories have been used as guidelines for clinical practices and at the same time were tested so that, eventually, by dumping incorrect and incoherent knowledge or theory, they were converted into a better form of TCM theory. There are obviously marked connections that can be identified between ancient Chinese philosophies and TCM theory, for example: from the harmony between man and nature of the Taoist school and Confucianism to the holistic approach concept of TCM;[8] from \u201ctao\u201d (universal principal) and \u201cqi\u201d (vital material) of Huang-Lao doctrines to the viscera doctrine of TCM;[8] from Yin Yang Xiao Xi (yearly variation of yin and yang) and Wu De Zhuan Yi (transfer of five virtues) of naturalists to the theory of yin-yang and five elements of TCM;[8] and from Zhong Yong Zhi Dao (the doctrine of the mean Confucian\u2014the harmony between human beings) of Confucianism to the harmony among Zang Fu (the viscera), Qi-Blood and Yin-Yang of TCM.[8]",

Laboratory studies have found that herbal formulas such as Bai Hu Tang,[9] Gui Zhi Tang,[9] Ma Huang Tang,[9] and Yin Qiao San[7] are effective in controlling viruses. The underlying mechanism of this effect is complex; it may be partially related to the immunomodulatory effects of the formulas on viral infectious diseases.[13] A clinical trial[14] also showed the effect of herbal formulas on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 16 patients without using glucocorticoids, anti-viral agents, immune-regulators or antibiotics. The authors concluded that TCM intervention could effectively control or alleviate the symptoms of the disease and prevent the disease from exacerbation.",

Liu et al[7] treated 126 cases of EHF by intravenous drip of 40\u201360 mL of Shuang Du Qing Zhu She Ye (an intravenous liquid consisting of rhubarb, skutellaria root, polygonum cuspidatum, and salvia etc.) added with 500mLof 5% glucose liquid. The drip was given once a day for 5 days, as a course of treatment. The complication rate after the treatment was 9.5% but all cases recovered, whereas in 63 controls, 3 died. Li et al[7] treated 36 cases of EHF by intravenous drip of 3.6\u20134.8 g of Shuang Huang Lian Fen Zhen Ji (an injection consisting of honeysuckle flower, forsythia fruit, and coptis root), added with 250\u2013500 mL of 5% glucose liquid, once a day. Thirty cases fully recovered from the disease, and no deaths occurred. The outcome of this group was better than the control group, who were treated by virazole. In the treatment of 30 cases of viral meningoencephalitis, Zhu et al[7] used modified Qing Ying Tang, consisting of gypsum (30 g), isatis root (30 g), cornu bubali (30 g [boiled before other ingredients]), honeysuckle flower (20 g), rehmannia dried root (20 g), forsythia fruit (15 g), skutellaria root (15 g), antelope horn bone (15 g [boiled before other ingredients]), wind-weed rhizome (15 g), cortexmoutan(15 g), red paeonia(15 g). When the patient suffered from seizures, uncaria, batryticated silkworm, earthworm, periostracum cicadae, and white peony root were added. If the patient had a coma, calamus and radixcurcumae were added. It was found the outcome of combined medicine was better than that of biomedicine alone.",
