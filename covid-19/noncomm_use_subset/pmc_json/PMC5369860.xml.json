The lateral and medial sesamophalangeal ligaments were torn or pulled off forcibly from their distal attachment to the proximal phalanx base upon further investigation of the sesamoid complex. Then the sesamoids retracted proximally. No fracture of the two sesamoids was observed. After the reduction was achieved, the level of stability and the movement range were verified and checked to be was expected. The first ray length seemed to be regained and back to its normal function.

The first MTP joint is different from the articulations of the lesser toes since it contains the two sesamoids which are linked to the proximal phalanx and they are also placed in the thick fibrous plantar plate [7]. A thick intersesamoidal ligament acts as an attachment agent for each other to work in tandem. In addition, the two sesamoids have been observed to move in connection with the phalanx. The plantar plate or first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule is more or less weaker at its metatarsal insertion [3]. Furthermore, the lateral and medial sesamoids of the first metatarsophalangeal joint exist inside the identical tendons of flexor hallucis brevis going into the lateral and medial aspects of the big toe proximal phalanx, with adductor hallucis and abductor. As such, this can explain why the sesamoid complex is always with the proximal phalanx and not following the metatarsal head in the action of traumatic displacements process.",

After that, a dislocation of Type III was also discussed and described: the description provides more information on how the sesamoids and plantar plate stay in their anatomic location while at the same time the conjoined tendons and the phalangeosesamoid ligaments were found to experience rupture [16]. Early further classified dislocations of Type III into two subtypes known as IIIA and IIIB [17]. As for dislocation of Type IIIA, a complete plantar plate rupture of the proximal phalanx base without sesamoid fracture is being observed. On the other hand, dislocation of Type IIIB includes complete rupture of the plantar plate accompanied with sesamoid fracture, which is not in Type IIIA as already explained above. A combination of type IIA and IIB as described by Jahss, both Copeland and Kanat produced a description of type IIC [18]. Copeland and Kanat reported the intersesamoidal ligament rupture in connection with a forcibly torn-off fracture of the fibular sesamoid of the type.",

In our patient, the tibial sesamoid was proximally dislocated in particular, and both the tibial and the fibular sesamoid did not change as it continued to be plantar to the first metatarsal. Jahss [16] described a similar case of a patient who presented after nine weeks of the injury passed. In order to realize salvage, a resection arthroplasty and an open reduction of the proximal phalanx was carried out. Similar cases were shown through X-rays by Giannikas et al. [2] in their report; the diagnosis was carried out after three weeks from the injury with no comments or feedback on the pathology issues and results.",
