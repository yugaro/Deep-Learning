            "text": "Influenza A viruses infect approximately 5-15% of the population, resulting in 250-500 thousands deaths each year 1. The most widely used class of drugs for treatment of clinical influenza is the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir and zanamivir. The clinical impact of these drugs is limited by the development of antiviral drug resistance. Specifically, decreased efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors has been reported against seasonal H1N1 influenza and 2009 novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza, as well as avian influenza H5N1 virus 2-9. In addition, initiation of antiviral therapy in influenza A virus-infected individuals beyond the first 48-72 hours after the onset of influenza symptoms is associated with greater mortality and decreased antiviral efficacy compared with treatment initiated within 48-72 hours of symptom onset 10-15. These caveats underscore the need to develop novel and effective influenza therapeutic strategies. Further investigation of other intervention strategies which have shown promising results against influenza A viruses in vitro but have not been investigated in vivo are warranted.",

There are three types of NOS: constituent and calcium-dependant isoforms that are principally present in endothelial and neuronal cells (eNOS and nNOS, respectively), and the inducible or calcium-independent isoform, iNOS 16. In the airways, NOS is present in a variety of cells, including macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, airway epithelial cells and neurons where NOS activity is known to mediate neurotransmission, smooth muscle contraction and mucin secretions. NO is also a well known biological mediator in the host response to infection 16, 17. Various inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and cytokines including IFNg and TNF can cause high and sustained NO production by iNOS; depending on the species, strain, infection dose and pathogen entry route, iNOS activity can result in pro- or anti-inflammatory responses, cytotoxicity, or cytoprotection [reviewed in 16].",

Inhaled NO delivery would provide a safer and easier delivery method rather than administration of NO donors, as iNO is approved for treating term and near-term neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure up to a dose of 80 parts per million (ppm) 26, 27. It has been reported that exogenous gaseous NO (gNO) at a high dose of no less than 160 ppm and with five hours of continuous exposure, can elicit a non-specific antimicrobial response against a broad range of microorganisms in vitro 28.

Care, 50 11 (2005), pp. 1451-1456. | View Record in Scopus |. In vivo, 160 ppm iNO treatment would result in NO binding to hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, resulting in reduced oxygen transport and hypoxemia, as well as the potential for elevated levels of the harmful NO metabolite NO2. However, Miller et al. 29 has shown that gNO in an intermittent delivery regimen of 160 ppm for 30 min every 3.5 hours can prevent methemoglobinemia and reduce the potential of host cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo (Miller C, personal communication), while retaining antimicrobial properties in vitro.",

Since iNO was administered both prior to and for 5 days post-infection, we were able to test whether iNO at intermediate (80 ppm) or high concentration (160 ppm) could prevent either viral entry or viral replication in vivo, and thereby reduce viral load. Continuous iNO at 80 ppm, intermittent iNO at 160 ppm, and compressed room air administration yielded similar lung viral loads of infected mice on day 5 post-infection (Fig. 3a and b, respectively).

Rather, methemoglobinemia, defined as 7% methemoglobin in Davidson et al. 38, was more likely to occur. Methemoglobinemia may account for the decrease in survival observed in our study with continuous iNO administration at 80 ppm. NO2 concentrations were measured daily over the course of infection and kept below 2 ppm as is acceptable in humans, however, lung toxicity may still explain these results as the toxic threshold in mice may be lower. On the other hand, given previous in vitro findings by McMullen et al. 28, 80 ppm may also have been too low of a concentration to provide an antiviral effect.",
