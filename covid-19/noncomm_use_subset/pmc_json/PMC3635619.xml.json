It is one of the important causes of acute respiratory infection and causes disease in any age group. However, the infection rate is higher among infants and children.1-4 It also accounts for other complications like pneumonia, viremia, myositis, myocardial dysfunction and encephalopathy.5 The H1N1 09 spread in 214 countries with more than 18306 deaths.6 Developing countries are comparatively at more risk because of lack of hygiene, overpopulation, poverty and scarcity of modern tools for the diagnosis and treatment. The influenza virus is known for continuous antigenic change through antigenic drift and shift.7 This property of the virus has a significant effect on prevention (vaccination), diagnosis and treatment. Although an emergence of new strain of the virus cannot be stopped, its spread from the origin might be limited by preventing country to country transmission. It has been reported that more than 90.0% of cases of H1N1 endemic occurred in England by in-country transmission.4,8 From the 2 pandemics (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and H1N1 09) in the last decade, it is clear that rapid identification and proper surveillance tremendously help respond to the outbreak in short time, providing security to global public health.",

As the virus is seasonal, the vaccine needs to be prepared according to the prediction that certain strain would circulate in a particular season.9 Also, antiviral agents against influenza are found to be effective when used early in the course of illness. There are four drugs available against influenza virus: amantadine, rimantidine, zanamivir and oseltamivir.10 Some studies have reported the resistance pattern of the H1N1 09 virus to amantadine and oseltamivir.11-13 Rapid detection of such resistance is clinically important in reducing the time between diagnosis and initiation of individualized therapy. Therefore, close monitoring of the prevalence of antiviral resistance and discoveries of drugs and potent vaccines are necessary to control influenza burden.",

However, diagnosis by a physician is difficult because many of the respiratory viruses produce similar symptoms like influenza. Therefore, clinical laboratory diagnosis is mandatory for correct and early diagnosis. Although several tests have been developed to detect influenza viruses, they have different sensitivity, specificity, throughput, cost, availability, and other factors involved in from pre-analytical to post-analytical stages of clinical laboratory testing. These factors play a crucial role in the selection of diagnostic test method in the clinical laboratory. Use of highly sensitive and specific test to yield accurate result in relatively short time is beneficial to patients by reducing the adverse effects and complications with the use of appropriate drugs and antiviral therapy on time.14",

After inoculation, the viruses cause cytopathology, which is different according to the cell type used. It takes around 10 to 14 days to get the result which delays initiation of antiviral therapy or infection control methods.9,21,22 Human respiratory epithelial cells are also known to enhance the growth of influenza virus.23 The shell vial culture (SVC) method was introduced in 1990s.24 The combination of SVC and certain monoclonal antibodies have been found to decrease the turnaround time along with increased sensitivity and specificity.25 On the other hand, a commercial R-Mix cell (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA) is found to be more sensitive than the other cell culture techniques. It's a cell mixture containing Mink Lung epithelial cells and A549 cells. The use of this cell mixture can give result after 24-48 h of inoculation.26 R-mix Too is another cell mixture of MDCK and A549 cells. It can detect respiratory viruses and amplifies their replication. In order to identify H1N1 09 specifically, the kit named D3 Ultra 2009 H1N1 Influenza A ID kit (2009 H1N1 ID kit; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH, USA) is developed which utilizes the R-mix Too cells.

To meet this aim, rapid tests to detect influenza virus have evolved. In the past decade, several tests have been developed and the use of rapid tests is found to flourish day in day out. This is true because of their ability to provide test results within about half an hour with easy interpretability. Although these tests have not been able to gain trustworthiness because of several limitations like frequent false positivity and false negativity, they are known to yield better results with sample having higher titer, as in children than in adult cases.31 Especially in developing countries where the PCR technique is not available in primary health care settings, they aid in clinical decision making and have been found to be used solely for diagnostic purpose. These tests are handy and also known as near patient or point of care testing methods. Today's focus on rapid identification of influenza should be centered to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these tests, so that they can be of potential use in early and accurate diagnosis of influenza.",

In one study using QuickVue Influenza A+B (Quidel) with reference as RT-PCR, they found the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of H1N1 09 was 20.0% and 99.0%, respectively, suggesting the use of RT-PCR for the clinical diagnosis.29 Other studies have, however, found its sensitivities up to 51.0% and 53.3% in comparison to RT-PCR.32,33 In another study using two rapid antigen tests, BD Directigen EZ flu and TruFlu, Meridian, they got a better performance with former kit than the later one. The sensitivity and specificity for H1N1 09 detection with BD Directigen EZ flu was 20.6% and 99.0%, whereas those of TruFlu, Meridian were 9.7% and 98.2%, respectively.34 Tsao, et al.,35 recently analyzed four rapid tests, namely BinaxNow test, QuickVue test, TRU test, and Formosa Rapid test, and found their detection limit to be lower than that of RT-PCR. Nevertheless, they found the sensitivity of Formosa Rapid test to be similar to QuickVue test, relatively more sensitive than the other 2 kits for H1N1 09 diagnosis. Furthermore, another study using SD Bioline Influenza Antigen Test\u00ae kit found a poor performance, with sensitivity and specificity of 44.0% and 99.9%, respectively, for H1N1 09 diagnosis.36 In contrast, a recent study has revealed 90.0% sensitive Actim Influenza A&B kit (Medix Biochemica, Joensuu, Finland) for the detection of influenza A virus among 1-3 years old children.37 The test performed with QuickVue influenza test in 6 months to 14 years of children showed 67.5% sensitivity and 96.0% specificity for influenza viruses.38 This indicates that pediatric group have generally higher viral load fair enough for the kits to detect the virus in comparison to adults or other patients. The next important thing about the rapid kits is that their sensitivity and specificity are inconsistent.31",

The time frame to obtain the results is between 2 and 4 h.40,41 The sensitivity of the DFA tests for influenza virus is found to be between 70.0% and 100.0%. Similarly, specificity ranges from 80.0% to 100.0%,22 indicating that the sensitivity is comparatively higher than that of rapid antigen detection kits and lower than the PCR tests. This means that the negative results need to be confirmed by the PCR-based assays. Although some studies recommend the use of DFA as well as SVC together, to increase the sensitivity of the test by 5.0-15.0% than the DFA alone, multiple virus infections cannot be ruled out.22 Recent study has shown that, particularly for H1N1, the sensitivity and specificity of DFA were 62.0% and 100.0%, respectively, when compared to RT-PCR, with variability in age. The performance of the test was better with children below 10 years of age, whereas the sensitivity of the test decreased with persons above 30 years of age.42 In contrast, the sensitivity of DFA was 93.0% with adult in a study by Pollock, et al.,41 in 2009 for H1N1 09. In another study, the sensitivity of DFA is shown to be lowered to 44.4% in comparison to RT-PCR for H1N1.43 Similarly, the study comparing DFA, rapid antigen test and RT-PCR showed that the former two tests have comparatively low sensitivity (38.7% and 18.2%, respectively) in comparison to RT-PCR, suggesting the confirmatory test as RT-PCR for H1N1 09.44",

For instance, one of the most widely used drugs against influenza infection, oseltamivir resistance, arises due to histidine to tyrosine substitution in the neuraminidase active site (H275Y).56 The techniques available to monitor the drug resistance include neuraminidase inhibition assay, pyrosequencing, use of genotype specific primers, or real time RT-PCR,56 all of which have been known to be time consuming. Sequencing methods such as pyrosequencing provide detailed genetic information about the resistance pattern and also estimate relative proportion of variant and wild-type viruses in a mixed population sample and can be applied directly in clinical setting.57 However, they need additional steps after initial PCR, specialized person to operate the sequencing instruments and the softwares.24 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR provides a rapid, highly sensitive, and specific alternative to sequencing.24 However, it is either specific for seasonal influenza A or needs multiple primers to detect H1N1 09.56 RT-PCR, combined with pyrogram techniques, has provided the detection of H275Y sequences in H1N1 09 within 8 h with sensitivity similar to pyrosequencing method for seasonal H1N1.56 Similarly, cycling probe real-time PCR assay has been shown to provide test results within 3 h after receiving the samples for resistance to oseltamivir and also to be able to detect both seasonal as well as H1N1 09 viruses resistant to oseltamivir.58 However, the major drawback is that new sets of primers and probes have to be developed in the event when a novel drug-resistant strain would emerge during treatment.58",

Sole interpretation by a clinician, based on the symptoms presented by a patient, is not specific, as the virus has symptoms common to other known respiratory viruses. Therefore, clinicians are always in need of a confirmatory test for the influenza infection as soon as the illness initiates. The culture methods are time-consuming and are not as sensitive and specific as to make clinicians to start with antiviral therapy. However, they are still being used in many laboratories, suggesting that the influenza diagnosis by culture methods needs substantial quality check and continuous monitoring to increase the quality of report. The fast and specific RIDTs, also called as point of care tests, are also not appropriate for the diagnosis of influenza virus because of their poor performance. However, they are simple, cheap, easily interpretable and handy. If they had been showing similar or better performance than that of PCR-based assays, they would have been the major technique to detect the influenza virus. However, they too need to be studied well and improved to the extent where they can be used for accurate and specific diagnosis of the virus.",

However, we cannot deny the fact that these popular models also have several limitations, ranging from nucleic acid extraction to result interpretation. Even a negligible amount of error has potential effect on the result interpretation of the highly sensitive tests. Therefore, they have also higher possibilities of yielding false positive results in comparison to viral culture methods. Thus, validation of reagents, application of proper positive and negative controls, and use of automation could reduce the chances of errors in molecular diagnosis of influenza infection. On the other hand, cell culture methods and RIDTs should undergo standardization, quality assurance and quality control measures in order to validate the results. Hence, further studies are needed to validate the interpretation of influenza virus diagnostic techniques. Besides many merits and demerits, PCR based-assays are so far suggested technique for the diagnosis of influenza virus. Therefore, clinicians should rely on the RT-PCR test results of patient and correlate with the clinical aspects of the patient.",
