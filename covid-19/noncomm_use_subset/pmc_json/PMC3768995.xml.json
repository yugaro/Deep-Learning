Epidemiological studies from tropical regions indicate that factors as rainy seasons (34) or low air humidity (3), in addition to temperature, may influence respiratory viruses outbreaks. Global warming carries profound changes in Earth\u2019s climate, and major changes in the atmosphere and in the climate have a vast impact on the biosphere and the human environment (20). Consequently, climatic variations and extreme weather events also cause profound impacts on infectious diseases incidences. Infectious agents (such as protozoa, bacteria and viruses) are devoid of thermostatic mechanisms, and reproduction and survival rates are thus strongly affected by fluctuations in temperature. Temperature dependencies are seen in correlations between disease rates and weather variations over weeks, months or years, as well as in close geographic associations with key climatic variables and the distributions of important infectious diseases (28).",

Patients were children between one month and six years of age attended between May 2004 and September 2005, suffering from ARI. A single nurse was responsible for collecting the samples during the whole study. Nasopharyngeal washes were obtained after instillation of 0.5ml of sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline \u2013 NaCl, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4) into each nostril with immediate aspiration through a sterile neonatal canula inserted into the child\u2019s nasopharynx. The sample was transferred to a sterile vial and immediately transported to the laboratory, processed and frozen at \u201386\u00b0C in Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for later RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. This method was chosen because of its high specificity and sensibility, besides being a rapid test for the identification of many pathogens, including respiratory viruses.

It is observed that there is a moderate fluctuation of temperature over the period of study (about 10 \u00b0 C). Thus, it was verified a statistical significant association (p=0.010) between HRSV identification and monthly average of minimal temperature, showing that in Southeast Brazil this virus presents a correlation to periods that temperatures are lower. In contrast to our observations, Omer et al. (2008) observed an association of higher HRSV incidence with the increase of rainfall and temperature; however, it is necessary to consider that this study was performed on an island population, at sea level in a tropical equatorial region.",

Associating HRSV with HRV outbreaks, it was possible to verify that in 2004 HRSV had a major detection rate in late winter and spring; and comparing with the same period in 2005 it was verified that HRV had a higher prevalence, almost occurring an inversion on the incidences of these viruses in this period. An explanation for it would be the genotypes of HRSV circulating in 2004 and 2005. Children infected by HRSV in 2004 could obtain a better immune response to this virus in 2005, therefore leaving better conditions for HRV infections.",
