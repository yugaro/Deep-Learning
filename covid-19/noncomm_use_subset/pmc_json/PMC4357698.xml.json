Alu elements can be part of a polymerase II transcription unit and are therefore present in pre-mRNAs and mRNAs.

Our studies demonstrate that Alu RNPs interfere with the formation of the 48S complex by a novel mechanism in which Alu RNPs act directly on the 40S ribosomal subunit to prevent its association with the mRNA. Moreover, the SRP9/14 protein dimer constitutes the inhibitory component, which has to be transferred to 40S by the Alu RNA. This mechanism efficiently inhibits cap-dependent as well as IRES-mediated translation initiation. Overexpression of Alu RNA in HEK 293T cells inhibits in an SRP9/14-dependent fashion translation of mRNAs that initiate protein synthesis de novo. Our results are consistent with a physiological role of Alu RNPs in the translational response to viral infection and stress.",

To investigate whether the cap structure and the 5\u2032 UTR affect the inhibitory activity of Alu RNPs, we generated reporter constructs in which the Firefly luciferase coding sequence (Fluc) was fused to the 5\u2032 UTRs of the \u03b2-globin (\u03b2-glo), \u03b2-actin (\u03b2-act) and LINE-1 (L1) mRNAs.

Uncapped and capped transcripts of the three reporter constructs were translated in RRL in the presence of AluYA and scAluYA RNPs. Translation efficiencies were not significantly different between the capped and uncapped transcripts and between the reporter mRNAs comprising different 5\u2032 UTRs (Figure 4A).

This is further supported by the fact that all h9/14 bound quantitatively to 40S subunits even when present in a 2-fold molar excess over 40S indicating that it has more than one binding site on the 40S subunit (Supplementary Figure S6). In contrast the presence of 2-fold molar excess of scAluYA RNP over 40S did not increase the amount of the 40S-bound h9/14 suggesting that in this case the binding is saturable and occurs most likely to one specific site on the ribosome.",

To assess this hypothesis, we supplemented the RRL translation reaction containing scAluYA RNP with an equal amount or a 2-fold excess of h9/14.

The competition between 40S and Alu RNA may also explain why the inhibitory effect of Alu RNPs saturated at around 50% (Figure 1B and F).

Both Alu RNPs were incubated individually with 40S subunits and the complexes analyzed by sucrose gradients (Figure 5E). As observed in similar experiments with the protein alone (24), h9/14A5 was absent from the 40S fractions whereas h9-3A/14 bound as efficiently as the wild type protein to 40S subunits. These results indicated that SRP9/14 binding to the 40S subunit was required but not sufficient for Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of 48S complex formation. Supplementing the translation reactions containing scAluYA RNP with equimolar amounts of h9/14A5 did not significantly change the inhibitory activity of the scAluYA RNP (Figure 5F, right panel). However, a 2-fold excess of h9/14A5 over the scAluYA RNP diminished the inhibitory effect. Binding of h9/14 to Alu RNAs is characterized by high on and off-rates (25). In the presence of an excess of h9/14A5 over the wild-type protein, the latter was presumably exchanged with the mutated protein forming the inactive scAluYA 14A5 RNP, which lead to a loss in the inhibitory activity of the RNP.",

For five out of six reporter mRNAs tested, luciferase expression levels were significantly higher in cells expressing the mutated scAluYNF1 RNA than in cells expressing the wild type RNA (Figure 6C).

Additionally, protein analysis by SDS-PAGE did not reveal any noticeable changes in the expression of specific proteins at high levels of scAluYNF1 RNA (Supplementary Figure S8B). We therefore reasoned that the Alu RNP-mediated decrease in active 40S subunits might severely hamper protein synthesis from mRNAs starting translation de novo such as the newly synthesized reporter mRNAs whereas protein synthesis from polysome-associated mRNAs remained largely unaffected. Ribosomal subunits are presumably recycled via a closed-loop structure in already existing polysomes (44). To strengthen this hypothesis we performed two experiments. First, we expressed an estradiol-inducible luciferase reporter plasmid in HEK 293T cells along with the scAluYNF1 RNA-expressing or the control plasmid. Fluc mRNA synthesis was induced by the addition of estradiol to the culture medium at 24 h post-transfection and luciferase activity was monitored during the next 24 h. While luciferase expression increased rapidly in control cells, it was strongly delayed in scAluYNF1 RNA-expressing cells (Figure 6D) consistent with our working hypothesis that reduced concentrations of active 40S subunits hampered de novo initiation (Figure 6D).",

VSV induces a shutdown of host translation by interfering with eIF4F complex formation (34). Although VSV mRNAs are capped and do not contain IRES sequences, their translation proceeds via an unconventional mechanism, which bypasses the need of eIF4F for initiation (35). HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either scAluYNF1 or the 4.5S control RNA. After 48 h, cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 10) and harvested 6 h later by which time the host translation machinery was reprogrammed by VSV mRNAs. In cells overexpressing scAluYNF1 RNA we observed a reduction in viral protein synthesis by approximately 25% compared to cells expressing 4.5S RNA (Figure 6F).

We present evidence that Alu RNPs inhibit translation by interacting directly with the 40S subunit, although only SRP9/14 remains bound to 40S whereas the Alu RNA is released and can act in another round of SRP9/14 binding to 40S. Binding of SRP9/14 prevents the recruitment of the 43S complex to the mRNA, possibly because the entry of the mRNA into the small subunit is directly or indirectly blocked. In cells, this mechanism interferes with translation initiation on viral and reporter mRNAs, and cellular mRNAs that resume the translation cycle after stress-induced shutdown of protein synthesis. The same mechanism of translation regulation is likely to be used in rodents and tree shrews, which also contain Alu-like elements in their genomes.",

The Alu RNA is not part of the inactive 40S-SRP9/14 complexes and is therefore able to function in several rounds of SRP9/14 targeting to the 40S subunit (Figure 5F). This conclusion is supported by a parallel study from our laboratory (24). In this study, we show that upon addition of the 40S subunit to an Alu RNP immobilized on beads via its RNA moiety, a fraction of SRP9/14 dissociates within minutes from the RNA to bind to the 40S subunit. Indeed, SRP9/14 appears to equilibrate between the two binding partners (Figure 5A, C, D and (24)) suggesting that the functional binding site of SRP9/14 in 40S has a similar affinity for SRP9/14 as Alu RNA. The capacity of SRP9/14 to exchange rapidly between binding partners has already previously been observed (25) and is consistent with a high off rate of the SRP14-9 fusion protein from a 7SL-Alu domain RNA (36).",

The affinity of 40S for SRP9/14 would be insufficient to compete with these RNAs for SRP9/14 binding. A plausible explanation for the mutually exclusive binding of SRP9/14 to Alu RNA or to 40S subunits is to presume that the basic \u03b2-sheet formed by the two proteins, which represents the major binding domain for Alu RNA (37), will also be involved in binding the 40S subunit, most likely via the 18S ribosomal RNA. The targeted delivery of SRP9/14 to a functionally important site in 40S also predicts that the Alu RNA itself transiently interact with the 40S subunit guiding SRP9/14 to its proper binding site.",

            "text": "The essential feature in the protein for 40S-binding and for initiation inhibition is the C-terminal pentapeptide of SRP14 (Figure 2E and F). Short basic oligopeptides are frequently present in ribosomal and ribosome-binding proteins and have been shown to bind ribosomal RNA (38,39) (Supplementary Figure S9). The three residues K60, K61 and K64 in SRP9 are essential for the elongation arrest function of SRP (21) and are also required for 40S subunit inactivation (Figure 2E and F). However, they are not required for 40S binding. Interestingly, in SRP-ribosome- nascent chain complex these residues are located in close proximity to 40S (40). Further studies will be required to determine the binding sites of SRP9/14 on the 40S subunit and whether the protein uses the same binding site in either function. Our data showed that SRP9/14 can be delivered to the 43S complex (Figures 1I and 5D) but not to the 80S ribosome (Figure 5C). This suggests that protein-binding site is not occupied by the ternary complex, eIF3, eIF1 and 1A but is blocked by the presence of the 60S subunit. The protein SRP9/14 alone had no inhibitory activity, which is consistent with earlier observations that high levels of SRP9/14 are well tolerated in primate cells (11,41)",

In HeLa cells, Alu RNAs are about 500-fold less abundant than ribosomes and it is therefore unlikely that Alu RNPs inactivate an important fraction of 40S subunits. However, expression of specific Alu RNAs can be increased in certain tissues, like NDM29 RNA and BC200 RNA in the nervous tissue (6), and a transient increase in Alu RNA expression has been observed in response to viral infection and to various stresses (32,33,47). In addition, Alu RNA can act in several rounds of targeted delivery of the protein (Figure 5F) thereby multiplying the effect of its upregulation. The SRP9/14 is already present and Alu RNA levels increase within one hour and decline to normal levels within \u223c7 h after heat shock (47). Like other regulatory mechanisms in translation, the inhibitory action of the Alu RNP is therefore rapid and transient. It is therefore conceivable that lowering the pool of active 40S subunits might contribute to shaping the translational response in these adaptive processes and thereby also participate in cellular defense mechanisms used against viral infection. A recent study, which shows that HCV translation was more strongly affected by reduced cellular levels of 40S than cellular translation, supports this hypothesis (48).",
