            "text": "Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a major respiratory disease of chickens that is induced by avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV; also known as gallid herpesvirus 1). ILTV belongs to the Iltovirus genus within the Herpesviridae family. Infection with ILTV can induce a mild to severe upper respiratory tract disease in chickens, depending on the virulence of the virus, and it causes large economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide annually. Vaccination using live attenuated virus has been the most commonly used method to control ILT outbreaks since the mid-20th century. Vaccination infects naive chickens with live attenuated virus, thereby establishing latent viral carriers; however, it is not recommended that this vaccine be used in regions where ILT outbreaks are absent (1\u20134). The majority of currently used live attenuated virus vaccines can induce successful protection in chickens (5). New outbreaks of ILT are continually being identified in many countries, especially in regions where live attenuated vaccines have been extensively administered (6). A growing body of evidence from molecular typing data collected worldwide has revealed that the currently used live attenuated vaccine strains could generate, via recombination, a virulent virus that could be the cause of current outbreaks (7\u201312). Increasing concerns regarding the biosafety of live attenuated ILTV vaccines have triggered the development of recombinant vaccines using viral vectors, and these have been released in some countries (6). However, none of the currently available recombinant vaccines are able to clear latent virus from an infected host. As a consequence, a residual latent infection can induce new outbreaks under certain conditions when host immunity is compromised, such as under stress and at the onset of egg laying (13, 14). Therefore, novel strategies that are independent of the host immune system, such as tighter farm biosecurity and anti-ILTV breeding, are required to control ILT outbreaks. It is hoped that these new strategies that are being developed will improve the control of ILT and reduce the extensive use of live attenuated virus as vaccines.",

Many studies have investigated herpesvirus-host interactions in humans and mice; however, little is known about these interactions in chickens. Lee et al. explored the molecular events induced by ILTV infection in host cells using publicly available high-throughput data on host transcription profiles in chicken embryo lung cells infected with a virulent ILTV strain (18). A bioinformatic analysis revealed that several genes and pathways are significantly altered by ILTV infection; these findings were validated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Their study cast the first light on the molecular nature of the host response to ILTV infection. However, the underlying molecular basis of the host response remains largely unclear, and additional studies are urgently needed to address this issue.",

It is well-known that Src is an important factor for a wide range of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, organization of the cell skeleton, cell division, and cell death (20\u201324). The tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been shown to be required for integrin-stimulated cell migration and focal adhesion formation (25\u201327), the disruption of which triggers apoptosis (28, 29). The interaction between Src and FAK has been shown to promote the entry of human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) into target cells (30, 31). However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of host Src on host cell death during human or animal herpesvirus infections have never been reported, despite the fact that Src is considered to be both a survival factor (32, 33) and a death factor (33\u201335).",

ILTV infection significantly reduced the number of adherent cells that were negative for trypan blue staining by the third day postinfection (3 dpi), while cells in the control cultures continued to grow (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the reduction in the proportion of living cells following ILTV infection in our system (Fig. 1A), the proportion of apoptotic cells significantly increased from 2 dpi compared with that of control cells (Fig. 1B). The CPE of ILTV on LMH cells occurred by 2 dpi and became more severe as time progressed (Fig. 1C). In parallel with the induction of apoptosis and the occurrence of the CPE, the results of the qPCR assay showed that ILTV replicated exponentially in LMH cells from 2 dpi, whereas viral replication was not significant at 1 dpi compared with that at 0 dpi (Fig. 1C; the P values for replication at 1 and 2 dpi were 0.127 and 0.022, respectively). In addition, a concomitant, continuous increase in the copy number of the viral genome was observed in the medium from 2 dpi (Fig. 1C), which possibly explains the occurrence of the ILTV CPE at 2 dpi (Fig. 1C). The results of the qPCR assays were confirmed by TCID50 assays (Fig. 1D). No significant CPE was observed until 2 dpi, after which the virus titer increased continually in the cells and medium (Fig. 1D). The proportion of ILTV-infected cells was determined by FACS, and it was approximately 10% at 2 dpi but only about 1.5% at 1 dpi (Fig. 1E).",

The five functions from each subset showing the greatest differential gene expression are listed in Fig. 2C. Cellular component analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in those involved in the extracellular region and the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). Meanwhile, after ILTV infection the major biological processes controlled by genes that were differentially expressed were the regulation of cell proliferation, the enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway, skeletal system development, and embryonic organ development (Fig. 2C). The molecular functions of these differentially expressed genes appeared to be focused toward serine peptidase activity (Fig. 2C). Our GO analysis indicates that serine peptidase-based regulation of cell proliferation, the cytoskeleton system, and development through extra- and intracellular signal transduction may be the primary molecular events that occur in LMH cells upon ILTV infection.",

We sought to determine whether Src had any effect on ILTV-induced cell death using two strategies. First, the depletion of Src halted ILTV-induced Src phosphorylation at Tyr 416 (Fig. 3A), resulting in the promotion of the CPE (Fig. 3A). This effect was also evident in LMH cells that were pretreated with a well-characterized Src-specific chemical inhibitor, SU6656 (48) (Fig. 3B), which interrupts Src phosphorylation upon ILTV infection (Fig. 3B). FACS analysis of PI-stained cells found that ILTV infection in combination with the Src inhibitor resulted in levels of cell death at 2 dpi that were 4-fold higher than those in cells infected with ILTV alone (Fig. 3C). A further detailed analysis using annexin V-PI staining revealed a significant enhancement of necrosis and apoptosis in ILTV-infected cells upon either siRNA-mediated Src depletion or the administration of SU6656 (Fig. 3D and E), thereby demonstrating that inhibition of Src promoted LMH cell death during ILTV infection. The reduced threshold of ILTV-induced cell death by Src inhibition suggests that Src prolongs the survival of LMH cells in response to ILTV infection. Along with greater ILTV virulence, inhibition of host Src by either siRNA-mediated Src depletion or the administration of SU6656 resulted in >60% reductions in virus replication (Fig. 3F and G, right), as determined by qPCR when all virus-infected cells were dead (Fig. 3F and G, left).",

We first inoculated embryos with ILTV in combination with a serial dilution of the Src inhibitor SU6656. For the entire observation period (5 dpi), dead embryos were not observed at the lowest dose of SU6656 tested (25 \u03bcg). A dose of 50 \u03bcg of SU6656 resulted in the deaths of inoculated embryos by 2 dpi, with the mortality rate approaching 50% at 5 dpi (Fig. 4A). The highest dose of SU6656 (250 \u03bcg) resulted in the deaths of inoculated embryos by 1 dpi; all inoculated embryos were dead by 3 dpi (Fig. 4A). During the observation period, there were no embryo deaths in eggs treated with ILTV alone or in uninoculated eggs treated with the highest dose of SU6656 alone (Fig. 4A). Thus, the in ovo CPE that we observed was due to the combined effects of ILTV infection and SU6656 administration. Virus replication in allantoic fluids or CAMs was quantified by qPCR assays. Virus replication was reduced by SU6656 in a dose-dependent manner in allantoic fluids and CAMs (Fig. 4B and C).",

Immunoblotting results showed that the phosphorylation of Tyr 576/577 of FAK is enhanced by ILTV infection, although the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 and the total FAK levels were unaffected (Fig. 6A to C). In line with the essential role of the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 in the Src-mediated activation of integrin-focal adhesion signaling (26), the administration of a widely used FAK-specific chemical inhibitor, PF573228 (50), not only downregulated the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 and prevented the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 576/577 but also blocked the phosphorylation of Src at Tyr 416 in ILTV-infected LMH cells (Fig. 6A). These results support the involvement of FAK during ILTV infection and suggest that FAK activation is required for Src to regulate ILTV infection in LMH cells. Further immunoblotting results suggested that Src activity was indispensable for the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 576/577 during ILTV infection, because the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 576/577 during infection was prevented by pretreating the cells with either SU6656 (Fig. 6B) or specific siRNAs targeting Src (Fig. 6C). The total FAK level was not significantly affected by Src inhibition. Taken together, the findings presented above suggest that there is a positive-feedback loop between Src and FAK during ILTV infection. Additionally, the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 in LMH cells was also downregulated by SU6656 (Fig. 6B) or specific siRNAs targeting Src (Fig. 6C), indicating an essential role of basal Src activity in the maintenance of the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 in LMH cells.",

Histopathological examinations of slides with liver tissue stained with H&E showed more severe hepatic tissue necrosis in inoculated livers upon cotreatment with PF5732228 (with ILTV infection only, tissue necrosis was absent in four inoculated livers and mild in two; with ILTV infection and PF5732228 treatment, tissue necrosis was found to be mild in one inoculated liver, moderate in three inoculated livers, and severe in two inoculated livers) (Fig. 7F).

The underlying mechanisms governing ILTV-host interactions largely remain unclear, but they are important for developing novel strategies to control ILT. In the current study, we identified the Src-FAK interaction to be an essential determinant of ILTV-associated cell death in LMH cells. Based on our findings, we suggest a model where, upon ILTV infection, Src and FAK are phosphorylated and form a positive-feedback loop, thus subsequently reducing ILTV-induced host cell death but maintaining ILTV replication at high levels in host cells. However, in cells where either Src or FAK is inhibited, the phosphorylation of Src and FAK is disrupted, thereby disrupting the Src-FAK positive-feedback loop. This has the subsequent effect of enhancing the virulence of ILTV by making host cells more susceptible to ILTV-induced cell death, but it also limits ILTV replication. Furthermore, our in ovo studies revealed that Src inhibition induced death only in heavily infected embryos and not in embryos with mild infections, although significant reductions in the levels of viral replication were obtained in both cases (Fig. 5). We speculate that in chickens with minor ILTV infections, Src or FAK inhibition can help to quickly clear infected cells and delay disease progression, thereby limiting pathological damage. In turn, this might provide sufficient time for the activation of a host anti-ILTV immune response, thus improving the clearance of residual infected cells. However, in chickens heavily infected with ILTV, the inhibition of host Src or FAK could exacerbate the pathological effects and even increase the likelihood of death, although viral replication might still be repressed. Further investigations of the molecular basis of the regulation of ILTV replication and ILTV-induced cell death by the Src-FAK interaction are required to develop strategies that can improve ILT control and reduce economic losses during therapy.",

Considering that only 10% of cells were positive for ILTV-gI staining at this time point, the difference in the expression pattern between the Src transcript and protein may be due to delayed translation of the Src transcript. We cannot rule out the possibility that oscillation of the Src mRNA/protein level or any posttranscriptional mechanism delays or even compromises the translation of additional Src transcripts. Actually, the increase in the amount of Src protein caused by ILTV infection may not be absolutely required for Src to modulate ILTV infection, because the phosphorylation of Src at Try 416, which maintains Src in an active conformation, is highly induced after ILTV infection, regardless of the absolute level of Src protein.",

It is possible that Src-FAK cooperation has a similar effect on the cellular entry of ILTV. This assumption is based on the observation that the Src (51) and FAK (52) protein sequences are highly conserved (>95%) among humans, mice, and chickens. It has also been shown that HSV-1 VP11/12 can directly activate a host Src family kinase (53, 54), while glycoproteins B, G, and H can activate it indirectly (55, 56). Immunoprecipitation of the Src/FAK complex, followed by proteomic sequencing in LMH cells infected with ILTV, is needed to directly identify viral proteins that interact with Src/FAK. The ability of these candidate viral proteins to activate Src/FAK can be validated by infecting LMH cells using an ILTV harboring deletions in these genes. Further integrated, genome-wide high-throughput studies combined with a functional analysis of certain host factors may be helpful in exploring the mechanism by which ILTV hijacks host Src/FAK signaling in chicken cells.",

The phosphorylation of Src at Tyr 416 in turn promotes the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 576 and Tyr 577 (57\u201360). To uncover the interaction between Src and FAK activation in our chicken model, the phosphorylation of Src at Tyr 416 and all three related FAK tyrosine residues was detected in detail. Consistent with the prior knowledge of Src and FAK in humans and mice, the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 576 and Tyr 577 upon ILTV infection in our model was dependent on Src activation (Fig. 6B and C), and the phosphorylation of Src at Tyr 416 by ILTV infection also required the phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 6A). However, the contribution of the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 to Src activation by ILTV in LMH cells is still unclear, because FAK is constitutively phosphorylated at Tyr 397 and is unaffected by ILTV infection (Fig. 6A). The basal activity of Src is also essential for the maintenance of the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 (Fig. 6A). Further investigation of the basal level of phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397, as well as its contribution to Src activation by ILTV in chicken cells in which FAK Tyr 397 is mutated, is required to answer this question.",

Given that the key host determinant of ILTV infection in the tumor cell line LMH is a well-known oncogene, it was crucial to determine whether the host Src/FAK-mediated mechanism that we found in LMH cells is also present in normal cells, especially in vivo. Hence, we first examined the effect of an Src/FAK inhibitor on ILTV replication in SPF embryos and observed an effect similar to that caused by the Src/FAK inhibitor in LMH cells (Fig. 4 and 7). Furthermore, during the in ovo study, we examined the histopathology of the livers of ILTV-infected chicken embryos and assayed the amount of virus transmitted to the liver. All the results support the notion that, instead of a tumor cell line-specific event, the mechanism that we identified in LMH cells is universal in normal cells and tissues. In addition, we also analyzed the only publicly available, genome-wide gene expression data for chicken embryo lung cells infected with a different virulent ILTV strain at an MOI of 0.1 (18), which again revealed that host Src is the central regulator of the molecular network induced by ILTV infection in host cells (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).",

However, latent infections can still lead to outbreaks when the host immune system is compromised, such as under stress and at the onset of egg laying (13, 14, 61, 62). Therefore, novel strategies that are independent of host immunity are required to successfully control ILT. For example, the administration of therapeutic agents that target the key determinants and signaling pathways that govern the interaction between ILTV and the host at the onset of infection could reduce the extensive use of live virus-based vaccines. Here, we have uncovered a key determinant of avian ILTV infection, thereby advancing our understanding of the ILTV-host interaction. Our results also support the notion that manipulating the host molecular response can alter the biological outcomes of ILTV infection.",
