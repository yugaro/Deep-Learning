Oral supplementation with a bovine colostrum supplement in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\u2010associated diarrhea results in a dramatic decrease in stool evacuations per day, decrease in self\u2010estimated fatigue, and an increase in body weight.9 In contrast, supplementation with bovine colostrum in human patients with short bowel syndrome results in an increase in diarrhea with no improvement in intestinal absorption.10\n",

Thus, nonantibiotic alternatives for managing diarrhea in calves are an important management strategy in promoting judicious use of antibiotics, thereby minimizing antibiotic resistance. Given the reported benefits of bovine colostrum or immunoglobulin supplements in human and bovine studies and their potential use as nonantibiotic alternatives, investigations on their use for management of calf diarrhea are warranted. We hypothesized that oral supplementation with immunoglobulins in neonatal dairy calves with diarrhea will reduce treatment events, time to resolution of diarrhea, and mortality rates compared with placebo and control calves. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of oral immunoglobulin supplementation for 14 days on the number of treatment events, time to resolution of diarrhea, and mortality rates in preweaned dairy calves with diarrhea.",

The CONT group calves received no supplements in the milk, and the final total solids content of the milk after preparation ranged from 12 to 14% based on a digital refractometer reading (Palm Abbe PA203x, Misco, Cleveland, Ohio). The TRXT group calves were supplemented with 20 g of immunoglobulins delivered through 182 g of a bovine serum\u2010based colostrum supplement powder (Lifeline Protect, APC Inc, Boone, Iowa), mixed thoroughly with milk, twice daily for 14 days. Nutrients of the supplement fed to the TRXT group calves are summarized in Table 1. The PLCB group calves were supplemented with 182 g of a supplement powder of similar nutritional value as the TRXT group calves, but without the IgG (Lifeline Intervene, APC Inc, Boone, Iowa), mixed thoroughly with milk, twice daily for 14 days. Nutrients of the supplement fed to the PLCB group calves are summarized in Table 1. Thorough mixture of the supplement with milk was achieved by using an electric kitchen whisk. To avoid delaying of the feeding process of calves by the farm personnel, total solid concentrations were not measured after mixing the supplements with milk. To ensure accurate addition of the supplements and record keeping, nipple bottles for feeding enrolled calves were color coded with blue, black, and red colors using indelible markers representing the 3 groups. The colors on the nipple bottles were then matched with colors placed on individual calf hutches. The authors performed addition of supplements to the milk, mixing, and feeding of all enrolled calves. The farm personnel and the author (M.C.) who performed data analysis were blinded to the group assignments. Supplement addition to the milk for the TRXT and PLCB group calves were performed at the 6 am and 12 pm feedings. All 102 calves were enrolled within 5 days of commencement of the study. The study was performed from June 2018 to July 2018 and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC #19628).",

Our study results indicate that the anticipated benefits of conferring local gut immunity after supplementation with immunoglobulins in milk for calves with diarrhea were not evident. Addition of solid supplements to milk can affect its viscosity and palatability. The milk fed to the PLCB group was grossly different in color after addition of the supplement.

            "text": "Several reasons might explain the lack of effect on diarrhea after addition of immunoglobulins in milk in our study. We added 20 g of immunoglobulins per feeding (40 g per day) based on a previous study in calves which reported a reduction in frequency of occurrence of diarrheal disease in nonsick calves when 10 g of IgG was added twice daily to milk replacer.12 Considering that calves in our study had diarrhea, we estimated that supplementing with twice as much immunoglobulins compared to previous studies12 would likely produce an effect. The 20 g of immunoglobulins was delivered through 182 g of the powdered supplement, thereby adding solid weight to 2 L of milk. Any further addition of larger supplement weight to increase the amount of immunoglobulin will likely affect mixing, viscosity, and palatability of the milk leading to decrease in milk and immunoglobulin supplement consumption. Consequently, it is possible that the dose of immunoglobulins in our study was not sufficient to cause an effect when fed to calves with diarrhea. Furthermore, catabolism of immunoglobulins or passage of immunoglobulins through the gastrointestinal tract of calves with diarrhea might be higher than nondiarrheic calves, and thus higher doses of immunoglobulins are required to produce an effect. Effect of supplementation of immunoglobulins might also depend on the identity of the pathogens causing diarrhea. Studies in humans where oral bovine colostrum supplementation resulted in improvement or cessation of diarrhea were associated with management of Cryptosporidium\u2010associated diarrhea in HIV\u2010infected patients.9, 19, 20, 21, 22 Thus, it is possible that supplementation of oral immunoglobulin might be effective against specific pathogen classes (viral, bacterial, or protozoal) because of different mechanisms causing diarrhea. Diarrhea in calves is a complex disease syndrome characterized by coinfections with bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens, which might explain why the immunoglobulin supplementation was not effective as expected. Duration and severity of the diarrhea might also depend on the age of the calf, passive immune status of the calf, and the etiology of the diarrhea. Maldigestion and malabsorptive diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium or rotavirus causes loss of mature villous enterocytes resulting in mild to severe diarrhea of shorter clinical duration.23, 24, 25, 26 In contrast, maldigestion and malabsorptive diarrhea caused by coronavirus causes loss of mature and crypt enterocytes of the small intestine and colon resulting in prolonged duration of clinical signs.27, 28 Furthermore, osmotic diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli because of production of K99 and heat stable toxin commonly occurs during the first 4 days of life and rarely leads to diarrhea in adult cattle.29, 30, 31 We did not identify the pathogens causing diarrhea in our study because of the lack of licensure required to import calf\u2010side tests for testing bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens in calves with diarrhea. Furthermore, we did not determine the fecal immunoglobulin concentration to assess metabolism of the ingested immunoglobulins. Results of studies in human patients with active or benign inflammatory bowel diseases,32 calves with diarrhea,33 and clinically healthy dogs34 suggested that fecal immunoglobulin determinations tests were less reliable because of lower detection rates (<0.01 to 35.5%). It was likely that measuring fecal immunoglobulin concentrations in our study would have been unrewarding.",

Serum derived immunoglobulin supplements contain higher IgG2 concentrations than IgG1 because bovine serum contains higher IgG2 concentrations.35 In contrast, bovine colostrum\u2010derived immunoglobulin supplements contain higher IgG1 concentrations than IgG2 because IgG1 is selectively secreted from the cow's circulation into colostrum.36 Although IgG1 is considered the principal immunoglobulin for passive immunization (requiring absorption from the gut), our study assessed local immunity by the immunoglobulins. Although previous reviews indicated that only IgG1 activates complement,35 other studies indicated that both bovine IgG1 and IgG2 activate complement and mediate phagocytosis.36 Potentially, response of calves with diarrhea to supplementation with bovine serum\u2010derived immunoglobulin might differ from bovine colostrum\u2010derived immunoglobulin.",

Although unlikely to influence the results, the difference in crude protein, ash, and vitamins between the TRXT and PLCB supplements could not be adjusted easily by dilution without delaying feeding of nonenrolled calves by the farm personnel. Thus, no attempt was made to adjust the difference in the crude protein, ash, or vitamins at the time of feeding. Although it is likely practical to add supplements to milk or milk replacers in clinic settings or for individual calves in small dairy herds, it is important to note that this might not be time efficient on a large dairy farm. Although in our study there was no additional time required for feeding the calves because the authors added the supplements and fed all the enrolled calves, additional labor by farm personnel might be required for addition of supplements to individual calves with diarrhea on a large dairy farm. We did not consider dehydration status or acid\u2010base assessments using serum biochemical analysis or base deficit prediction charts based on body position, strength of the suckle reflex, and age37 of the calf in our study. Although group assignment of calves was randomized, and only calves with uncomplicated diarrhea were enrolled, and medical treatments were included as a covariate for time to resolution of diarrhea in the data analysis, acid\u2010base status of the calves might affect medical treatments and response to treatment. The increase in osmolarity after adding the supplement might exacerbate the diarrhea or affect viscosity and palatability. We did not assess the change in osmolarity after the addition of the supplements for each feeding as this would have decreased the efficiency of the feeding process by farm personnel. The supplement fed to the PLCB group calves contained potassium, whereas the TRXT group supplement contained no potassium. Although we did not determine the plasma potassium concentrations in our study, calves with diarrhea are frequently normokalemic or hyperkalemic in the presence of acidemia38, 39 despite potential intestinal losses or decreased milk consumption.40 Thus, hypokalemia is infrequently observed in calves with diarrhea.38, 39 Supplementation of potassium in hyperkalemic calves with diarrhea might cause severe cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrythmias,41 thereby negatively affecting recovery of calves from diarrhea.",
