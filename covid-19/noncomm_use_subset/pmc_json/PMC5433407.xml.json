In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy.2 In 2007 the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study Group proposed a consensus definition for ADEM for application in research and clinical settings.3 The pathogenesis of ADEM is not fully known, but adhesion molecules, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and other cell factors can play important roles in its occurrence and development.4",

The probability of having an abnormal reaction such as ADEM to vaccines is small, but the occurrences of such reactions increased after the EPI, causing widespread public concern. This may reduce public confidence in vaccines. When evaluating the risk of vaccines leading to ADEM or when judging whether ADEM has a causal association with vaccination, epidemiological features and population-level baseline incidence rates, in addition to clinical characteristics and disease diagnosis, must be assessed. A firm measure of the incidence of ADEM is increasingly important.",

            "text": "Reportedly, ADEM can occur at any age, with higher frequency in children than adults. Predominant age of occurrence in children is 5\u20138 years,6,14\u201317 or mainly in children and young people.18 Pohl et al. reported that the incidence rate of ADEM was 0.09/100,000/year among children less than 10 years old and 0.03/100,000/year among children 10\u201315 years old in Germany.9 In Canada, children with ADEM were more likely to be younger than 10 years.19 Previous studies on ADEM have focused on children but rarely on adults. Our study found that the highest incidence rate was among individuals 0\u20139 years old (0.77/100,000/year), and the incidence decreased with the increase of age among people less than 50 years old. But the incidence increased among people 50\u201359 years old (0.45/100,000/year), followed by individuals 60\u201369 years old (0.43/100,000/year). Senile ADEM, which attracts much of our attention, has rarely been reported.20 It is probably due to: (1) differences between the elderly and young people in susceptibility or immune response to infectious agents, and (2) lack of sensitive tools to examine patients before the widespread use of MRI.21",

This frequency distribution has also been observed by others.15,23 A male-to-female incidence ratio that changes with advanced age may suggest differential referral, detection, or access to a neurologist.

ADEM is thought to be triggered by a nonspecific preceding infection in more than 70% of cases.14,22,23 A number of infectious agents, such as influenza, rubella, measles, mumps, herpes, varicella, simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis viruses, coxsackieviruses, legionella, mycoplasma, Campylobacter, streptococcus, and rickettsia, have been implicated in ADEM.23 The lack of obvious seasonal variation in incidence may be because the infections found most frequently to trigger this disease occur in different seasons around the globe.",
