            "text": "Toxigenic Escherichia coli have been recognized as the most important cause of diarrhea in both human and animals in developing countries (Bouzari et al., 2007). Worldwide, E. coli diarrhea is still a persistent problem with significant economic and potential public health impact. Poor management and environmental factors enhance their interaction with their hosts causing dramatic illness and loss in neonatal animals. The present study was designed to screen for and characterize pathogenic E. coli with special reference to the hybrid strains in apparently healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves and evaluate their clinical and hematobiochemical changes. ETEC causes serious diarrhea in neonatal calves. Furthermore ETEC and shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) have been incriminated in foodborne infections in humans. These two pathogroups are defined based on the pathogroup-associated virulence genes: stx encoding Shiga toxin for STEC and sta encoding heat-stable enterotoxin and/or elt encoding heat-labile for ETEC. The study looked into the toxin genes of serologically typed pathogenic E. coli. Along with the common pathogroups of E. coli, EPEC and EHEC, STEC/ETEC hybrid strains were detected. STEC and other diarrheogenic E. coli are able to acquire virulence genes via horizontal gene transfer from other pathogroups leading to the development of divergent pathogroups (M\u00fcller et al., 2007; Johura et al., 2016). Such divergent pathogroups are often assigned using different terminology such as \u201chybrid\u201d \u201cblended virulence profiles\u201d and \u201cvirulence combination\u201d (Bielaszewska et al., 2011; Mellmann et al., 2011; Johura et al., 2016). The coexisting STEC-and ETEC associated virulence genes in E. coli strains of human, animal, and environmental origins has been reported in in Germany, United States and Slovakia (Vu-Khac et al., 2007; Fratamico et al., 2008; Prager et al., 2011), some of which have been associated with human disease (Prager et al., 2011). Previous studies have identified STEC/ETEC hybrid strains from patients and animals in Finland (Martikainen et al., 2012) and from animal derived food in Burkina Faso (Nyholm et al., 2015a). Comparative genomics and characterization study of such strains has been conducted by Nyholm et al. (2015b) to determine their phylogenetic position among E. coli and to define the virulence genes they harbor.",

Other studies have demonstrated the experimental addition or subtraction of many features in a base model E. coli strain, enabling these modified strains to cause disease in their host (Kaper et al., 2004). The current study demonstrated the presence of STEC\u2013ETEC hybrid among E. coli isolates and strongly suggested that this strain might contribute in the diarrhea in neonatal calves and pose a potential public health threat in Egypt.",

Heart rate was variable in diarrheic neonatal calves.

Relative hyperprotenamia was a constant finding in neonatal calf diarrhea and there was a direct relationship between the severity of dehydration and the concentration of total plasma protein. This finding could be attributed to body fluids losses. No change in the blood glucose level was observed in mild cases of neonatal calf diarrhea. This could be attributed to the ability of calves to maintain their suckling affinity. On the other hand, there was significant hypoglycemia in moderate and severe cases of calf diarrhea. This could be attributed to weak or absence of normal suckling affinity, altered intestinal epithelial transport and developing endotoxic-septic shock (Naylor, 2002).",
