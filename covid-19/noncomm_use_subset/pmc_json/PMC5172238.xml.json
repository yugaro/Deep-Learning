Here we only show the comparison result with coronaviruses since the distances with non-coronavirus are very large. To present the similarity of the MFP between the SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses more clearly, we use the chaos game representation (CGR) to demonstrate the results. Only one isolate is selected to represent its species because the MFP of different isolates within the same species is very similar. To find whether there is a relationship between the viruses and their hosts, we also demonstrate the MFP of Homo Sapiens (host of the SARS-CoV) and Mus Musculus (host of the MHV).",

BJ01, MHV and PEDV (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus) have another similar characteristic of the high frequency of TG. The obvious difference between BJ01 and other coronaviruses is that the AA frequency of BJ01 is higher. This AA-rich characteristic is the same to Homo Sapiens, so probably in SARS-CoV it is influenced by its host\u2014Homo Sapiens. The result that the MFPs of Homo Sapiens and mouse are very similar to each other is in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis. The lower frequency of CG in all the images could be easily explained by the reason that there is a relatively high chance of a methyl-C mutation into a T. Theoretically, the C-T methyl mutation should induce the frequency increase of TG, while the result shows that the frequency of TG is not high in about six organisms out of the eight. So there should be some other mechanisms that lead to the decrease of TG in these organisms.",

We found out that at motif length 4, almost all the tetranucleotide of coronaviruses with the highest frequency are TGTT except those in SARS-CoV (Figure 5). The richest tetranucleotide of the SARS-CoV is TGCT, while TGTT is the second. This fact demonstrates that the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically far from other coronaviruses, and this conclusion is the same as the serological analysis result. To see whether this characteristic is unique to coronaviruses, we searched 2,497 virus genomes, and found only two viruses, Beet soil-borne mosaic virus (genome size: 4,616 bp; NCBI accession number: AF061869) and Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (genome size: 3,683 bp; NCBI accession number: AJ132577), have this characteristic. Both these two exceptions are ssRNA positively stranded viruses and belong to two different subspecies: Furovirus and Benyvirus. We computed the TGTT content of coronavirus genomes and the result is shown in Table 1. As a comparison, the contents of other viruses have also been computed, but the results are not listed here. The lowest content is 0.13% appeared in TT-like mini virus (NCBI accession number: AF291073), and the highest content is 7.33% in HCoV-229. The difference of TGTT frequency between different viruses is great. Nothing significant is found at other motif lengths. Thus the richest tetranucleotide, TGTT, could be a common characteristic of coronaviruses.",

Astonishingly, some viruses that do not belong to coronavirus also have the same difference with the SARS-CoV, such as human papillomavirus (NCBI accession number: U85660).
