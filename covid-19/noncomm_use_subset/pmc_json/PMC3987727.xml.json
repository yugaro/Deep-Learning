            "text": "National and international guidelines for the management of acute asthma recommend: (1) inhaled \u03b22-agonists for all patients; (2) systemic (usually oral) corticosteroids for those with moderate and severe asthma; and (3) repeated doses of inhaled \u03b22-agonists and anticholinergics for severe cases.6\n7\n9\n10 The latter two recommendations independently reduce admission rates by 25% in studies of predominantly school-aged children.11\n12 Several features must be noted. First, recommendations are severity-specific; patients with mild asthma do not appear to benefit from oral corticosteroids.11\n13 Second, the concept of the \u2018golden first hour of treatment\u2019 supports early and aggressive asthma management, as the risk of admission is reduced only when oral corticosteroids are administered 3\u20134 h prior to the decision to admit. Third, of all treatments administered in the ED, oral corticosteroids are by far the most effective for preventing admission.14 Fourth, there is no equally effective substitute for oral corticosteroids; promising contenders such as high-dose inhaled steroids,15\n16 intravenous antileukotrienes17 or magnesium sulfate18 have been shown to be inferior to oral corticosteroids and are used as an add-on therapy. Fifth, systemic corticosteroids are inexpensive generic drugs. Short treatment with oral corticosteroids is generally devoid of significant side effects,19 though rare cases of fatal or disseminated varicella have been reported.20 Sixth, while recommendations are relatively similar in young children, older children and adults, the evidence for the former is weaker due to the under-representation of preschool-aged children in relevant trials.11\n12 While oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management of acute, moderate or severe asthma,6 several reports have recently shaken the belief that they are equally effective for all patients with asthma, showing that children with viral-induced wheezing21 and smoking adults22 are corticosteroid-resistant. Indeed, in a large placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial of 700 children aged 10\u201360 months with mild-to-moderate viral-induced wheezing, oral corticosteroid was not superior to placebo for reducing the length of stay in hospital or improving the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) clinical score, despite adequate study power.21 Critics have suggested that: (1) in most children, the disease may not have been asthma (documented in only 16% of patients) but rather the North American definition of bronchiolitis; (2) some patients (with mild asthma) may not have needed corticosteroids23; (3) the prolonged stay in hospital did not seem to be supported by severity24 and (4) the dose of 1 (instead of 2) mg/kg may have been insufficient. Yet, this study elicited major discomfort regarding acute asthma management in young children.24 In another adequately powered landmark trial, a 2-week treatment with prednisone showed a marked blunting of response in adult smokers, with an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 237 mL (95% CI 43 to 431) in never-smokers compared to no change or 47 (\u2212148 to 243) mL in current smokers.22 The question remains as to whether smoking adolescents and children with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) respond as well as those not exposed. None of these aforementioned findings have been replicated, thus prompting us to review the potential determinants of responsiveness.",

Asthma, defined as airway obstruction (cough, dyspnoea and wheezing) with hyper-reactivity and reversibility with bronchodilator or corticosteroids, begins early in life.29\n30 While children and adults meeting these criteria can be diagnosed at the first episode, generally three wheezing episodes are required for children \u226412 months to reduce the risk of misclassification with bronchiolitis.8\n31 Heterogeneous groups of children with bronchiolitis and asthma may explain the poor response to oral corticosteroids in studies including infants and toddlers.21\n24 Thus, an operational definition of asthma, clinically applicable to children aged 1\u201317 years, is needed to reasonably exclude bronchiolitis.",

Moreover, response may be organism specific, a hypothesis that requires careful documentation of aetiology.",

Heavier ETS exposure in preschoolers who spend more time at home than school-aged children46\n47 may explain a poorer response in young children. Objective documentation of smoking would also be important if possible, even before high school where many already smoke.48 Of particular concern is whether a blunted response to oral corticosteroids would be found in children exposed to tobacco smoke and adolescents with a short history of active smoking. With 25% of asthmatic children exposed to ETS and 25% of teenagers actively smoking,49\u201351 such an assessment appears critical.",

In the first group, we selected eight polymorphisms in seven genes that can be divided into those coding for xenobiotic metabolising enzymes and those coding for mediators of inflammation and immunity, specifically the ones demonstrated to affect lung function, disease severity and interaction with exposure to ETS.67\n68 We selected polymorphisms affecting gene function, top-ranking single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of associated studies. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 polymorphisms were found to correlate with disease severity69; CC16 polymorphisms play a role in the development and persistence of the asthma phenotype in childhood70; CD14 polymorphisms have been linked to pathogenesis of asthma and lung function in smokers.71 The ORMDL3 gene confers susceptibility to early-onset asthma, particularly through interaction with early life exposure to ETS67\n72; GSTM1 and GSTP1 are involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives and reactive oxygen species73\n74; GSTM1 null and GSTP1 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of asthma75 and rapid decline of lung function among smokers.76 The ADRB2 receptor gene was found to contribute to the occurrence of wheeze among children who were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero and in early childhood77 and was related to \u03b22-agonist response.68\n78 Among genes affecting the corticosteroid and inflammatory pathways, we selected genes (CHRH1, TBX21, FCER2, GLCC1, STIP1 and SERPINE1) that were shown to correlate with response to corticosteroids in patients with asthma; the finding for some of them was replicated in several cohorts.79\u201384 All selected polymorphisms with the gene name, position and corresponding reference are summarised in table 1. Genotyping is essential to link the observed corticosteroid response to genotype and to evaluate the potential host\u2013environment interaction.",

Sputum eosinophils and ECP increase with exposure to allergens and decrease with corticosteroid treatment.86 A higher proportion of neutrophils is associated with smoking22\n44\n87 and with viral infection.39\n88 The non-eosinophilic inflammatory phenotype in adults has been associated with poor response to corticosteroids.89\n90 Markers of this phenotype include an increased proportion of neutrophils, IL-8 and myeloperoxidase, all of which are easily quantifiable.91\n92 Contrary to adult findings and criteria, three distinct inflammatory cell patterns have been reported during paediatric exacerbations: non-eosinophilic (<2.5% eosinophils) in 22%, eosinophilic (\u22652.5% eosinophils) in 43% and combined eosinophilic/neutrophilic (\u22652.5% eosinophils and >54% neutrophils) in 35%, with paucigranular inflammation not described in acute paediatric asthma.62 Combined eosinophilic/neutrophilic exacerbations show more mast cells and higher sputum ECP levels than eosinophilic exacerbations.

Moreover, incorporating return visits resulting in admission provides an additional measure of failure of ED treatment by adding a measure of the decision appropriateness. Time to meet severity criteria for discharge (PRAM <4) and length of active treatment are two additional measures of interest that are less influenced by factors other than severity.",

As some inclusion and exclusion criteria may become evident during or after the ED stay (ie, pneumonia), a central adjudicating committee comprising a paediatrician/ED physician and respirologist will review the eligibility criteria of children who, after enrolment, appear to be ineligible due to the failure to meet one or more inclusion or exclusion criteria and who did not receive or tolerate oral corticosteroids as recommended in the protocol. The main trigger for identifying these children will be the ED physician's low degree of confidence that this child had asthma, suspicion that he/she may have bronchiolitis and the suspicion that he/she did not retain the oral corticosteroids. In this case, the relevant case report forms, relevant anonymised laboratory testing (ie, imaging, microbiology, virology and haematology) and relevant anonymised medical chart sections will be reviewed by the adjudicating committee. The adjudicating committee will be central, although we are not ruling out the possibility of creating local committees at each site, depending on the volume of cases to review. In such a case, the site would be added as a covariate in the analysis. Disagreement will be resolved by consensus or the assistance of a third observer. The proportion of excluded children, assumed to be around 10%, will be monitored and reported.",

Pilot data were extracted from two large recent chart audits14\n138 totalling 1628 children presenting with acute asthma to the ED (in which age, gender, baseline PRAM, timing of oral corticosteroid intake and admission were documented) and two recently completed trials119\n139 totalling 518 children, in whom tobacco exposure was also ascertained by questionnaire; we then focused only on children meeting our current eligibility criteria (age, baseline PRAM and corticosteroids within an hour of arrival). Based on the literature, we assumed the prevalence of viral pathogen varied between 60% and 80%.140\n141 The baseline risk of admission was 41%; after recruitment of the initial 320 patients, the observed overall risk of admission was substantially lower at 16%, which substantially reduced the effective sample size from 1200 to 800. First, using the Wald test (based on the prevalence of factors and the risk of admission in unexposed children), we calculated the sample size required to detect an RD of admission of 7.5%, taking each determinant in turn as the independent variable in a bivariate logistic regression; we used 95% CIs for each estimate obtained from pilot data to examine the impact on power.142 Then, using the method proposed by Hsieh et al,143 we calculated the inflation factor to adjust the total sample size, based on the observed correlation between key determinants (age, gender and tobacco exposure, and baseline severity). As the observed correlation between determinants and severity and any pair of determinants was negligible (\u03b2 coefficients <0.03), there was no need to inflate the sample size. At an \u03b1 of 0.05, a sample of 800 children had 80% power to detect an RD of admission of \u22657.5% for all key determinants. We targeted the RD of 7.5%, because it was considered in a survey of researchers of the Pediatric Emergency Research in Canada (PERC) network as a clinically meaningful effect size that would support a practice change. After documenting a 1% loss after enrolment (from 10% originally estimated) and 20% missing key samples (viral or cotinine), our target recruitment sample is 1008 to obtain an effective sample of 800 children. Acknowledging that the majority of selected polymorphisms have a minor allele frequency of at least 30% and using an \u03b1 of 0.005 (with a Bonferroni correction for 14 polymorphisms), 1008 children will provide 80% power to detect an OR of 1.5 between each polymorphism and admission. Finally, of the expected 400 children recruited at the University Health Centre Sainte-Justine, we estimated that 200 children would cooperate with eNO measurements and 60 with induced sputum. These sample sizes should be adequate to detect a correlation coefficient as low as 0.2\u20130.35, respectively, with the area under the curve of the PRAM score during the ED with 80% power and a two-sided 0.05 \u03b1.",

All parents will sign an informed consent form authorising the DNA analysis for the specified research purpose as well as future analyses (including biobanking of DNA in anonymised fashion), provided these are approved by the institutional ethics boards. Assent will be obtained from children aged \u22657 years. The collection of saliva by expectoration or sponge is painless and well tolerated by children. Nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab for viral diagnosis is a commonly used procedure in the ED setting; it is rapid and associated with little discomfort. The performance of Rrs and eNO is non-invasive and devoid of serious side effects. Sputum induction with 0.9% saline and salbutamol pretreatment is a safe procedure in the acute care setting.134\u2013136 Data safety is maximised through: restricted physical access to computers and electronically protected servers (firewall, restricted password-protected access, daily back-up and storage in 2 different locations). Confidentiality is also a part of standard operating procedures; a unique research code will be assigned to each patient. All research data and specimens will be kept in locked rooms with restricted access at each site, the coordination centre and the site of analysis.

Given the high prevalence of suspected factors (young age (60%), viral infection (60\u201380%), ETS (20\u201330%)), the potential impact of poor response on the rate of failure of ED management is sizeable. The exploration of potential host\u2013environment interactions will broaden our understanding of corticosteroid responsiveness in children and enable us to focus on relevant alternative/supplemental strategies to adequately manage these patients.
