Concern over escape from a laboratory of a deadly human-contagious virus (e.g., influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] viruses) prompted the U.S. Government to hold back funding for this research \u201cuntil a robust and broad deliberative process (2) is completed that results in the adoption of a new USG gain-of-function research policy.\u201d This discussion is now under way in the United States and is to be completed in 2016.",

            "text": "In relation to this discussion, mBio published three letters to the editor in a debate between Dr. Ron Fouchier and me. Defending the safety of his work in the first letter (3), Dr. Fouchier calculated that it would likely take more than a million years for an escape from his lab through a laboratory-acquired infection (LAI). Intuitively, this million-year claim seems dubious. I questioned the equation used in the Fouchier calculation and the extremely low probability of escape that he employed in the calculation, and I outlined an alternative approach (4). Fouchier\u2019s response to my comments was then published in mBio (5). It is clear that he did not understand my methodology.\nIn calculations of the probability of a community LAI (\u201cE\u201d), Dr. Klotz further assumes that transmission studies in the Erasmus MC facility will be performed for a period (\u201cy\u201d) of 1 million years. I am hopeful that our research enterprise will have reached solid conclusions on determinants of airborne transmission a bit sooner.\nRhetorical quip aside, neither his million-year result nor my questioning of it implies or assumes in any way that research must be performed for a given number of years. My questioning and my alternative approach were simply a comment on his approach. Elsewhere in my comments (4), I assumed that the research enterprise will be concluded in 10 years, as does he.",

This probability is likely higher than that for LAIs in BSL3 labs that have extra biosafety precautions in place (called BSL3+), such as Fouchier claims for his lab. The probability (P1 = 0.0001) is 20 times lower and is an estimate for differences between BSL3 and BSL3+ labs. The final probability (P1 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126) is Fouchier\u2019s estimate (3). To make his estimate, Fouchier itemizes the various safety measures in his lab and generously reduces the probability for each safety measure but admits that it is a guess: \u201cthe magnitude of this increase in safety is not known.\u201d Finally, the discussion here of probabilities has been restricted to LAIs, but there are other routes of escape, such as mechanical failure and removal of live virus from BSL3+ containment accidentally or for hostile purposes.",

The conclusion there was that each lab in the enterprise would carry the potential burden of over 14 fatalities per year. \u201cTo put this fatality burden number in perspective, no Institutional Review Board tasked with assessing human subject research would approve a proposed research project with 14 potential fatalities per year.\u201d",

I defined it as research on potential pandemic pathogens with NIH funding (influenza and SARS category pathogens) and labs otherwise funded. He defines it as only influenza virus research. I implied that the whole research enterprise includes the other pathogens by picking the number 30, doubling the NIH\u2019s 15 projects subject to the pause.

Dr. Fouchier writes (5)\nAnother key aspect is that Dr. Klotz estimates the likelihood of onward transmission from a case of LAI as 0.1 (10%), in contrast to my justification for an adjusted likelihood of <1 \u00d7 10\u20135, based on the specific conditions under which the research is performed, without providing a rationale for that important deviation.\nI certainly do provide a rationale for the 10% likelihood of LAI (4) through references 8 and 9 (risk assessment studies).\nSummarizing the literature, Lipsitch and Inglesby estimate the probability that a community LAI leads to a global spread (pandemic) to be 5 to 60%. This range is consistent with the 5 to 15% range found by Merler and coworkers (8) and with the 1 to 30% range found in a focused risk assessment (9) for infection spread beginning on crowded public transportation.\nFurthermore, there is a rather arcane subject in probability, branching theory, which allows prediction of the likelihood of uncontrolled spread of any pathogen based on its observed reproductive number (Ro) value and the variance to mean of the Ro. A large variance to mean could occur due to superspreaders, for instance, some people infected with SARS virus. For a wide range of Ro values, Lipsitch and coworkers have calculated the probability of uncontrolled spread (see Fig. 4a in their study [9]). For a single infected individual with an Ro of 2, the probability of an uncontrolled outbreak ranges from 10% (spread of Ros) to 80% (uniform Ro).",

These numbers not only ignore the scientifically justifiable counterarguments raised before (2) but also are at odds with the documented influenza pandemics of the past. In my view, the \u201cgain-of-function\u201d debate has suffered from the apocalyptic scenarios that are provided as factual whereas they provide estimates that are far beyond the observed worst cases (8).\nIt is estimated that the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infected 20% of the world\u2019s population. The 1918 H1N1 \u201cSpanish\u201d flu killed perhaps 2% of its victims. The H5N1 avian influenza virus, the subject of Fouchier\u2019s research, kills about 50% of those who are infected through direct contact with poultry. The scenario I use as an example represents a combination of these three real events. While this scenario has not yet and may never occur in nature, it is a possible scenario perhaps more likely from a laboratory escape.",
