            "text": "Between February and May 2013, the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was associated with 132 human cases, including 37 deaths, occurring mainly in Eastern China (1). Most reports of infection have presented a severe clinical picture characterized by bilateral pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with a cytokine storm and multiorgan failure (2, 3). This clinical presentation is similar to that with H5N1 infection (2, 3) but is unusual for H7 viruses, which cause mostly mild respiratory illness or conjunctivitis (4). The hospitalized case fatality rate for H7N9 is estimated at 36% (5), compared to 60 to 70% for H5N1 (6, 7) and 6.5 to 8% for seasonal influenza infection (8, 9). However, mild cases of H7N9 infections were recently detected through sentinel influenza-like illness surveillance, suggesting that H7N9 could have caused a substantial number of asymptomatic to moderate infections (5, 10). This is in line with infections by most influenza virus strains, with the exception of H5N1, for which there is no report of a laboratory-confirmed mild case of infection. Other epidemiological differences between H7N9 and H5N1 include the more rapid accumulation of human infections with H7N9 than with H5N1 and differences in the age distribution of infected individuals, with H5N1 infections occurring mostly in children and young adults while 55% of H7N9 cases have been in individuals older than 60 years (7).",

            "text": "Sequence analysis indicates that H7N9 originated from multiple reassortment events between avian influenza viruses (11, 12). However, the H7N9 sequence bears several genetic markers of human adaptation, including PB2 E627K and hemagglutinin (HA) Q226L (11, 13). The consequence of these mutations for the host response has not been assessed. Previous studies of H7N9 virus-host interaction have focused on transmissibility and HA binding properties. The H7N9 strain A/Anhui/01/13 (Anhui01) has a mixed \u03b12-3/\u03b12-6 receptor preference, associated with a capacity to efficiently transmit by direct contact but poorly by respiratory droplets in the ferret model (14). These properties are intermediary between human seasonal influenza viruses that have an \u03b12-6 preference and efficiently transmit by respiratory droplets and H5N1 viruses with an \u03b12-3 preference that do not transmit efficiently in either respiratory droplet or direct-contact transmission models (14, 15). Crystallographic structures of HA from H7N9 strains isolated from human patients show that increased avidity for human receptors compared to that of avian H7 virus is due to the Q226L and G186V mutations (16). Assays of HA binding to human tissue sections revealed an intermediate binding pattern between human IAV (preferentially binding nonciliated cells of apical regions of the trachea) and H5N1 (binding alveolar sections). In addition, a single mutation, G228S, substantially increased HA binding to human receptors in the human respiratory tract (17).",

We show that H7N9 induces both a specific response and responses intermediate between those to H3N2 and those to avian H5N1 and H7N7. Notably, H7N9 induced a downregulation of the antigen presentation pathway and delayed proinflammatory cytokine induction to a greater extent than H5N1 and H7N7, which could have an important impact on in vivo immune responses. Similar to H3N2, H7N9 induced minor changes in eicosanoid signaling and genes implicated in chromatin modification. Finally, we computationally predicted that several FDA-approved drugs were able to reverse the host response to H7N9 and may be antivirals against this emerging virus. One of these drugs, minocycline, exhibited anti-H7N9 activity in vitro.",

Here, polarized confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells were infected apically with the avian-origin IAVs A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) (Anhui01), A/Netherland/219/2003 (H7N7) (NL219), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (VN1203), or a human seasonal virus, A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) (Pan99) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Viral replication was assessed at 3, 7, 12, and 24 h postinoculation [hpi] by standard plaque assays.

            "text": "To assess the whole transcriptomic cellular response to IAV infection, we used several metrics (Fig. 2). First, multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to visualize Euclidian distances between each transcriptomic profile in two dimensions (Fig. 2A). In this plot, each sample is represented by a dot; samples with similar transcriptomic profiles (i.e., a small Euclidian distance) are close together, while increasing distance is relative to increasing transcriptomic dissimilarity. We observed that samples clustered by time point and viral treatment, indicating a good agreement between biological replicates. At 3 and 7 hpi, IAV-infected samples were very similar to mock-infected ones (mocks), suggesting few transcriptomic changes early after infection, while the distance from mocks increased at 12 and 24 hpi. At 24 hpi, each viral condition was in a distinct location, indicating a specific response to each IAV. However, while avian H5N1 and H7N7 samples were relatively close together, H7N9 samples were located relatively far from each of the other IAVs, indicating a specific host response to this virus. To determine whether the host response to H7N9 infection was closer to the avian or human IAV response, we measured the transcriptomic distance between Anhui01-infected and other IAV-infected samples at each time point (Fig. 2B). At 12 hpi, H7N9 was significantly closer to both H7N7 and H5N1 than to H3N2. Surprisingly, at 24 hpi, the shortest distance was between H7N9 and H3N2, while the largest distance was between H7N9 and H7N7, indicating that responses to H7N7 and H7N9 were the most distinct. Of note, the response to H7N9 infection was as different from that of mock samples as that to avian IAV at 24 hpi, suggesting very specific response to H7N9 infection. Finally, to determine transcriptomic distances between all IAV- and mock-infected samples at each time point, we used hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2C). This analysis confirmed that H3N2 induced the largest host response early after infection and that at 24 hpi, responses to H7N7 and H5N1 were the most similar, while the response to H7N9 was closer to that to H3N2.",

Regulation of transcription and the cell cycle by H7N9 could be related to specific interactions between H7N9 proteins and nuclear factors. Among the genes significantly upregulated by all IAVs except H7N9 (cluster 2) were several interferon (IFN) type 1 genes (IFN-A10, IFN-A16, IFN-A21, and IFNw1), IL-27, IL-32, and IL-12A (see Fig. S4A).

Several receptors of eicosanoids (LTB4R, TBXA2R, and PTGER3) were also more increased by H5N1 and H7N7 than by H7N9 or H3N2 IAVs. Forty-seven genes from cluster 20 were involved in chromatin modification, with the majority of genes involved in this biological process having similar profiles between H7N9 and H3N2 versus H5N1 and H7N7, but some genes were specifically upregulated only in H7N9-infected samples (cluster 9 and 13 genes) (see Fig. S5).

To evaluate potential antiviral effect of minocycline, polarized Calu-3 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of minocycline for 3 h and infected with Anhui01 at an MOI of 0.01 (Fig. 5). At 24 hpi, there was a significant decrease of 1.3 log10 (17%) of Anhui01 viral titers in cells treated with 200 \u00b5M minocycline (P < 0.01). Lower concentrations of minocycline did not inhibit Anhui01 viral replication. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug with in vitro activity against both DNA and RNA viruses, was used as a positive control and induced a more robust decrease of 5.3 log10 (71%) of the log10 viral titer (Fig. 5).

Other avian IAVs, such as H5N1, indeed have a seasonal pattern, with an increase in human infection during the winter. In addition, H7N9 is likely still circulating in poultry. Several studies have shown that H7N9 possess genetic markers associated with adaptation to humans, allowing higher replication in mammal cells (PB2 E627K) and increased binding of \u03b12-6 human receptors (HA Q226L and G186V). Further adaptation of H7N9 to humans is of concern, since it could lead to efficient human-to-human transmission. In this study, we have shown that cell responses to H7N9 infection are more similar to those to H3N2 infection than to those to infection with avian H5N1 or H7N7 viruses, which implies that H7N9 has adapted to the human host. Some of the human IAV-like transcriptomic responses of H7N9 were related to similar lower induction of several genes involved in the eicosanoid pathway. Some lipid mediators from these pathways were recently identified as correlates of the pathogenic or resolution phase of IAV infection in mice (26) and had antiviral effect in cells and mice (27). Our analysis revealed that the eicosanoid pathway is differentially regulated by avian and human IAVs, with a potential impact on lung inflammation and viral replication.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, the most distinct response was between H7N9 and H7N7, despite genetic similarities between HA segments. Therefore, analysis of viral sequences alone cannot predict the host response to infection. Analysis between HA and human receptors has revealed that H7N9 has a profile intermediate between those of human and avian IAVs. Here, we observed that the host response to H7N9 shared some similarities with the response to human and avian IAVs, but we also observed a large amount of specificity in the cell response to H7N9 infection. Genes significantly induced by H7N9 were involved in cell cycle regulation, transcription, and epigenetic modifications. Consistent with findings of a previous study in polarized Calu-3 cells (19), we noted that avian IAVs induced a weaker proinflammatory cytokine response than human IAV. For genes coding for type I IFN and some other cytokines, this reduced cytokine induction was even more striking in H7N9-infected than in H5N1- or H7N7-infected samples. The ability to delay the antiviral host response could also have a major impact on in vivo pathogenesis of H7N9 human infection. Finally, genes coding for antigen presentation pathway proteins were upregulated only in H3N2-infected cells, while the expression of these genes was either unchanged by avian IAVs or downregulated by H7N9 virus. Notably, downregulation of the antigen presentation pathway was also observed in nonpolarized Calu-3 cells infected with avian VN1203 H5N1 virus while upregulated following human A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) infection or alpha IFN (IFN-\u03b1) treatment (V. D. Menachery, A. J. Eisfeld, L. Josset, A. C. Sims, M. G. Katze, Y. Kawaoka, and R. S. Baric, unpublished data). Therefore, downregulation or absence of induction of antigen presentation in infected epithelial cells is a characteristic of avian versus human IAVs. Given concerns about the immunogenicity of avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, mechanisms of antigen presentation pathway control and its implication in vivo warrant further exploration.",

Studies in mice (28) and in a patient (29) have shown low efficacy of NA inhibitors for H7N9 morbidity. Moreover, emergence of H7N9 virus resistant to NA inhibitors has been observed (18), and one of the resistance mutations (NA-R292K) induced high-level oseltamivir resistance without impairing viral replication and in vivo virulence (30). Finally, ribavirin, which shows in vitro activity against influenza viruses, including H7N9, is not currently approved for the treatment of influenza and has controversial efficacy in vivo (31). Developing alternative antiviral therapeutics is therefore a priority. Genome-based drug repurposing strategies relying on the identification of drugs reversing cell responses to viral infection have successfully identified antivirals against IAVs (25) and coronavirus (24). These strategies have the advantage of being able to screen a large number of available drugs in silico and potentially accelerate their use in clinics. Here, we used a combination of two complementary methods, a knowledge-based approach (using IPA) prioritizing drugs with published effects that are opposite to IAV-induced gene expression changes, and a data-based approach using drug gene expression profiles present in Cmap to determine whether drug treatment induced transcriptomic changes opposite to viral infection. Twenty-six molecules were predicted by the first method to modulate the host response to at least one IAV, and out of the 10 present in Cmap, 8 were found to induce gene expression changes opposite to IAV signatures after multiple cell line treatment. Drugs that were predicted by both methods for H7N9 were the kinase inhibitors SB203580, genistein, LY-294002, and the antibiotic minocycline. In addition, the antidiabetic drug troglitazone, which was just below our threshold for IPA prediction, was found in Cmap to significantly revert H7N9 signatures at 3, 7, and 12 hpi.",

This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show that minocycline also inhibits influenza virus replication in vitro. Moreover, this assay validates our in silico drug prediction.

Among the 3 drugs that did not show any effect on influenza virus replication or pathogenicity, dexamethasone was predicted only to be a potential anti-H7N7 agent, since it had a positive z score for H7N9, H3N2, and H5N1 infections at early time points and could therefore increase early viral replication. This could be linked to the controversial role of corticosteroids in patients with influenza acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which very early corticosteroid therapy may be harmful (35). Most likely, several drugs predicted here that had previously known anti-IAV effects may have broad antiviral effects and could be active against H7N9. FDA-approved drugs that are already used in clinics for diverse indications but not influenza and that were identified in our in silico screening and with previously published anti-influenza effects, such as chloroquine (36), are particularly interesting to consider for therapeutic intervention against H7N9.",

The whole-lung response to infection depends on the interaction between infected cells, immune cells, and the lung microenvironment. In addition, the host response to influenza infection depends on the cell type and differentiation levels of infected cells (37). We have highlighted in a recent review that novel mathematical models are needed to model interactions between cells and to integrate in vitro and in vivo studies (38). By using a multivariate modeling approach, McDermott et al. were able to predict pulmonary expression of conserved regulatory modules in macaques and mice in response to H5N1 infection from a regulatory model built from Calu-3 cells infected with H5N1 (39). In addition, numerous studies have shown that cell cultures are extremely useful experimental models for extended influenza virus-host interaction studies and for the screening of potential antivirals. In particular, polarized Calu-3 cells were shown to be valuable models for the study of influenza virus and supported viral replication and type I IFN responses similarly to primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (19). Culture systems of differentiated primary epithelial cells from humans, like HBE cells, recapitulate more closely the morphological features of the human upper airway but provide a less convenient and reproducible model for the study of influenza virus because of experiment, passage, and donor variations, inducing a variable differentiated phenotype (40). In this study, we used Calu-3 cell cultures to rapidly characterize the emerging H7N9 virus by comparing its response to several avian and human influenza viruses and to perform in silico screening for potential antivirals. We believe that this data set is a valuable resource for further studies of H7N9 and other influenza viruses. In two ongoing studies, we have been profiling mouse and macaque pulmonary responses to H7N9 infection (J. Morrison, L. Josset, N. Tchitchek, J. Chang, J. Belser, T. Tumpey, and M. G. Katze, submitted for publication; E. de Wit, A. Rasmussen, F. Feldmann, T. Bushmaker, C. Martellaro, E. Haddock, A. Okumura, S. Proll, J. Chang, D. Gardner, M. G. Katze, and V. J. Munster, submitted for publication). Importantly, we found that a significant number of drugs predicted to reverse Calu-3 cell responses to H7N9, including minocycline, SB203580, KN-62, and Jak Inhibitor 1, were also predicted to reverse the mouse and macaque pulmonary response to H7N9 infection (Morrison et al., submitted). This demonstrates conserved functional responses between these models.",

A negative z score indicates that the regulator is known to downregulate the same genes that were significantly upregulated after infection and/or to upregulate genes that were downregulated after infection. Dashed lines depict the limit of significance (|z score| > 2). For each virus, z scores were calculated using log2FC expression of DE genes at each time point, and molecules with significant negative z scores for at least 2 time points were selected for this representation (29 drugs). Potential antivirals were defined as drugs with a z score < \u22122 for at least 2 time points and no positive z score (molecules highlighted in color). Twenty-six regulators were predicted to have an effect opposite to that of infection for at least one IAV. Molecules were ranked from most- to least-negative mean z score across all conditions.

Gene expression profiles for 10 molecules (out of the 26) were found in the Cmap database and compared with IAV-infected profiles.
