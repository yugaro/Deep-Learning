Many attribute the popularization of the term to Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg, where he (anthropocentrically) defined the microbiome as \u201cthe ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space and have been all but ignored as determinants of health and disease\u201d [2]. The community of microorganisms referenced in these definitions includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Within this community there is an inherent plasticity arising from the interaction of organisms with one another and with their environment. Such meta-interactions lead to complex repercussions for each level of life, and this review will focus on the consequences that have implications for human health.",

From a philosophical perspective, viruses were likely integral to the very existence of man as the primordial precursor to all current life on earth [4]. More tangibly, during the course of human evolution, the viruses in and around humans not only drove evolution via selective pressure, but also contributed novel genetic material. In fact, approximately 42 percent of the human genome is composed of viral sequence [5]. This role as a major agent driving horizontal (i.e., non-reproductive) gene transfer between biomes [6-9] and the fact that the diversity, complexity, and abundance of viruses surpasses any other biological entity make it apparent that understanding viromes will impart unparalleled understanding of the organisms they inhabit [10].",

However, this technique is specific to organisms with ribosomes, so early research focused on analysis of bacterial sequences rather than much more technically challenging viral sequences [12]. Thankfully, recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies are making virome characterization more technologically and financially possible and will ensure an explosion of virome description in the near future [13,14].\n",

It is likely this was because human viruses rely on invasion of host cells to replicate and this provokes an overwhelmingly negative impression. However, all interactions of viruses with their hosts are symbioses in the classical sense [16] and fall along a spectrum from exclusively antagonistic to exclusively mutualistic [17]. In general, these interactions are facultative for the human and obligate for the virus, but cases like the presence of viral sequences in human genomes exemplify where this simplistic view breaks down [5]. While the position of a particular virus along this spectrum is not fixed, it is obvious that many viruses have varied, intimate relationships with their hosts.",

In a more benign example, the white clover suppresses nodulation in conditions of sufficient nitrogen in a manner dependent on viral coat proteins of a persistently infecting cryptic virus [22].

Here, I describe a conception of the human virome with three general classifications of virus types: Parasitic, Commensal, and Mutualistic (Figure 1). Within these groupings are subcategories containing more specific characteristics germane to different viral groups. Table 1 illustrates how representative members of the human virome spanning a vast array of families, replication schemes, genome architectures, and tropisms can be succinctly classified with this scheme. This arrangement provides functional information about the nature and plasticity of virus-host interaction, the most critical defining characteristic of a virus in the context of human health, in a way absent in the more classical types of organization mentioned above. In the rest of this review, I will characterize each grouping and provide examples from the literature supporting this classification. The application of this scaffold will not only deepen the understanding of known virus-host interactions in the ecological context of the virome, but will also identify logical next steps and gaps in current knowledge that are tantalizing areas for future exploration.",

Influenza virus is a prime example of the success of a pathogenic strategy. Most humans can expect to be infected with at least one influenza virus per year, and in general they will observe a fairly robust set of symptoms including, but not limited to, fever, chills, headache, nasal congestion, and coughing [40]. While infection can be severe and even cause death, this is typically limited to hosts in an immunocompromised state, as selective pressure typically drives virus evolution to less virulence [41]. In general, virus is shed one to two days after infection, with symptoms usually presenting one day later, ensuring that a person shedding virus will be out and about among currently uninfected individuals [42]. Severe symptoms may be due to viral replication and destruction of tissue; however, over-reaction of the immune system is often the cause [41]. This is exemplified by secondary bacterial pneumonia where blooms of pathogenic and/or commensal bacteria can result in severe disease or death [38-41]. However, by the time a person has become ill, they have likely spread the virus by direct contact with an uninfected individual, contaminated fomites, or aerosolized respiratory droplets [46].",

As far back as the 16th-11th centuries B.C., there is evidence of poliomyelitis caused by poliovirus in Egypt [47]. A more recent example is measles virus, which appears to have diverged from rinderpest sometime in the 11th or 12th century B.C. [48]. The long histories of human disease caused by these and other pathogenic viruses made them low hanging fruits for study in the new field of microbiology in the early 19th century [47]. This can explain much of the bias of current knowledge toward pathogenic viruses. While it can be argued that in the majority of human history these viruses were the most formative in terms of social, cultural, and behavioral characteristics of humans, it cannot be overlooked that this point may also be similarly biased. The notion that some viruses could live in relative homeostasis with the organisms they infect is very recent, and such interactions may prove to be a renaissance in the thinking of the importance of different portions of the virome. In fact, some of the most clinically important viruses of the last century were not classically pathogenic, but rather, persist within the host in relative silence for long periods of time.",

In this niche, the virus may go through stages of dormancy and reactivation, or slow replication for a long period of time [50]. This ability to progress to persistence for months, years, or the entire life of the host clearly delineates these viruses from the pathogenic viruses [51]. These relationships straddle the border somewhere between symbiosis and pathogenesis, traditionally making it difficult to classify them.

The answer lies in the spread of virus via close intra-host interactions that may occur many times during the host\u2019s life. The most conventional method by which persistent viruses are transmitted is contact between mucous membranes. This includes kissing and sexual intercourse, but can also include transmission vertically from mother to child, in rare cases [37]. The prototypical example is herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) which, after an initial acute or subclinical infection, moves into a sensory neuron and enters a period of latency [52]. Later in life the virus can break latency, move down the neuron to the skin, and begin to replicate, the prototypical presentation of which is a cold sore. These lesions release infectious virus that can be transmitted to a new host. After a short time, the virus returns to latency and the lesion will heal [52]. The success of this strategy of latency and mild pathogenic effect is made obvious by the fact that approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s population is infected with HSV-1 [53].",

In the autoimmune disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS), human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) syncytin expression is upregulated in lesions and leads to an increase of cellular protein oxidation and destruction of oligodendrocytes [61]. Another possible autoimmune contribution of EREs is by their engagement of nucleic acid pattern recognition and downstream immune activation during both their RNA and cDNA synthesis [62,63]. Carcinogenesis may also occur, as exemplified by the Rec protein of HERV-K(HML2), which can facilitate tumorigenesis when expressed in mice [64]. A final example of deleterious consequences conferred by EREs is their ability to destabilize the genome via insertion, rearrangement, and deletion [65].

It is known that humans harbor antibodies to phage proteins [67-70] and that phagocytic cells of the immune system can ingest phages [71], but whether this has any negative impact on health is unknown. Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) -7 and -9 play key roles in the production of autoantibodies, presumably via sensing of nucleic acid containing immune complexes (reviewed in [72]). These autoantibodies could be derived from any number of endogenous sources, including those of phages. Interestingly, identifying the particular nucleic acids responsible for this activation in vivo has been challenging, though functional work has vetted this mechanism with immune complexes containing nucleic acids [73,74]. It is possible that B-cell Receptor (BCR)-mediated endocytic or plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) phagocytic internalization of phages could deliver ligands necessary for these responses. In this light, I would argue that correlating phage localization and expression with disease state is a particularly intriguing area of research moving forward. Such research may also elucidate mechanisms by which specific bacteria (and their viral cargo) are linked to autoimmune, allergic, and pathogenic phenotypes.",

Trichomonas vaginalis harbors a Trichomonasvirus that triggers IFN responses via TLR-3, leading to inflammatory sequelae [77].

These organisms may be more accurately defined as atypically pathogenic or mutualistic (see sections above and below, respectively) if these effects are common or stable, but in general, scientists have followed the practice of innocence until proven guilty. However, it is likely that many commensals exist that either rarely or never have effects on the host.

The effect of phages on the composition of the microbiome, in that they may kill or inhibit growth of some bacteria, could be considered a possible detriment or benefit depending on the situation, albeit indirect. In fact, the targeted utilization of phages to eliminate unwanted bacterial pathogens (phage therapy) was introduced in the early 1900s and has many potential benefits including, but not limited to, low toxicity, treatment of antibiotic resistant infections, and rapid discovery/generation [89]. However, concern over unknown health implications and the rise of antibiotics stalled the field, though a renaissance has been building since the 1990s [90]. Many different levels of this application exist, such as treatment of animals and plants with phages to ensure better yield as well as to kill human pathogens that may grow on or in these food sources [91]. Phages are also known to be able to stimulate and/or modulate immune action in humans at multiple levels including antibody generation, development of adaptive immune cells, and innate pattern recognition (reviewed in [88]), and the possible applications of phages in these contexts are intriguing. In the future, sections of this group may be able to re-classified as atypically pathogenic or mutualistic if their presence can be linked to roles in specific disease phenotypes, but for now they are most appropriately classified as commensal.",

Direct effects on human health are likely rare, though they have been observed for protozoan parasite viruses (see Atypically Pathogenic Viruses, above). The presence of these viruses may ultimately have an indirect effect on human health of unknown consequence. Investigation of the breadth and impact of such viruses is an interesting and important area of future research, particularly for the benefit of the immunocompromised and those in developing countries who are most affected by diseases caused by fungi and protozoa. There is also an abundance of prototypically plant-tropic viruses found in the human gut [99]. It is likely these viruses have been acquired via agricultural crops in the diet and the effect of their presence is unknown, but assembly of plant viral particles in Escherichia coli has been exhibited, so it is possible that these viruses may interact with gut bacteria [100].",

These viruses establish asymptomatic infections that do not result in a change in host health or behavior. This represents a veritable antithesis to the strategy of parasitic human viruses (see The Parasitic Virome, above), wherein viruses have prioritized trade-offs other than pathogenicity to ensure their transmission to a new host. The most well documented examples of asymptomatic infection of humans by commensal viruses are the rhinoviruses and other infections of the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract [80,101-104]. Many of the Human Papilloma Viruses (HPVs) interact with human cells as an asymptomatic infection of mucous membranes or skin [105]. Anelloviruses are also well described human commensals [106-110]. While immune detection of non-human tropic commensal viruses is avoided by physical separation, the human-tropic commensal viruses assuredly engage with host innate and adaptive immune responses, and so must avoid or subvert these mechanisms to maintain their immunological silence. Description of the viral techniques enabling this evasion is an important direction for future research on these viruses, as this may point to novel avenues of therapeutic intervention for suppression or activation of immune responses.",

Where an ERE inserts itself can be an important factor in how it affects the genome, as insertion into a protein coding gene could be innocuous or catastrophic. Alternatively, insertion in or near promotion and regulatory elements can result in changes in transcriptional control [124], as can the native regulatory sequences in the EREs themselves [125,126].

Examples from mice also indicate that the expression of the ERV glycoprotein env can competitively bind surface receptors important for exogenous virus entry and that a short product of an ERV gag gene can inhibit the nuclear translocation of incoming capsids.

For years it has been debated whether gene therapy using retroviral vectors for insertion of genes into an individual would be of more help than harm. Overall the utility of such methods have been tempered by the observed oncogenic potential of such therapies [134]. Recently, studies with retroviral-modified Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells) have shown impressive application for the activation of adaptive immunity against cancers, though there have also been morbid failures in this field [135]. The application of retroviral-modified CAR T-cells could presumably be expanded to infectious disease as well. These progressive areas of medical science will continue to be explored and debated well into the future, and better understanding the relationship of EREs with their human hosts will be indispensable for these studies.",

A popular example is that of phages. Beginning with the microbial colonization of a child during birth, phages hitch a ride with their host bacteria. Phages can regulate bacterial species in the gut, as it is known that phages can be co-opted into mucosal surfaces for this purpose [136]. Free phages may also serve a similar role as sentinels maintaining a balanced microbiota. These benefits have been studied extensively as possible medical tools in phage therapy (reviewed in [137,138]) and there has recently been a resurgence of interest as the problem of antimicrobial resistance has become more dire [139]. These same principles can likely be extended to viruses that parasitize other microbes and macrobes as well.",

In general, these viruses likely compete for receptors, cellular resources, or niches within hosts to confer protection. Hepatitis G Virus (HGV) is known to slow development of HIV infection to AIDS pathogenesis [140,141] and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can suppress HIV infection by limiting availability of the coreceptor CCR5 on macrophages [142]. Infection with Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) can suppress infection with HCV and may actually promote clearance [143]. Evidence from mice supports the assertion that viruses can confer resistance to non-viral disease as well, as infection with murine gammaherpesvirus results in protection from challenge with Listeria [144] and Type 1 Diabetes can be prevented in mice infected with lymphotropic viruses [145]. Oncolytic viruses, which specifically target, infect, and kill tumor cells are also notable in both their novelty and their clinical utility (reviewed in [146-148]). Viruses may even be able to provide developmental and immunological benefits not unlike that of the bacterial microbiota, as evidenced by the establishment of gut homeostasis in mice colonized with norovirus [149]. Endogenous retroelements could also presumably be included here in the case of their population of a non-germline subset of cells within an individual and conferral of benefit to the host.",

This acknowledgement of convention and the departures from it gives both structure and flexibility to this conception of the human virome. The culmination of these ideas provides a template that identifies gaps in our current knowledge, postulates interactions that are currently unknown, and describes future areas of research, the results of which can then be classified in this same manner.
