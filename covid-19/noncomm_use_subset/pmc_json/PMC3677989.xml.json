This emerging febrile disease, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), was reported in 2007 by the New England Journal of Medicine (3) and Clinical Infectious Diseases (4-6). The etiology of SFTS turned out to be the SFTS virus. Yet most physicians are not familiar with this disease, and initially it is difficult to differentiate from other febrile illnesses (7-9).",

SFTS virus was transferred by the tick, H. longicornis. The incidence is high from May to August because of a lot of outdoor activities at that time, when ticks and mites usually absorb animal's body fluids in order to grow and proliferate. The case fatality of 6% has been reported. Yu et al. (3) observed the infected tissue by electron microscopy and revealed virions in Golgi apparatus with the morphologic characteristics of a bunyavirus, cytopathic effects (virus induced cellular changes), and granular particles in the cytoplasm. Additionally the possibilities of person-to-person spread were raised (5, 6). The same patients with SFTS began to occur in Japan and some of them died. On May 21, 2013, the first patient of SFTS in Korea was diagnosed at Seoul National University Hospital (1, 2). Only a few days later, another SFTS patient was confirmed in the Jeju island. The 2 cases confirmed that SFTS has been endemically transmitted in Korea.",

Higher animals including human had more genetic materials. No matter how seemingly some damage on DNA, biologic characters do not change. In addition, when mutations occur in the DNA, self-repair capacity inside the cell is triggered. However, the virus and its component materials are so small that it takes on a different look with just a slight change.",

Kass in Boston City Hospital, Harvard Medical School, made this statement in 1977 in reference to the newly discovered Legionnaire's disease. It could be applied equally to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (11), pandemic H1N1 influenza, mad cow disease, or any other new and mysterious disease (12). However, advanced medical technology including genetic engineering, molecular biology, found out the causative virus. In blood of the patient in our country who died in 2012, SFTS virus was identified (1). Some people simply grumble that diagnosis only is of no use and there should be a treatment. That is true but we need to keep in mind, \"more haste, less speed.\"",

While it is true that virus mutation happened ceaselessly ever, but a few virus vaccines have been properly produced. Therefore we should do our best to develop the vaccine. However, the human is not at the end of his rope against the virus. HIV was discovered as the causative agent in 3 yr after AIDS described. Doctors and scientists investigated how to transmit and spread, and diagnose HIV virus. While there is no silver bullet against AIDS, the life of patients can be extended longer than 5 yr after disease developed.
