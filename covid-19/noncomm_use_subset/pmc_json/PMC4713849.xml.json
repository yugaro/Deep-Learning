The field of molecular testing for pathogens has been expanded in clinical laboratories, and the molecular testing industry has responded quickly with the production of new molecular test kits. Numerous studies, including viral etiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and diagnostic tests, have been reported [3]. Despite the fact that clinical laboratory practice was a critical element in the response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak, there are only a few reports regarding this aspect of testing [245].",

MERS-CoV rRT-PCR testing at all medical institutions and referral medical laboratories increased dramatically in early June (Fig. 1). The number of clinical laboratories that initiated MERS-CoV testing increased in the first two to three weeks (Fig. 2). Daily test volumes peaked on June 24 (1,088 tests) and began to decrease thereafter (Fig. 1).

The outbreak of H1N1 influenza eventually turned out to be relatively mild, despite the fear it engendered as the potential early stage of a pandemic. Breban et al. [9] suggested that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. Nevertheless a MERS-CoV outbreak recently occurred in the Republic of Korea, and its characteristics were very different from those of the outbreak of H1N1 influenza. The MERS-CoV outbreak was more serious than expected, and numerous problems arose concerning infection control and prevention in hospitals and among the general public.",

In 2012 and 2013, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe conducted a joint survey [10]. Although the number of countries that had laboratory capabilities to detect and confirm MERS-CoV increased in 2013 (55.8%, 29 of 52 countries) compared with 2012 (47.8%, 22 of 46 countries), a half of the countries were still unable to test MERS-CoV [10].",

Most clinical laboratories participating in the survey were considered to have sufficient capacity to respond to the outbreak. Immediately after the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR test was approved, many laboratories were able to perform testing seven days a week and the number of tests reported increased dramatically. The median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories (57.7%) was shorter than 6 hr, and the minimum median TAT was 4.00 hr. The results were reported within 24 hr in all medical institutions except one. One limitation of our study is that even though we obtained responses from the majority of medical institutions and referral medical laboratories, the results may not be fully representative for a number of reasons. Data were collected before the end of the MERS-CoV outbreak and did not include some major medical institutions and public health laboratories such as the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, our results report the number of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR tests, and not the number of MERS-CoV cases.",

The laboratory diagnostic guidelines for MERS-CoV testing of the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine recommended using specimens from the lower respiratory tract. In the present survey, the number of positive results from MERS-CoV rRT-PCR was significantly higher in specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract (1.01%, 204/20,183) compared with specimens from the upper respiratory tract (0.6%, 41/6,785) (P=0.002, chi-square test).

However, no laboratory-acquired infections were reported during the outbreak, thus standard precautions with droplet precautions appeared to be sufficient for the prevention of laboratory-acquired infection of MERS-CoV. Nonetheless, improvements in engineering laboratory biosafety are needed for preparedness to test agents with a higher biosafety level.",

Although public health laboratories also test specimens to aid clinical decisions, their roles in surveillance, strain identification, and tracking of drug resistance are arguably their main priorities [12]. Moreover, clinical laboratories often have resources available that allow for rapid expansion [12]. In conclusion, the results of this survey contribute to the comprehensive view of clinical laboratory response in the Republic of Korea to the recent outbreak of 2015 MERS-CoV. On the basis of currently available data, clinical laboratories in Korea were able to expand their diagnostic capacity in a short time and achieve a TAT of shorter than nine hours with testing seven days per week to response to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak, although the delay in the early period of the outbreak should be improved. Therefore, clinical laboratories should be ready for the maintenance and enhancement of laboratory responses in preparation for future emerging infections.",
