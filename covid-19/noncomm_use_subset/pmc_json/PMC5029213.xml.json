            "text": "RNA viruses have rapid replication and high error rates, leading to immense diversity within each viral replication cycle (Domingo and Holland, 1997). As a result, many RNA viruses are highly genetically heterogeneous and exist within infected population structures known as quasispecies. It has been proposed that this gives these viral pathogens an increased ability to shift to a new environmental niche, such as a new host, as a suitable mutant is more likely to already exist if this opportunity arises. However, if the diversity within a quasispecies becomes too high, deleterious mutations can accumulate leading to loss of overall fitness (Clarke et al., 1993). The adaptability and host range of a virus are a function of the level of diversity found within a quasispecies (termed the quasispecies swarm size) (Schneider and Roossinck, 2001). As well as a randomly generated swarm of mutants around one variant, quasispecies can also exist as a number of master variants, each with their own swarm of random mutations (Palacios et al., 2008; Lauring and Andino, 2010). Determining the extent of genetic heterogeneity in virus populations thus has important implications for predicting and preventing emerging viral diseases.",

            "text": "The global decline in honey bee populations over the past few decades has been attributed to the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and its affiliation with Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) type A variant (Dainat et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2012; Schroeder and Martin, 2012; Francis et al., 2013). The role of honey bees as pollinators is vital to the environment and economy, as bees are a key pollinator species for agriculture. The economic value of honey bees is estimated to be more than 225 billion US dollars worldwide (Gallai et al., 2009). DWV, a member of the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genus Iflavirus (Lanzi et al, 2006), exists as a group of closely related viruses, often considered as variants of the same species complex (Ryabov et al., 2014). The ICTV (The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) database categorises DWV type A as two variants, DWV (Lanzi et al, 2006) and Kakugo virus (KV) (Fujiyuki et al., 2004). A second closely related virus Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV-1) is also part of the genus Iflavirus, which is now designated DWV type B (Martin et al., 2012; Mordecai et al., 2015). DWV type B was designated a separate species based on a nucleotide identity to DWV type A of \u223c84% that, according to demarcation criteria, is sufficient dissimilarity to warrant the creation of a new master variant (Fauquet et al., 2005). VDV-1 was originally isolated from V. destructor but has since been reported to replicate in honey bees (Ongus et al., 2004; Zioni et al., 2011) where it has been shown to cause wing deformities in bees (Zioni et al., 2011). DWV type B was also recently found to dominate the DWV population in honey bees from an isolated apiary in Swindon, UK (Mordecai et al., 2015); to the apparent exclusion of any other master variants. In honey bee populations that have never been exposed to Varroa mites, DWV exists in a very large variant swarm with numerous master variants (Martin et al., 2012). However, transmission of DWV by Varroa reduces variant diversity to one master variant (Martin et al., 2012). Therefore, DWV exists as an endlessly mutating swarm of variants with these master variants constituting part of this quasispecies and sharing a recent common ancestor (Baker and Schroeder, 2008; Martin et al., 2012). The dominance of one master variant over another will lead to ultimately different life histories for the colony, that is, death if DWV type A dominates (Martin et al., 2012) or health if DWV type B dominates (Mordecai et al., 2015).",

Certain biological traits may allow a virus to infect one cell type over another, known as cell tropism (Koyanagi et al., 1987). Whether or not a virus is able to infect a susceptible cell depends firstly on recognition of a cellular receptor on the cell surface and secondly on intracellular host factors that dictate whether the host cell is permissive to virus replication. Therefore, amino acid substitutions caused by nucleotide mutations in the structural or nonstructural region of the virus genome can affect both the host range and cell tropism of a virus. When categorising viruses based on a phylogenetic relationship it is important to note that a single amino acid change can have a substantial effect on the phenotypic traits of a virus. Therefore, when a virus exists as a collection of variants or quasispecies, although the phylogeny and ancestry of the viruses may be similar, the host range, tropism, pathogenicity and epidemiology of the variants may differ greatly (Domingo et al., 2012). In addition, recombination between these variants is a source of further variation (Moore et al., 2011).",

For similar reasons, the highly divergent nature of RNA viruses has been implicated in the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant infections in AIDS (Metzner et al., 2009), hepatitis C (Halfon and Locarnini, 2011), hepatitis B (Nishijima et al., 2012) and influenza (Boivin et al., 2002).",

Clone libraries and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the DWV type A as being associated with Varroa infestation and colony collapse (Martin et al., 2012). Although these techniques are valid for identifying known variants, primer-based methods are prone to missing unidentified variants and are biased towards overrepresented sequences (Gomez et al., 1999). PCR-based methods are less appropriate to determine the extent of variation in a quasispecies that is not normally distributed that is, where multiple variants exist, each with their own spectrum of mutants (Gomez et al., 1999). In these instances deep sequencing methods such as Illumina platforms are more suited to discovering new variants as well as to diversity analysis (Wood et al., 2014).",

Historical losses due to OCL of \u223c10% were normal; these have now risen to \u223c20% since the establishment of Varroa. This suggests that a \u2018new' non-Varroa-transmitted DWV master variant may be circulating in some colonies during the winter causing OCL. To investigate this hypothesis we used a bespoke de novo assembly pipeline (Mordecai et al., 2015). The Vicuna (broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/projects/viral-genomics/vicuna) de novo assembler was used as it is designed to assemble highly heterogeneous viral populations and is well suited to the computational challenge that the DWV quasispecies present (Yang et al., 2012). As well as assembling the DWV type A master variant, a third DWV master variant (Type C) was assembled and confirmed to be distinct through phylogenetic inference.",

We used a Bayesian approach using MrBayes (v. 3.1.2) (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). We assumed a fixed rate model of protein evolution and reconstructed the phylogeny using a model jumping method. This method allows for different models of amino acid substitution to be used in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, with all models contributing to the final result weighted according to their respective posterior probability. We ran two runs of four chains for 4 000 000 MCMC generations, sampling trees every 1000 generations. All trees were drawn using FigTree v.1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",

To test whether these fragments contain a molecular clock signal, we estimated the root-to-tip divergence using Path-o-gen v.1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/pathogen/) to estimate how much genetic variation can be explained by the sampling date. We constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees without the assumption of a molecular clock in Phylip v. 3.695 (evolution.genetics.washington.edu; Felsenstein, 1989) and tested whether the regression between root-to-tip distance in these maximum likelihood trees and the age of the samples indicated a clock-like signal. In addition, we tested for a significant temporal signal by randomising the temporal information across each data set 100 times and compared the resulting random evolutionary rates from BEAST with the real data set. A temporal signal is supported if there is a significant difference between the real data set and the randomised data sets (Ramsden et al., 2009; Alizon and Fraser, 2013). Both analyses support a temporal signal in these data sets (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S4).",

As this method is very computationally intensive, we first used a range of simpler tests to limit the number of models to be compared by this method as suggested by Alizon and Fraser (2013), and Drummond and Bouckaert (2014). For the three large temporal data sets, we used jModelTest v.2.1.1 (https://github.com/ddarriba/jmodeltest2; Posada, 2008) to compare substitution models based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (Alizon and Fraser 2013); the resulting substitution models were the Tamura-Nei (TnR) model (lp-fragment) and the Hasegawa, Kashino and Yano (HKY) model (vp3- and RdRp-fragments), both with Gamma variation. For the DWV-subtype data set, we compared the general time-reversible model and the SRD06 model (Shapiro et al., 2006) using path sampling. We partitioned substitution rates between the first and second and third codon positions as, for all data sets, the third codon position had a significantly higher rate. We tested whether a strict clock rate can be excluded by running models with a lognormal relaxed clock; if the relaxed clock's coefficient of variation statistic abuts the zero boundary, a strict clock cannot be excluded (Gray et al., 2011). We ran models with exponential population growth for all models; if the exponential growth rate was significantly higher than zero, a constant population size can be excluded. We then used path sampling to distinguish between clock models (exponential and lognormal relaxed clock) and demographic models (constant population size, exponential population growth or a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF skyride); Drummond et al., 2002; Minin et al., 2008) as indicated for each fragment by the initial analyses. Based on these analyses, we chose an exponential relaxed clock and exponential growth prior for the lp- and capsid-fragments and a lognormal relaxed clock and constant growth prior for the RdRp-fragment as well as for the DWV-subtype analyses.",

Competitive alignment to the now three master variants revealed that out of the ~30 million DWV blast positive reads, ~27 million were assembled to one of three genomes (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S1). Around 3 million assembled to type A, ~3.5 thousand to type B and ~24 million to Type C. As expected, more reads align to the 3\u2032 region of the genome than the 5\u2032 an artefact of the reverse transcription 3\u2032 bias (Brooks et al., 1995). Although reads aligned to the whole of the Type C genome, the depth of coverage was lower at the 5\u2032 region (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, coverage of the 5\u2032 region of the type A variant was unusually high, indicating that this disproportionate coverage in the 5\u2032 regions of type A and C could be the evidence of recombination between the two variants. Because of the low read depth and coverage for type B in our samples, a full genome could not be assembled (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S1). Nonetheless, closer examination of 3\u2032 region where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene is located (Baker and Schroeder, 2008) revealed that the Devon type B variant shared 100% identity to VDV-1 type B genome in this region (Supplementary Figure S2). The sequence identity of our newly assembled type A and C variants was compared with other members of the DWV complex (Table 1 and Figure 1). Both type B and C differ from the type A nucleotide sequence in similar regions of the genome.

However, the number of variants is not exhaustive and it is conceivable that more variants will be added in the future as the use of NGS becomes increasingly prolific. The result further suggests that Type C has not recently emerged, but rather is an established DWV variant. Moreover, using reverse transcriptase-PCR to amplify a region of the DWV RdRp gene, Martin et al. (2012) attributed a novel variant to the type B swarm of variants, although it is now clear that this novel variant was in fact Type C. The presence of Type C in Hawaii implies that this variant is widespread and not specific to the United Kingdom. It also confirms that it has not emerged recently as the Hawaiian sample originates from Kauai that has yet to be colonised by Varroa (Martin et al., 2012), suggesting Type C is part of the wild-type DWV quasispecies.",

DWV is a \u2018generalist' known to infect bumblebees (Genersch et al, 2006; F\u00fcrst et al., 2014), V. destructor (Ongus et al., 2004) and other insects (reviewed in Manley et al., 2015). Further work is required to ascertain whether Type C causes acute wing deformities in honey bees or its presence is because of viral \u2018spill over' from another host. Three of the four samples in this study were taken from a hive (GD1) that went on to collapse from OCL. However, as type A and the type A\u2013C 5\u2032 recombinant were also present, it remains unclear which variant was responsible for OCL. It is worth noting however that between 85% and 98% of the reads in hive GD1 were Type C that make up the Type C or the A\u2013C recombinant genomes (Supplementary Table S1). The second hive (GD2) that survived OCL contained roughly equal levels of type A and C reads (which includes reads that make up the A\u2013C recombinant); yet, the coverage indicates that the viral load was much lower in this hive. Moreover, the low abundance of DWV type B in these Devon colonies appears to confirm the observation made in the colonies from Swindon (Mordecai et al., 2015); that is, DWV type B is not present at sufficient levels to protect the honey bee from the virulent type A, or possibly C variants (as well as any recombinants between A and C). In addition, Varroa mites in the Devon colonies were controlled using chemical methods, thereby potentially preventing the mites from transmitting type B into the honey bees; as observed in the Swindon Apiary (Mordecai et al., 2015).",

The capacity of DWV to exist as a swarm of recombining variants and occupy large amounts of sequence space may be one of the factors contributing to its capability to maintain a persistent infection. Defining DWV as a quasispecies with discrete master variants is comparable with the current categorisation of several other RNA viruses. The genetic variability within Hepatitis C virus has been classified into four hierarchical strata: genotypes, sub-genotypes, isolates and finally background variation of the quasispecies (Farci and Purcell, 2000). A total of seven Hepatitis C virus genotypes exist to date, differing from each other by >15% over their complete coding region (Smith et al., 2014). Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus is currently classified into five genotypes based on sequence identity that differ in replication efficiency in a range of hosts (Han et al., 2014). In order to further our understanding of DWV and the impact of the virus on honey bees as well as other hosts, a more progressive classification of the DWV quasispecies would be prudent, that is, the new classification of DWV as a quasispecies with at least three master variants that can recombine with each other.",

Exploring the extent of viral diversity in RNA quasispecies, of which DWV may be a suitable model, may offer insight into the mechanisms by which viruses are able to transmit between different hosts as well as how viruses are able to develop resistance to antiviral therapies (Domingo et al., 2012).
