Furthermore, M133-specific T reg cells were present in the infected CNS until at least 49 d after infection. M133-specific T reg cells were not routinely detected above background in draining cervical LNs (CLNs) or spleen (unpublished data). Staining with M133 tetramer was specific because no positive cells were detected in mice infected with an rJ2.2 variant in which the epitope was mutated, abrogating recognition (rJ.2.2.MY135Q; Fig. 1 D; Anghelina et al., 2006).",

Remarkably, \u223c4\u20136% of all CNS (pooled brain and spinal cord)-derived T reg cells expressed IFN-\u03b3, after peptide M133 stimulation at 14 d after infection (Fig. 2 A). We also identified IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells specific for a second rJ2.2-specific CD4 T cell epitope, S358 in the CNS. In experiments described later in this paper, cells were stimulated with M133 and S358 peptides together (M133 + S358) because virus-specific T reg cells were present in low numbers in the infected CNS (Fig. 2 B). Virus-specific IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells were detected as early as 6 d after infection, at the same time that virus-specific effector CD4 T cells could be identified (Haring et al., 2001), and were present at approximately the same frequency in both the acute and chronic stages of the infection (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb, the fraction of T reg cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 increased two- to fourfold, suggesting that M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells accounted for only a fraction of all IFN-\u03b3+ T reg cells in the CNS (Fig. 2, B\u2013D). Notably, the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\u03b3 expression was lower in M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells, indicating less expression on a per-cell basis (Fig. 2 F). To verify that T reg cells produce IFN-\u03b3 in vivo, we treated B6 mice with brefeldin A (BFA) at 6 d after infection (Fig. 2 E; Liu and Whitton, 2005). In the absence of BFA, some Foxp3\u2212 CD4 T cells were IFN-\u03b3+, consistent with results showing that cells in the infected brain express IFN-\u03b3 in the absence of ex vivo stimulation (Fig. 2 A). The frequency of Foxp3\u2212 and Foxp3+ cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 increased twofold and fivefold, respectively, after in vivo BFA treatment, confirming in situ IFN-\u03b3 expression by T reg cells. Consistent with the in vitro peptide stimulation analyses, the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\u03b3 expression was lower in T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells after in vivo BFA treatment (Fig. 2 F).",

As a control, we isolated GFP+ T reg cells from mice infected with rJ2.2.MY135Q, which does not express epitope M133. As shown in Fig. 4 A, T reg cells harvested from rJ2.2, but not from rJ2.2.MY135Q-infected mice, suppressed proliferation of brain-derived effector T cells after M133 peptide stimulation. In contrast, T reg cells from brains infected with either virus were suppressive after stimulation with anti-CD3 (Fig. 4 B). To determine the relative suppressive ability of brain-derived T reg cells, we compared them to T reg cells isolated from naive spleens in proliferation assays as described in Materials and methods. In these assays, responder cells were harvested from uninfected spleens and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. The brain-derived T reg cells were more suppressive than splenic T reg cells (Fig. 4 C), possibly because T reg cells from sites of inflammation are more activated than those derived from naive mice. Consistent with this, brain-derived T reg cells expressed higher levels of CD69, ICOS, and CTLA-4 directly ex vivo and of IL-10 after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody or PMA and ionomycin (Fig. S3).",

To address this, we used MHC/peptide tetramers and magnetic bead technology, which facilitates the identification of epitope-specific precursor T cells in naive mice (Moon et al., 2009). Using this approach and I-Ab/M133 tetramers, we detected 163 \u00b1 10 Foxp3\u2212 and 25 \u00b1 2 Foxp3+ M133-specific CD4 T cells per three naive Foxp3gfp mice (n = 3; Fig. 5 A).

Our results demonstrate the presence of virus-specific Foxp3+ T reg cells in the rJ2.2-infected CNS but also show that they are present at a low frequency (Figs. 1 and 2). Detection was initially facilitated by the availability of M133-specific MHC class II tetramers. However, we previously showed that this tetramer was not as efficient as cytokine expression in identifying M133-specific effector CD4 T cells (Zhao et al., 2009). Subsequently, we identified a greater frequency of M133-specific T reg cells by cytokine staining for IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 after peptide stimulation. IL-10 expression may be particularly useful for detecting epitope-specific T reg cells because IL-10 was produced in virally infected mice and in mice with EAE after peptide stimulation (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). IFN-\u03b3 production by T reg cells was previously demonstrated in a lethal toxoplasmosis infection (Oldenhove et al., 2009), but our results indicate that IFN-\u03b3 is also expressed in the context of a nonlethal viral infection and continues even as the inflammatory response subsides (Fig. 2). The continued expression of IFN-\u03b3 by virus-specific T reg cells likely occurs because virus antigen persists in the infected CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009). Epitope M133-specific T reg cells suppressed proliferation of effector CD4 T cells responding to the same epitope, suggesting that if IFN-\u03b3 expression diminishes T reg cell suppressive function, its effect is limited. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells were detected in the CNS and not draining CLNs or spleen (Fig. 1 and not depicted), suggesting that they function by directly inhibiting T cell function or diminishing antigen presentation by microglia or other antigen-presenting cells at the site of inflammation.",

In several infectious diseases, including patients infected with West Nile virus or Dengue fever virus, higher T reg cell frequencies correlated with improved outcomes (L\u00fchn et al., 2007; Lanteri et al., 2009). Relevant for our results, Mtb-specific TCR Tg T reg cells were more potently suppressive than Mtb-nonspecific TCR Tg T reg cells in infected mice (Shafiani et al., 2010). Furthermore, although transfer of natural T reg cells diminished disease in the setting of autoimmune disease, suppression was estimated to be \u223c20\u201350-fold more potent if T reg cells were specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation (Tang et al., 2004; Tarbell et al., 2004). Thus, islet-specific T reg cells prevented diabetes in NOD mice, whereas nonspecific T reg cells at the same dosage could not. If true for rJ2.2-specific T reg cells, these cells may be especially potent in diminishing immunopathology in mice with encephalomyelitis and would be most activated and, thereby, suppressive during acute infection when viral antigen is maximal (Bergmann et al., 2006).",

After reconstitution, these Rg mice were infected with rJ2.2. The majority of CD4 T cells in the infected CNS were GFP+. I-Ab/M133 tetramer+ GFP+ cells were sorted from the infected CNS and analyzed for TCR-\u03b1 chain expression. Two TCR-\u03b1 chains (V\u03b12.3 and TRAV14-1), differing by a single amino acid in the CDR3 region, were detected using RT-PCR\u2013based cloning. One of these TCR-\u03b1 was synthesized and cloned into the same retroviral vector described in this section. In this vector, the TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 chains are linked via the 2A protease, facilitating cleavage. Because the two chains are linked on the same molecule, they are produced in stoichiometric amounts. TCR Rg mice expressing both M133-specific TCR-\u03b1 and TCR-\u03b2 were produced. Epitope M133 specificity was confirmed by analysis of GFP+ cells in the infected CNS using M133-specific tetramer and IFN-\u03b3 expression after peptide stimulation.",
