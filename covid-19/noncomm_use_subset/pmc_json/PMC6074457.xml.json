As the actual MERS-related morbidity and mortality for these cities could not be determined, the fatality rate (42%) may have been underestimated. As suspected, cases that presented at community or private clinics in these cities may not have been included in the analysis, so the results may not truly reflect the severity and impact of MERS.",

Regarding nationality, Saudis and non-Saudis appear to have almost the same risk of exposure. Among all nationalities, Filipinos appear to be at highest risk, as the majority of nurses in Saudi Arabia are Filipino. Regarding occupation, healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring MERS than non-HCWs. Regarding sex, males in Jeddah appear more susceptible, probably due to their participation in outdoor activities, while females in Taif appear more susceptible, probably due to their exposure to confirmed cases in the home. Regarding symptomatology, the frequent finding of cough (65%), fever >38\u00b0C (63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (60%), and shortness of breath (52%) among symptomatic cases validates the current MERS case definition and the findings of other regional studies. A particularly important finding was that despite strict MoH requirements that public and private healthcare facilities report cases of any notifiable diseases, including MERS,21 and the establishment of hotlines throughout the country, the reporting of all MERS cases remains challenging. As the regular reporting of cases to higher authorities is essential for key decision making,21 this challenge must be overcome.",

This knowledge will assist in the establishment of health facilities and isolation wards; procurement of personal protective gear, ambulances, ventilators, laboratory equipment, and supplies; hiring of additional healthcare staff; and enhancing capacity through appropriate training. Central to this effort is establishing private\u2013public healthcare partnerships for both effective response and collaborative research. Further regional studies performed collaboratively by experts from universities, the private sector, regional health directorates, the WHO, and the CDC are required to gain knowledge of the true epidemiology and burden of MERS.",
