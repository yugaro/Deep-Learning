Acute respiratory failure was followed by ARDS, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. His respiratory status began to improve on HD 16, and he was taken off the mechanical ventilator on HD 28. The patient remained drowsy and exhibited bilateral ptosis up to 31 h after the administration of the sedative midazolam was stopped on HD 25. A neurological examination revealed complete external ophthalmoplegia and mild limb ataxia. Weakness was also suspected in all four limbs [Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4]. Nystagmus, sensory changes, and oropharyngeal or facial palsy were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased in all limbs. The results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were normal, including a negative CSF MERS-CoV RT-PCR assay. An electroencephalogram exhibited diffuse slow-wave activity. Nonspecific results were obtained in laboratory studies performed at the onset of neurological symptoms, including in assays to determine the glucose, thiamine, blood gas, ammonia, electrolyte, and creatinine levels. He was diagnosed with Bickerstaff's encephalitis (BBE) overlapping with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS).

Because this patient had a preceding infection history, relative symmetric motor weakness, and a monophasic course with a clinical nadir within 4 weeks followed by a plateau, we considered GBS variant as a possible diagnosis.14 BBE, one of the GBS variants, is considered a subtype of GQ1b antibody syndrome and is classically diagnosed based on its characteristic clinical features of progressive symmetric external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and impaired consciousness.15 Because patient 1 had the classical triad of BBE accompanied by limb weakness, a diagnosis of BBE overlapping with GBS was suggested.14 We excluded many BBE-mimicking conditions in this patient based on his clinical history, brain MRI, and CSF findings. The presence of antiganglioside antibodies and albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF supported the diagnosis of BBE as part of the GBS spectrum. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of BBE is largely dependent on its clinical presentation. The absence of laboratory findings does not rule out a BBE diagnosis.16",

However, we considered it unlikely that Wernicke's encephalopathy was present in patient 1 for several reasons: 1) he showed none of the typical changes associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy in brain MRI, which has particularly high sensitivity (97\u2013100%) in patients without alcohol abuse,17 2) the ptosis and complete ophthalmoplegia that were observed in this patient are rare in Wernicke's encephalopathy,18 and 3) thiamine deficiency was not confirmed in laboratory tests and the patient did not have dietary deficiencies or alcoholism. Critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy appears frequently in ICU patients but was not thought to be present in patient 1 because ophthalmoparesis and ptosis are very rare in critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.19 Prolonged neuromuscular blockade was another possible consideration in this clinical setting, but a neuromuscular blocking agent was not administered in patient 1. The limb and ocular weakness had lasted for almost 2 months, and this duration would be an unusual response to the prolonged administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent. Neurological signs typically completely recover within 1\u20132 weeks in patients with prolonged neuromuscular blockade.19",

ICU-acquired weakness is diagnosed when a critically ill patient has limb weakness or ventilator dependency without heart or lung disease.20 GBS was another possible diagnosis, since the patient experienced symmetric limb weakness following viral infection with a typical monophasic disease course.14 These two diseases are differentiated by the presence of albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, positivity for antiganglioside antibodies, or demyelinating or axonal patterns in electrophysiology.1819 Patient 2 was evaluated neurologically after discharge, when her neurological symptoms had substantially improved; a lumbar puncture was therefore not performed, and critical information from laboratory studies was also not available. However, we cautiously supported a diagnosis of ICU-acquired weakness in patient 2, because a paraparetic presentation (as observed in this patient) is extremely rare in GBS and because dysautonomia and cranial nerve palsy, which frequently accompany GBS, were not observed in this patient.1821",
