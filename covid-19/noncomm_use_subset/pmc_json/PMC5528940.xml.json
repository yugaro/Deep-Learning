A significant factor contributing to the prognosis of CPxV infection in cats is the speed at which appropriate therapy is instituted, so rapid recognition is crucial. Cytological analysis of the affected organs can be misleading, with the secondarily dysplastic cells having the potential to mimic neoplasma. Instead, electron microscopy, virus isolation and PCR of tissues (including skin scabs, bronchoalveolar or pleural fluid, or pulmonary aspirates) are the easiest ways to confirm the diagnosis.5 Serum assays (including virus neutralisation, haemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation and ELISA) can be utilised to detect a humoral response to orthopoxvirus, although a rising titre is required to support active infection.4",

Reported clinical signs for CPxV infection are typically skin lesions (commonly found on the head, neck and forelimbs) and, rarely, fatal necrotising pneumonia.4,7\u201310 Interestingly, no skin lesions were evident in this case \u2013 this has previously been described in a single cat with CPxV pneumonia.11 The lack of cutaneous pathology may reflect the fact that, in rare cases, the virus can be transmitted by the oronasal route.12",
