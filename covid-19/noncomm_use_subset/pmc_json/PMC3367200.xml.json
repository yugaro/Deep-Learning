            "text": "During the replication of mammalian viruses, it is inevitable for host proteins to be involved in the viral life cycles. In fact, coronaviruses require host proteins to aid in the stages from virus entry to progeny release. Entry of the virus particle into a host cell requires the recognition of specific cell surface proteins, which act as receptors for the virus spike (S) protein (1\u20136). Upon entry into host cells, the ribonucleocapsid uncoats and releases the 5\u2032-capped viral genome, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The genomic RNA ranges from 27 to 32 kb in length, is the largest known of its kind and is structurally similar to host mRNA (7). The replicase gene, which spans the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, is translated by host ribosomes into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab via a frameshift event (8\u201310). The polyproteins are autoproteolytically processed into a maximum of 16 nonstructural proteins (8,11\u201316), which are assembled into replication\u2013transcription complexes, including the main enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (17,18). This complex is required for generating new full-length virus RNA in replication as well as subgenome-length RNAs to be used for translation of virus structural and accessory proteins. In addition to their role in RNA synthesis, these nonstructural proteins may have multiple functions, such as the suppression of host mRNA translation as well as mRNA degradation by nsp1 of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV; 19\u201321), which may play a role in the suppression of immune response mounted by the host upon infection.",

More recently, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), hnRNP Q and glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) were found to play a role in coronavirus RNA synthesis through their interaction with the 3\u2032-UTR of alphacoronavirus TGEV (32).

Subsequently, the RNA-binding domain of MADP1 and the RNA secondary structure responsible for the interaction were mapped and defined. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we confirmed that MADP1, despite being reported as a nuclear protein (35), was detected in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells and partially co-localized with the RTCs.

Screens were also performed using the negative sense 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR as bait. Each screen yielded about six to eight colonies which were sequenced and non-sense sequences of the candidates were eliminated. In total, the screen identified three candidates, MADP1, HAX1 and ribosomal protein L27a as binding partners to SARS-CoV positive sense 5\u2032-UTR, negative sense 5\u2032-UTR and negative sense 3\u2032-UTR, respectively. Although it was interesting to find ribosomal protein L27a interacting with the anti-sense 3\u2032-UTR, which was not required for viral protein translation, subsequent functional studies of the protein would prove to be complicated as the virus itself relies heavily on the host ribosome to translate viral proteins, necessary for the infection to proceed. Therefore, it was not chosen for further studies. HAX1 was reported to function as an anti-apoptotic protein, which was not the focus of our screen and was therefore not chosen for further studies as well. MADP1 was reported as a member of the alternative splicing pathway, which implied a possible role in facilitating distal RNA sequences to be brought into close proximity, corresponded well with current evidence on the mechanism of discontinuous transcription. Therefore, it was chosen as the sole target for this study.",

IBV replication and transcription, on the other hand, take place in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Therefore, to validate the likelihood of MADP1 interacting with the viral 5\u2032-UTR, immunofluorescence was used to track the subcellular localization of both Flag-tagged MADP1 and de novo synthesized viral RNA in both mock-infected and IBV-infected cells. Flag-tagged MADP1 was over-expressed in cultured Vero cells, which were then infected with IBV and treated with actinomycin D to inhibit host transcription. The newly synthesized viral RNA, a marker for the RTCs, was labeled with BrUTP. The cells were fixed at 10 h post-infection to allow sufficient labeling of the newly synthesized viral RNA and to minimize the formation of large syncytial cells. In uninfected cells, Flag-tagged MADP1 was localized in the nucleus exclusively (Figure 2). Upon infection by IBV, Flag-tagged MADP1 appeared to be present in the cytoplasm as well (Figure 2). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic localization pattern of Flag-tagged MADP1 appears to be partially overlapped with that for the RTCs, although further studies would be required to ascertain if MADP1 would be a part of the RTCs (Figure 2). As a negative control for the over-expressed protein, vector transfected cells probed with Flag antibody showed negative staining for the over-expressed protein (Figure 2). Similar colocalization patterns were also observed in IBV-infected H1299 cells (Figure 2).\n",

An extension of 14 or 31 amino acid residues was made for mutants Madp1x and Madp1z, respectively. A truncation at the N-terminus by 40 residues as well as an extension by 14 amino acid residues was made for Madp1y. It was observed that both Madp1x and Madp1z bound to IBV 5\u2032-UTR more strongly than did the full-length protein as well as Madp1n mutant protein (Figure 4B, 1x, 1z). Madp1y, on the other hand, bound weakly to the RNA fragment (Figure 4B, 1y). Hence, the 14 amino acid extension beyond the RRM (Madp1x) may have been required to preserve the integrity of the protein structure and that the 40 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of MADP1 are required for efficient RNA binding.",

Hence, three mutants with either a single alanine substitution for tyrosine 13 (Y13A), a double alanine substitution for valine 53 and phenylalanine 55 (V53F55A) or triple alanine substitutions for all three residues (YVF), were constructed (Figure 4A). These three mutants were over-expressed in H1299 cells as Flag-tagged proteins, and the lysates were assessed for their respective RNA-binding affinities for full-length IBV 5\u2032-UTR (Figure 4C). All mutants resulted in a reduction in RNA-binding affinity for the biotinylated RNA molecule and the reduction was most dramatic for triple residue mutant YVF (Figure 4C), implying cooperative binding demonstrated by the three residues.

This protein was shown to be localized to the nucleoplasm but excluded from the nucleolus, but its role in RNA splicing remains to be determined (37). MADP1 contains two conserved RNA-binding domains, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) 1 and universal minicircle sequence binding protein (UMSBP) domains (a zinc finger CCHC-type) (35).

A deeper look at the details of this interaction revealed that the RNA recognition motif, but not the zinc finger motif, of MADP1, is responsible for the interaction. This interaction is also shown to be specific and stem\u2013loop I of IBV 5\u2032-UTR is essential for the interaction to occur. Although MADP1 was reported to be a nuclear protein (35), it could be detected in the cytoplasm of IBV-infected cells and partially overlaps with the de novo synthesized viral RNA, which marks the location of the RTCs in infected cells in the presence of actinomycin D. Silencing of MADP1 resulted in a marked reduction in syncytium formation upon IBV infection. A closer examination revealed that the synthesis of both genome- (gRNA) and subgenome-length RNAs (sgRNA) was compromised, resulting in a drastic reduction of viral structural protein expression and release of viral progeny (titers), hence the overall reduction of viral infectivity in the cells.",

Mutations introduced into either stem\u2013loop I or II resulted in non-viable viruses, impaired (sense and anti-sense) sgRNA synthesis, but not the full-length gRNA synthesis (38,44). It was, however, observed in this study that silencing of MADP1 did render an impact on gRNA synthesis, although to a lesser extent compared to sgRNA synthesis. This might have been due to a secondary effect of decreased sgRNA synthesis, as proteins encoded by sgRNAs may enhance viral RNA synthesis (45). The predicted structure of stem\u2013loop II indicated a strong secondary interaction, which is highly conserved across different groups of coronaviruses. The predicted stem\u2013loop I structure, on the other hand, appears to fold into a hairpin of low thermodynamic stability, shows a wider sequence variation and is characterized by the presence of bulges, non-canonical base pairing as well as a prevalence of A-U base pairing (46). It has been shown in MHV that the structural liability of stem\u2013loop I is a critical driving force in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR interaction (44). Comparing the predicted stem\u2013loop I structures of IBV to SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Figure 8B), it was noted that there exists a difference in the loop sequence. In addition, IBV stem\u2013loop I has a shorter stem and the absence of bulges, although the structure may be as unstable thermodynamically as that of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, due to the extremely high prevalence of weak base pairing between A and U as well as the presence of a non-canonical base pair at the base of the stem (46). Hence, sequence and structural differences may be one of the possible explanations for the observation of a weaker binding between MADP1 and SARS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 5\u2032-UTR than with IBV 5\u2032-UTR. In fact, the relatively weaker binding of MADP1 to the stem\u2013loop I restoring mutant (5\u2032-UTR\u03942M2) demonstrated in this study supports that primary sequences in the 5\u2032-UTR may play a certain role in this interaction.",

Identification of the interaction between MADP1 and 5\u2032-UTR as well as its functional involvement in coronavirus replication, in this study, therefore may represent the first host protein identified to play a role in viral RNA synthesis by interacting with the 5\u2032-UTR of the viral RNA in a gammacoronavirus. The functional implication of the interaction between MADP1 and IBV 5\u2032-UTR may be extended to the rest of the members of the coronavirus family. In the case of hnRNP A1, it was initially reported to be functionally important for viral RNA synthesis for group II virus MHV (29,30). Subsequently, its involvement in viral RNA synthesis was also confirmed in TGEV, a group I coronavirus (32). In this study, we have shown that betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and gammacoronavirus IBV can bind to MADP1, albeit with different affinities. Due to the lack of a high containment facility, the functional implication of the relatively weaker interaction between SARS-CoV 5\u2032-UTR and MADP1 was not further studied. It is, therefore, yet to be demonstrated if this weaker binding dictates less dependency on MADP1 in SARS-CoV RNA replication and infectivity.",

As there was no report on the possibility of MADP1 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, our observation using indirect immunofluorescence that over-expressed MADP1 upon IBV infection became partially localized in the cytoplasm may represent a first report that MADP1 could be localized outside the nucleus. This could have been achieved with either an existing shuttling mechanism used by a nuclear protein or the assistance of viral factors. For example, IBV N protein is known to enter the nucleus while maintaining a predominantly cytoplasmic localization (50,51). Alternatively, binding of viral RNA may partially retain the newly synthesized MADP1 in the cytoplasm, as observed in this study.",

Considering the fact that only 30% of cells were transfected and over-expressed MADP1 protein despite the presence of a higher level of the protein in the transfected cells, it is understandable that the expression of viral proteins could not be restored after combining both transfected and untransfected cells. Interestingly, over-expression of silencing-sensitive MADP1 was unable to cause an increase in virus infection, comparing to that was observed for silencing-resistant MADP1 (FMmut) in shMadp1 cells, even though their expression levels were comparable.

RT-PCR analyses of the mRNA levels of MADP1, the negative strand IBV RNA (gRNA(-)), (+) and (\u2013) mRNAs 3 and 4 (sgRNA) and control GAPDH were carried out. (B) Western blot analyses of the protein levels of Madp-1, viral proteins spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and cellular protein actin for loading control. (C) TCID50 of total virus produced by the virus-infected cells showed that the silencing of Madp1 reduced virus titers by several folds. (D) Luciferase gene activity measured for the cell lysate indicated a dramatic drop in viral activity in the Madp1 silenced H1299 cells.",

Total RNA was prepared from the two G418-selected stable clones and separated on 1% agarose gel and probed by a Dig-labeled specific MADP1probe. (B) Northern blot analysis of IBV RNAs in IBV-infected shNC and shMadp1 stable clones. Cells were infected with IBV-Luc at a multiplicity of \u223c1, harvested at 0, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20 h post-infection, respectively. Total RNA was prepared, separated on 1% agarose gel and probed by a Dig-labeled specific probe. (C) Western blot analysis of IBV N protein expression in IBV-infected siMadp1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant MADP1. shMadp1 stable cell clone was transfected with constructs expressing Flag-tagged wild-type MADP1 (FM) and its triple mutant [FM(YVF)], siRNA-resistant MADP1 (FMmut) and its triple mutant [FMmut(YVF)], negative controls EGFP (E), and empty vector control (F), respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were then infected with IBV-Luc virus at a multiplicity of \u223c1, and harvested at 19 h post-infection for western blot. Over-expressed Madp1 and IBV N were detected with specific antibodies, and actin was detected with a commercial antibody as a loading (Santa Cruz).
