            "text": "Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease associated with an increasing prevalence characterized by airway inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness [1]. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness may occur in response to many common environmental triggers [2, 3] leading to asthma exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are acute or subacute worsening episodes of shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness [4], which are classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening. These exacerbations may be associated with a variety of respiratory viruses, including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenzavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus [5], of which the first two mentioned groups are most importantly relevant to asthma development [6]. Viral respiratory infections are usually self-limiting illnesses [4]. However, they may exert profound effects on important aspects of asthma [7]. Studies suggest a substantial role for viral infections in about 50% of asthma exacerbations in adults and a greater involvement in childhood asthma exacerbations. Wheezing episodes in early life are associated with respiratory infections, which in most instances may diminish as the child ages [4].",

Because of the difficulty in differentiation of asthma from wheezing episodes of other origin in very young children, the patients enrolled in the study needed to comply with the diagnostic criteria of bronchial asthma according to the GINA guidelines [8]. Children with a history of premature birth and the presence of the pulmonary or cardiovascular system, metabolic disorders, immunosuppression, genetic, or neurologic disorders were excluded from the study.",

While viruses have been detected in up to 85% of asthma exacerbations in different studies [7, 16], in a study performed by Liao et al. [17] later, the rate of positive viral detection using PCR in acute asthma exacerbation was 34.2%. In this study, we could identify a potential viral causative agent as the reason of acute asthma exacerbation in 23 (38%) of our patients. This rate is in agreement with the one reported by Liao et al. [17]. This wide variation among asthmatic individuals in different studies may denote the influence of additional factors, such as the possible effect of atmospheric pollution in association with viral infections in inducing asthma attack.",

Rhinovirus is common in all age groups; RSV is most important in infants and younger children. Children affected with HRV tend to be older than those affected with RSV [18]. Jartti et al. suggested the transition in dominance between HRV and RSV around 12 months of age [19, 20]. This is in accordance with the results we obtained in this study. Therefore, we could explain the preponderance of HRV-induced asthma exacerbations in this study with the longer duration of exposure and also the low number of children less than 1 year of age enrolled in this study. The same results were also obtained in the COAST study, in which HRV was found in 48% of the samples and RSV in 21% of the specimens [6].",

For instance, the highest rates of virus detection are found when samples are taken as soon as symptoms commence. Viral detection becomes difficult by delaying the sampling at a time when virus shedding has been falling. Another limitation is the difficulty of diagnosing exacerbations in young children based on the clinical assessment of symptoms by both parents and clinicians. In addition, seasonal variations may significantly influence the virus identification. Extensive immunologic, virologic, and physiologic investigations during viral infections may lead toward the development of targeted therapy as a goal to personalize therapy for each asthmatic patient in the future.",
