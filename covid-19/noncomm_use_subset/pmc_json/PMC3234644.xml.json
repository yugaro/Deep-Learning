The animal\n            subsequently showed decreasing activity and recumbency, and so it was euthanized by\n            exsanguination via the carotid aorta under ketamine anesthesia. The procedures for\n            animal care and housing were in compliance with the institutional guidelines for the\n            care and use of laboratory animals. At necropsy, a white, quail egg-sized mass in the\n            mesentery, enlarged spleen and white foci in the lungs were found. After necropsy,\n            tissue samples from the mesenteric mass, liver, kidneys, heart, gastrointestine,\n            pancreas and urinary bladder were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin for\n            histological examination. The tissue samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin\n            wax, sectioned at 3 microns and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The sections of\n            the mesenteric mass, lung and spleen were also stained by the Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen and\n            periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) methods. For immunohistochemical examination, the sections of\n            the mesenteric mass were subjected to a labeled polymer method using Histofine Simple\n            Stain Rat MAX-PO (MULTI) (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for anti-mouse FCoV\n            (MCA2194, 1:100, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) and were counterstained with hematoxylin. For\n            electron microscopic examination, small pieces of the mass fixed in neutral buffered 10%\n            formalin were refixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and\n            routinely embedded in Epon resin. Ultra-thin sections of the selected areas were\n            prepared, contrasted with hafnium chloride and lead citrate and examined using a Hitachi\n            7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Tokyo, Japan).

Surrounding the granulomas, inflammatory cell\n            infiltration consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasmacytes was observed\n            diffusely and significantly. Aggregated plasma cells were also scattered around blood\n            vessels (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemistry revealed\n            positive reactions for anti-mouse FCoV in small numbers of macrophages around necrotic\n            foci (Fig. 4). Electron microscopic examination\n            revealed that the cytoplasm of the macrophages around necrotic foci contained enveloped\n            particles (Fig. 5). The particles, which were about\n            80 to 140 nm in diameter and had spike-like structures about 20 nm in length, were\n            identified as coronavirus (Fig. 6).
