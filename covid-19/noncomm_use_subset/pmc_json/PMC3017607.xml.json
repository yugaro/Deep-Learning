A similar approach can be applied to understand the mechanism of \u22121 PRF. The mechanistic model in the present study proposes that \u22121 PRF can occur during translocation and/or aa-tRNA accommodation. Figure 1 describes the overall framework using abc deX XXY YYZ fgh sequence as an example, where spaces separate zero frame codons and the slippery sequence is underlined. When \u22121 PRF occurs during translocation, the presence of the downstream stimulatory structure forces the ribosome to translocate by two, rather than three, bases toward the 3\u2032-end of the mRNA, thus shifting the reading frame. If this \u2018incomplete\u2019 translocation occurs to the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY, translation of the \u22121 frame begins at YYY. Alternatively, if incomplete translocation occurs to the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with XXY YYZ, translation of the \u22121 frame starts at Zfg. When \u22121 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA accommodation, the two tRNAs interacting with XXY YYZ slip to base pair with XXX YYY. Consequently, translation of \u22121 frame starts at Zfg (Figure 1).",

Translocation involves EF-G binding to the pre-translocational ribosome, GTP hydrolysis, unlocking conformation change, Pi release, tRNA movement, relocking conformation change and dissociation of EF-G from the post-translocational ribosome. This concept is illustrated along the top of Figure 2 from component PA (pre-translocational ribosome) to E0P0 (post-translocational ribosome). Detailed descriptions for each rate constant are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Selection and accommodation of aa-tRNA involves initial binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu:aa-tRNA:GTP, codon recognition, EF-Tu GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome and accommodation of the acceptor end of the aa-tRNA into the A-site or the rejection of the aa-tRNA by proofreading. Detailed descriptions for each rate constant are shown in Supplementary Table S2. In the absence of frameshifting, progression through these steps of the elongation cycle results in synthesis of the non-frameshift protein, called NFS (Figure 2).\n",

            "text": "Our kinetic model suggests three possible reaction pathways that could generate \u22121 frameshift proteins (Figure 2). In Pathway I, blockage of the mRNA channel entrance by the downstream stimulatory structure induces incomplete translocation with the pre-translocational ribosome positioned at deX XXY. Specifically, the reading frame shift occurs between the tRNA movement and Pi release (rate constant rTL0), and the relocking step (rate constant r45). Weiss et al. (23) suggested that when the two tRNAs move from P/E and A/P to the E/E and P/P states, they can un-pair from the mRNA and re-pair with the \u22121 reading frame. In our model, rt represents the rate constant for a ribosome:EF-G:GDP complex with two tRNAs in the E- and P-sites (E0P0EFGgdp) to re-pair with the \u22121 reading frame (E02P02EFGgdp). This motion is reversible, as denoted by the r\u2013t rate constant. This step is followed by a relocking conformational change and EF-G release from the ribosome complex. The resulting E0P0 or E02P02 (A-site unocupied) then moves on to the aa-tRNA selection step. Here, E0P0 is the post-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY (zero frame) and E02P02 is the post-translocational ribosome aligning with cde XXX (\u20131 frame), where subscript 0 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the zero frame; subscript 02 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the \u22121 frame. E0P0 may generate non-frameshift product NFS, or enter Pathway II or III described below. E02P02 can generate frameshift product FSm, which incorporates the \u22121 frame aa-tRNA in the recoding site (YYY). In addition, it is also possible for E02P02 to recruit a zero frame aa-tRNA for YYZ (A0) and accommodate this aa-tRNA into the \u22121 frame. In this case, frameshift product FSz, which incorporates the zero frame aa-tRNA in the recoding site (YYZ), is produced (Pathway Ia).",

Two parameters play important roles in Pathway I in the kinetic model. Here, rt represents the rate constant for incomplete translocation. An increase in rt while other parameters in the model remain constant leads to an increase in FS% (blue line in Figure 4a). Both the levels of FSm and FSz increase when rt increases (green and red lines in Figure 4a). Because the rise in the FSm level is larger, increasing rt results in a larger FSm fraction (Figure 4b). It is also interesting to note that the majority of FSz comes from Pathway III when rt is <2 s\u22121, while the majority of FSz is from pathway II when rt is >2 s\u22121 (Figure 4b). The rate constant r45 accounts for the relocking step during translocation. A decrease in r45 while other parameters in the model remain constant results in an increase in FS% (blue line in Figure 5a). Both the levels of FSm and FSz increase when r45 decreases (green and red lines in Figure 5a). However, in this case the increase in the FSm level is larger, leading to a larger FSm fraction with a decrease in r45 (Figure 5b). Here, the majority of FSz is from Pathway III when r45 is <22 s\u22121, but the majority of FSz results from pathway II when r45 becomes >22 s\u22121 (Figure 5b). These results suggest that translocation perturbations by either a downstream mRNA secondary structure, by mutations, or by chemical inhibitors may result in production of a higher FS%, primarily due to production of a larger amount of FSm. Notably, manipulating rt values causes larger changes in FS% and in the FSm fraction compared to the effect of r45, suggesting a dominant role by rt on \u22121 PRF in Pathway I. Consistent with our model, experimental studies demonstrated that mutating the E-site codon in the recoding site, or the use of a translocation inhibitor altered FS% (22).\n\n",

In addition, the single slippage model does not explain experimental evidence regarding the influence of translocation on \u22121 PRF (22,23). Our model suggests that in both mechanisms, incomplete translocation and slippage of P- and A-site tRNAs participate in synthesizing frameshift proteins to varying extents for different \u22121 PRF signals. Frameshifting at the HIV-1 sequence was reported to generate \u223c70% FSz and 30% FSm (1,25), indicating that Pathways II and/or III exert stronger influence on FS% than Pathway I. Notably, our protein analysis showed \u223c80% FSz and 20% FSm for the frameshifting signal in HIV-1 group M subtype B. This small discrepancy may due to the use of different reporter systems, or differences in the quantitative methods employed for the assay. For the HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift sequence, this study observed 39.4% FSm in total frameshift protein. This is the first study to demonstrate another frameshift sequence that generates a significant amount of FSm in addition to HIV-1. Interestingly, a small but observable lysine peak appeared at the corresponding position (\u20131 frame A-site codon in the recoding site) when HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift proteins were sequenced in the previous study (31), supporting the production of FSm. The stimulatory RNA of HTLV-1 pro-pol has been suggested to be a pseudoknot (31), although no direct evidence for the RNA structure was shown in the same study. Interestingly, the mouse Edr frameshift sequence, which shares high similarity with the HTLV-1 pro-pol sequence, was suggested to involve a pseudoknot (38). Because the length of HTLV-1 pro-pol stimulatory signals is not well-defined, the frameshift sequence incorporated in the TLV strain may not represent the whole stimulatory signal. However, the possible absence of a portion of the stimulatory signal did not prevent us from observing a significant amount of frameshift efficiency and the ratio of FSm to the total frameshift protein. Frameshift products from other \u22121 PRF signals were analysed previously (39,40). For SARS-CoV frameshifting, FSm was not found (39). However, for the Alphavirus coding sequence 6k, both FSz and FSm were identified in the frameshift products, although the exact ratio was not determined (40).",

For HIV-1 and HTLV-1, experimental results indicate that 20.4 and 39.4%, respectively, of frameshift proteins are FSm, i.e. the contribution of Pathway I. Although the experimental approach cannot differentiate between the relative contributions of Pathways II and III to FSz production, the kinetic model can be used to discriminate between the effects of these two pathways. In the kinetic model, rt, kpas2 and rt3 represent non-regular events, which are likely to be rate-limiting steps. These rate constants are thus expected to be small. The values for r45 and kpt are 5 and 50 s\u22121, respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). As shown in Figures 4\u20138, rt, r45, kpas2, and rt3 are all in the small value ranges, and kpt at 50 s\u22121, suggest that Pathway III contributes approximately equal or more to the FSz production than does Pathway II. Interestingly, inhibition of peptidyltransfer (decreasing kpt) can switch to a condition in which Pathway II contributes more to FSz production than Pathway III (Figure 8b). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the \u22121 PRF signals of different viruses have evolved within these kinetic parameters so as to produce the optimal ratios of shifted to unshifted products according to their specific biological requirements.",

Enhancing incomplete translocation in Pathway I promoted an increase in the fraction of FSm among total frameshift proteins. On the other hand, enhancing incomplete translocation in Pathway III decrease the fraction of FSm. While these two pathways were supported by previous studies, the direct observation of FSm for HIV-1 and HTLV-1 pro-pol frameshift sequences provided proof for the validity of Pathway I.

The creation of a favorable condition for one pathway can affect the composition of frameshift proteins significantly.

Our results suggest that not only the frameshift efficiency, but also the compositions of the frameshift products, are worth investigating to advance our knowledge of \u22121 PRF.",

Two translation elongation cycles are depicted at the top: the ribosome undergoes decoding (DC), aa-tRNA accommodation (AA), peptidyltransfer (PT) and translocation (TL) twice to add two amino acids into the polypeptide sequences. A shift in reading frame may occur at the first TL step and the ribosome decodes a \u22121 frame A-site codon at the recoding site. Additionally, \u22121 PRF may occur during the second AA step, in which the ribosome has decoded the zero frame A-site codon. Incorporation of the \u22121 reading frame aa-tRNA starts at the following cycle. Moreover, the shift in reading frame may occur at the second TL step and incorporation of the \u22121 reading frame aa-tRNA starts at the following cycle.",

Top: the procedure from PA to E0P0 represents translocation, which involves r1, r\u20131 (reversible EF-G binding), rTL0 (GTP hydrolysis, unlocking conformation change, tRNA movement and Pi release), and r45 (re-locking conformation change and EF-G dissociation). The E0P0 complex then undergoes aa-tRNA selection: from E0P0 to P0A0. The selection of aa-tRNA involves: k1, k\u20131 (reversible EF-Tu binding), k2, k\u20132 (reversible codon recognition), k345 (GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, EF-Tu conformation change and dissociation), and k6 (aa-tRNA rejection by proofreading), or k7 (aa-tRNA accommodation). The elongation cycle without a \u20131 PRF event results in synthesis of non-frameshift proteins (NFS). Pathway I in green suggests that \u20131 PRF occurs during the relocking step in the first translocation, leading to the formation of FSm. Pathway Ia indicates that the E02P02 complex may interact with a zero frame aa-tRNA and eventually produce FSz. Pathways II suggests that \u20131 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA selection and accommodation, resulting in FSz.
