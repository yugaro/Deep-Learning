Recently, the ZIKV has become a public health emergency, due to its rapid dissemination in the Americas and its unexpected link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome123. From epidemiological data, the ZIKV has been suspected to be the cause of the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in around 1 per 4,000 infected adults4. Moreover, a correlation between the ZIKV and testes infection/damage in the mouse model has been demonstrated, suggesting that the ZIKV infection, under certain circumstances, can bypass the blood-testis barrier and eventually lead to male infertility5. These findings highlight the importance of completely understanding the induction of protective or pathologic immune responses during a ZIKV infection.",

CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the capsid, envelope, and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have been observed in ZIKV-infected monkeys and humans678. In mice, several studies have indicated that CD8+ T cells play a protective role in controlling the ZIKV replication91011. Importantly, Jurado et al. demonstrated that a ZIKV infection results in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and perivascular infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells within the testes of Ifnar1-/- mice. Furthermore, they showed that CD8+ T cells instigate ZIKV-associated paralysis and appear to play a role in the neonatal brain immunopathology. In a previous study, we prepared the ZIKV-E294-302 tetramer and showed that ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cells exist in the brains and spinal cords of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1-/- mice, which may have important implications for the design and development of ZIKV vaccines10.",

The plasmid DNA vaccine is in phase 1 clinical trials12. The evaluation of safety and efficacy of ZIKV vaccines is, therefore, important. One advantage of the vaccines is their ability to elicit specific T-cell responses, which may be important for protection against the ZIKV. By using ZIKV-derived T-cell epitope-related tetramers, the T-cell immunoreactivity induced by an adenovirus-vector-based ZIKV vaccine could be detected in immunized mice, and both M and E glycoproteins were shown to induce robust antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell immunoreactivity13.",

This protocol describes the establishment of the Ifnar1-/- mouse model for ZIKV infections, and the detection of reactive T cells in the spleen, brain, and testes of the mice by using tetramer technology. Additionally, we used the ZIKV-E294-302 tetramer to detect and evaluate T-cell immunoreactivity induced by a ZIKV vaccine (AdC7-M/E) in immunized mice.

Pathological symptoms and signs (Figure 1A), as well as weight changes (Figure 1B), were observed in the Ifnar1-/- mice after an infection with the ZIKV. The murine brains showed obvious edema and hyperemia (Figure 1C). Meanwhile, the testes shrank gradually (Figure 1D). Furthermore, pathological changes and the destruction of tissue were found in the brain and testes (Figure 2A). We performed an immunofluorescence assay to detect the ZIKV in the brain and testes (Figure 2B). High viral loads were detected in the brain and testis by immunostaining (Figure 2B). Immunohistochemistry showed a robust infiltration of CD3+ T cells into the mice brain after the infection with the ZIKV (Figure 2C).",

The usage of tetramers to detect ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs would greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV infections and their host immune responses. Using E294-302 tetramer, virus-specific T cells in brain and testis can be isolated by flow cytometry, to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the protection and immunopathogenesis during a ZIKV infection.

Hence, the PE-labeled tetramer was used throughout this study.
