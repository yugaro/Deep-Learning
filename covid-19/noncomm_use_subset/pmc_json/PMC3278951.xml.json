Although the number of studies since the first description of HBoV is increasing, many of these studies are retrospective on stored samples, or only on samples negative for other pathogens, or on samples collected during a few months and thus suffering from the bias that sampling may be guided from the occurrence of RSV or influenza epidemics.

However, frequency of HBoV infection was found to be relatively low in children younger than 6 months, and the possibility of passive protection due to maternal antibodies has been questioned. These findings together with the high prevalence rates in young children led to the hypothesis that HBoV may be an endemic virus with high attack rates in those susceptible; one would then expect that the majority of the population would be infected during childhood. In support of this hypothesis are the high seroprevalence rates against HBoV reported in the adult population [23]. The mere presence of HBoV in the airway may not be able to define its role as a pathogen; therefore it is anticipated that serology would be a useful diagnostic addition to the study of HBoV infection.",

Similar findings were reported in other studies, where co-infection was found in one third of patients [5, 24], while other investigators have reported even higher rates [8, 15, 25]. It has been hypothesized that detection of HBoV asymptomatic presence may be enhanced by the symptoms caused by another virus or that HBoV may aggravate the clinical course of symptoms due to other viral infections, so that it is frequently detected in hospitalized children [26]. Co-infection is frequently described with many respiratory viruses and the question whether this may result in more serious clinical outcomes has not been clarified [27].",

Another 2 of our patients presented with laryngotracheobronchitis, a finding which is in accordance with the study of Rihkanen et al. [29]. Only 1 of our patients returned for follow-up and a second throat swab sample, taken 20 days after the first one, was found negative for HBoV DNA. Our findings suggest that HBoV may have similar clinical features to those of other respiratory viruses such as RSV. One may argue that the fact that HBoV is prevalent in samples from patients with respiratory tract infection does not guarantee a causative role for the symptoms, especially when \u2013 as in this case \u2013 it is frequently detected in combination with other respiratory viruses of known pathogenic potential. On the other hand, HBoV was rarely detected in asymptomatic children [16, 22].",
