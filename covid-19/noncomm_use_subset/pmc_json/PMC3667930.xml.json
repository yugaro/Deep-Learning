It has also been proved a number of times1,2 that influenza is responsible for increased recourse to general medical care, increases in hospitalisations and excess mortality.1,2 On the basis of the US population in 2003, Molinari et al. estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in average direct medical costs of $10.4 billion and average indirect costs of $16.3 billion.3 The estimated costs of seasonal epidemics from 1999\u20132008 in Italy ranged from \u20ac1.5 to \u20ac2.0 billion per year, and the costs of the H1N1/09 pandemic ranged from \u20ac1.3 to \u20ac2.3 billion.4",

The most important one is that these studies have usually been conducted independently of repeated yearly vaccinations, and of the type, dosage, timing or administration schedule of the various influenza vaccines. Furthermore, the authors have completely ignored the technological evolution of influenza vaccines during the study period (such as techniques for determining the antigen dose, introduction of national and international quality control, etc). In addition, when studies of different power and with different specific outcomes are combined and considered equally, the results are difficult to interpret and often inconclusive.38,39",

The reasons for this could be: (1) the very good matching between vaccine and circulating influenza strains; (2) the fact that the elderly, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, had probably had previous contact with an H1N1 strain closely related to the A/California/07/09pdm virus, as was demonstrated by the very low morbidity in these subjects during the 2009/10 pandemic season4 and as was confirmed by the study by Hancock et al., who reported high percentages of neutralizing antibody titers against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus among serum donors born before 1950.41 Thus, the 2010\u201311 vaccination might have had a potent booster action: indeed, there are studies that support our hypothesis;42,43 (3) the stimulating action by the adjuvants of the vaccines studied.",

Furthermore in occasion of annual influenza vaccination campaign, it is useful to vaccinate the elderly against pneumococcal infections. Indeed, the synergism between influenza infection and a greater susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae is well established.45 With regard to this item, our results also demonstrate that vaccination against S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent among controls than cases, although the pneumococcal vaccination status of many subjects, both cases and controls, could not be ascertained.",
