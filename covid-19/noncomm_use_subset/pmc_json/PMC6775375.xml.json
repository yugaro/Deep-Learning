            "text": "As a result of socioeconomic development and growing interest in travel, the number of South Koreans traveling abroad has increased markedly over the past 10 years. Between 2008 and 2018 the number of international travelling tripled from 9.5 million to 29 million in Korea,[1] and this upward trend is expected to be continued. With this increase in international travel, more people are thus exposed to a variety of health risks such as injuries and infectious diseases while traveling abroad. For example, the 2015 Korea outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, which resulted in 186 cases including 38 fatalities was initiated from a returning traveler from the Middle East.[2,3] Generally, travel is associated with unfamiliar environments such as sudden changes in temperature, traffic rules, food culture, and exposure to a variety of infectious diseases that can result in hospitalization abroad. Nevertheless, many people often travel without travel insurance that protects them, including financially, in case of medical emergencies overseas,[4\u20136] assuming \u201cit will not happen to me\u201d. Hospitalization abroad may involve considerable medical costs accrued within a short time, and communication may also be a problem. Most patients wish to return home quickly, but it can be delayed due to poor transportation systems and/or lack of specialized escort teams.[7] Despite increasing number of Korean travelers hospitalized abroad and transferred home by aeromedical team, there have been no studies investigating the medical transportation of Korean travelers from foreign countries. In this study, we analyzed the transportation experiences of Korean travelers who suffered accidents abroad and were then transferred home by our aeromedical team.",

            "text": "Several problems arise when transporting patients back to South Korea. First, it is illegal for Korean doctors to engage in medical activities in foreign countries. Thus, after obtaining permission from the hospital and the airline, domestic medical personnel and equipment should be prepared. Such preparation should include access to information about the patient's condition and ability to synchronize the flight schedule of the patient with availability of medical personnel. Also, the domestic hospital receiving the patient must be identified. An air ambulance with dedicated equipment and medical staff is the fast and efficient mode of international medical transportation, but extremely expensive (5\u201310-fold the cost of other transportation modes). In previous studies, the main causes of death among travelers were conditions associated with age, cardiovascular disease, and motor vehicle traffic accidents.[8\u201313] Marine sports\u2013related injuries were the next most common cause, but the most common cause of all traumas, including death, was pedestrian accidents.[6,14\u201316] According to our research, air ambulances are very effective for seriously injured patients who require intensive care, and the cost of this service can be reduced if specialists operate portable intensive care equipment. In this study, an air ambulance was used twice, once upon the aggressive insistence of a family member and once when a patient was in shock. However, 12 patients who had received recommendations from foreign hospitals for air ambulance transport were successfully transferred just with stretcher of flight without fatal outcomes, because our portable equipment was adequate. These patients had already undergone all required operations, had stable vital signs, and were not in shock. The transfer time of air ambulance had been increased by not only the need to refuel often due to the small size of airplanes, but also transit problems due to use of airplane of nearby country caused by absence of airplane in patient's located country. The costs and durations of stretcher and prestige transport differed minimally when regular passenger planes were used. A stretcher required 6 economy seats. Given the 2 accompanying medical personnel, the cost of the 8 seats was almost the same as that of 3 seats in using prestige. Ship was the least expensive mode of transportation, and it was also much less stressful than air transport; however, the transfer time for this mode was very long. The ship also had certain disadvantages: the boarding time was very long, and motion adversely affected both the patients and the medical personnel. It should be noted that a short transfer time is very important for seriously ill patients. As in earlier studies, 5 patients received a recommendation to travel by ship because of the pressure problems expected after neurosurgical operations in foreign hospitals.[17,18] However, patients who underwent procedures such as vascular clipping who had experienced 3 postsurgical days without incident did not develop complications during transfer. Arranging transport prior to surgery and establishing good communication with local staff are crucial to ensuring that patients are transported as safely and quickly as possible. These arrangements also reduce costs. The most important obstacles in this process are the refusal by foreign hospitals to release patients and the refusal by airlines to let patients fly. Of course, the patients\u2019 state of consciousness also affects the transfer time, which is associated with the abovementioned problems. However, as consciousness changes over time, it may be inappropriate to decide whether to transfer a patient by reference to only 1 symptom. We found that the required approvals followed when we personally called the medical staff of foreign hospitals or visited the hospitals; under such conditions, the obstacles vanished. Therefore, directly contacting and communicating with the specialized staff of foreign hospitals is essential for reducing unnecessary overseas hospital stays and costs. One limitation of this study was small number of cases. This is the first study on this topic in South Korea and has contributed to our establishment of a system to transport seriously ill or injured South Korean patients back to Korea.",
