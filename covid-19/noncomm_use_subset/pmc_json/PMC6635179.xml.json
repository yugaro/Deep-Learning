The \u201cIngelfinger rule,\u201d created in 1969 by the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, was originally designed to protect the journal from publishing unoriginal articles. The subsequent editor encouraged this rule specifically to discourage public disclosure of research results in a nonscientific forum before the peer-review process.1 However, the value of prepublication data, and the harms and benefits it may pose, were widely discussed even before the public spread of social media. A key example is Mayo Clinic\u2019s 1997 prepublication release of data linking fenfluramine-phentermine (\u201cfen-phen\u201d) to severe cardiac valvular disease.18 The New England Journal of Medicine waived the Ingelfinger rule and allowed a large-scale public press conference releasing the prepublication data specifically due to the immediate implications for the health of patients taking fen-phen,7 which ultimately proved correct after peer review and publication. Publication of the data only took 7 weeks, but in that time frame, clinical practices rapidly changed, and the drugs were widely deprescribed.",

In 1985, the French Ministry of Social Affairs held a press conference based on prepublication data, stating that cyclosporine immunosuppression was an effective treatment for AIDS.1 This was widely distributed in the popular press, but final data did not ultimately support the conclusion, and patients were inappropriately treated with agents that hastened the disease. Legal issues also arose when ICN Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of ribavirin, called a prepublication press conference to discuss findings that suggested ribavirin as a successful treatment for HIV.1 This was followed by a significant jump in stock price. The FDA then published a statement contradicting the report.19 A series of legal battles led to the company\u2019s dissolution in the early 2000s.20",

The medical literature has limited discussion of this phenomenon. However, publications in biology4,12 and the life sciences13 cover the topic extensively, in part due to the enormous surge in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 publications and a recent scandal in which multiple simultaneous developers of CRISPR technology were scooped.25 The literature suggests that scooping not only does not harm the reputation of the authors, but also adds depth and validity to publications of both the scooped and the scooper, while adding a broader perspective to the problem. Even journals with extremely high-impact factors, such as Nature, suggest that although scooping is an author concern, it rarely has a negative impact on the original author, and prereleased data encourage other authors to investigate and publish related material.14 The phenomenon has been extensively discussed and computationally analyzed in the social sciences literature,5 which suggests that variation in scooping and data sharing is highly dependent on the cultural norms of specific fields, but there is little negative impact. In fact, many journals now have \u201ccomplementary research\u201d policies that specifically prevent the scooped publication from languishing.15",
