These sensitive techniques have enabled detection of viruses in up to 92% of respiratory specimens of children with pneumonia.8\u201312 Many of the commonly detected respiratory viruses and bacteria are also detected in the nasopharynx of apparently healthy children, obscuring their exact contribution to childhood pneumonia.9 11 13\u201315 Except for influenza vaccine, no licensed vaccines for common respiratory viruses are currently available although a number of vaccines for other respiratory viruses are in clinical trials.16\u201318\n",

However, high vaccine coverage has almost eliminated pathogenic vaccine-type strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in this population.6 23 While there were no differences overall, S. pneumoniae was detected more frequently among infants with pneumonia than in control infants, suggesting S. pneumoniae may remain as an important cause of pneumonia in early life. While our results suggest a lesser contribution of bacteria to childhood pneumonia than viruses, we caution that we have not disproved an important role for bacteria. It is plausible, for example, that secondary bacterial infection plays an important role in many cases of viral pneumonia.34\n",

To detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, we collected biological specimens from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx). The diagnosis of probable infectious agents associated with the lower respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia in children is often based on minimally invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates or nose/throat swabs.9 46 Testing of specimens from usually sterile sites (including blood and pleural fluid for culture or PCR) is available in our setting but was not mandated by our protocol. It is to be noted that while detecting a pathogen in the upper respiratory tract is not conclusive of its causal association with disease; however, testing control children without pneumonia enabled us to have a better estimation on contribution to pneumonia at the population level. Our ability to identify respiratory pathogens associated with pneumonia was limited by the sensitivity of testing the specimens from nasopharynx for infection in the lower airways. Differences between pathogen detection in the upper and lower tract have been shown previously47; it is plausible that in some cases with detectable virus, shedding of virus from the nasopharynx might be insignificant, or that shedding might be waning by the time children are hospitalised with pneumonia. Because of the sensitivity of our testing methods is likely incomplete, we expect that these estimates of the contribution of viruses to pneumonia represent minimum estimates. We used qualitative PCR assays in this study; determination of pathogen density through quantitative assays may permit distinction of causative from coincidental infection in particular cases of pneumonia.48 We did not collect but data on radiographic details, for example, lobar consolidation or intestinal infiltrate, of enrolled cases would be useful to assess if radiographic pattern is associated with pathogen (bacterial or viral or both) detected in nasopharynx.",

The burden of HMPV pneumonia may have been underappreciated before now.
