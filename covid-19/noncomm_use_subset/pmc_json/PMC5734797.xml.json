It is a white or slightly yellow crystalline powder with bitter taste. It is a lysosomotropic weak base, soluble in water at pH 4.5 with molecular formula of C18H26CIN3. The derivatives of CQ includes chloroquine diphosphate (C18H29ClN3.2H3PO4), chloroquine phosphate (C18H29ClN3.H3PO4), chloroquine sulfate (C18H26ClN3. H2SO4) and chloroquine dihydrochloride (C18H26ClN3.2HCl) [1]. CQ has been used as a primary antimalarial drug since 1930s due to its tolerability, effectiveness against malaria and inexpensive synthesis [2]. In addition to serving as a malarial drug, CQ is now used in cancer therapy due to its enhancement property against tumour activity [3]. CQ is also shown to significantly improve insulin levels in type 2 diabetes (T2D) [4]. In addition CQ is used as an antifungal [5], it is used in the treatment of rheumatic and immune-mediated diseases [6], management of HIV, SARS-CoV and influenza A/H5N1 virus [7].",

In addition, CQ treatment during pregnancy is extremely toxic to embryo and overdose could lead to death [8]. The negative effect of CQ is due to the fact that it inhibits diastolic depolarization, which slows down conduction and alters the intracellular transport of ionic transport. It also inhibits glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, enzyme synthesis in nucleic acids; cyclic AMP pathway and it also increase oxidative stress in the organs [1], [9]. Due to its high affinity towards nucleates and nucleoproteins, CQ could accumulate in lysosomes, adrenal glands and in epithelial cells of kidney which alters the secretion of aldosterone [10].",

Specifically fish bioassay is considered as crucial in the field of eco-toxicology. As fish are one of the most organisms of the aquatic food web, and as they are a chief sources of food all over the world and as they are highly sensitive to slight environmental changes [15], [16] it is important to conduct fish bioassay. Bioassays play an important role in providing information about the impact of emerging chemicals [17]. In addition to bioassay, biomarkers are considered as early warning signals in the field of environment risk assessment. The biomarker response reveals the health status of an organism, population and ecosystem [18]. Biochemical and histological biomarkers are known to be sensitive tools to detect direct effects of pollutants in the specific organ [19]. These biomarkers may provide information from the starting point of biological effects to the impact on cell physiology [20].",

            "text": "Among the biochemical biomarkers enzymes are commonly used as a marker of pathological alterations of the organ, as they rapidly respond to chemicals. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT or AST), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT or ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the enzymes found in heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscles and erythrocytes. GOT and GPT participate in transamination reactions. Likewise, LDH is an oxidative enzyme which is important for glycolytic activity. The alterations in these enzymes are used as organ health indicators of chemical exposure. GOT, GPT and LDH are widely used enzymological parameters in toxicology and in clinical chemistry to know the status of organs [21]. Similarly, histopathological changes provide the direct effects of the toxicant in organs [22] and also reveal the difference between damage induced by toxicant and other factors in organs/tissues [23]. In fish, gills are the primary site of toxicant exposure and their structural changes indicate the impact of toxicant. Liver is the second largest organ in the body and are known to be a defense organ. Antoine et al. [24] reported that liver is the major target area of human pharmaceuticals. Likewise kidney is a target organ for many pharmaceutical drugs. Hence, histological observation of vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney are important biomarkers in determining the toxic effect of human pharmaceuticals.",

Even though their concentrations in the aquatic environment are low (ng L\u22121 to \u03bcg L\u22121) [11], they could have adverse effects on the aquatic biota. The first report on occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment was reported by Garrison et al. [29]. Recently many reports on the effects of pharmaceuticals on non-target organisms such as freshwater mussel [30], fish [17], [31], cladocerans [32], prawn [33], micro alga [34], and invertebrates [35] have been studied. Acute toxicity tests of chemical on organisms are related to non-specific mode of actions, but it provides rapid responses at short duration [16], [21]. The reports and data on acute ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals on non-target organisms alone could not fulfil the risk assessment [36]. In this line sub lethal toxicity test are important management tool to measure the long term effect of toxicants at low concentration of chemical.",

Acute toxicity data will be useful only when there will be accidental discharge of drugs [37], in which there will be no mortality in the organism but morphological, behavioural and metabolic alterations could occur. The data on acute toxicity of chloroquine to aquatic organisms are very limited. Zurita et al. [38] reported that the 48 h median effective concentration (EC50) of CQ to Daphnia magna, Chlorella vulgaris, fish cells from Poeciliopsis lucida and the bacterium Vibrio fischeri was 9, 27, 43 and 126 mg/L respectively. Similarly Rendal et al. [39] reported that the toxicity of CQ to Salix viminalis and Daphnia magna was more at pH 9 than at pH 6 indicating that the toxicity of CQ depends on the pH of the media. In the present study the 96 h LC 50 of CQ to C. carpio was found to be 31.32 mg/ml. Our result more or less similar to reports reported on the LC 50 of other pharmaceutical drugs such as sulfadimethoxine, carbamazepine, propranolol, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, levofloxacin, triclosan to O. latipes was >100, 35.4, 11.40, >100, 8.04, >100 and 0.60 mg/l, respectively [40], [41]. Similarly, Henschel et al. [42] reported the LC 50 of paracetamol to B. rerio was 378 mg/l and clofibric acid to D. rerio was 86 mg/l.",

CQ binds with DNA and inhibits the metabolic functions, interfere with haemoglobin and it also causes cell mediated death [6]. Similar to our findings MacPhee and Ruelle [44] observed mortality of fish salmon upon exposure to 20 \u03bcM of CQ, whereas only behavioural changes were noticed in rainbow trout exposed to 388 \u03bcM of CQ after 24 h [45].

In the present investigation GOT, GPT and LDH activity in plasma of fish was altered during acute and sublethal exposure. Van der et al. [46] stated that changes in the activity of plasma GOT and GPT act as a sensitive indicator to know the health status of organs of fish exposed to chemicals. Decrease in transaminase activity was due to the deficiency of amino acids and reduction of \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid. When there is minor cell damage, the enzyme activity may increase in the blood (extracellular fluid) [21]. Increase in plasma GOT and GPT activity is an indication of functional damage of muscular, hepatic, and renal cell damage. However, GOT and GPT levels in an organism is depends on the protein and carbohydrate metabolism [47]. Any changes in the protein and carbohydrate metabolism may also leads to a change in the transaminase activity. In the present study also the accumulation of CQ in tissues/organs leads to damage of these organs which results release of these enzymes in to blood. In general an increase in transaminases activity indicates tissue damage whereas the inhibition of these enzymes indicates disturbance in the structure of cell organelles or death of cell organelles. The inhibition of lysosomal functions in PLHC-1 cell lines may be due to selective accumulation of CQ in the lysosomes [38]. Tetrameric enzyme, LDH is located in the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the energy metabolism under oxygen demand. Alteration in LDH activity indicates the release of isozymes from damaged cells, changes in protein and carbohydrate metabolism and leakage from white muscle and red blood cells [47], [46]. Furthermore changes in the activity of LDH could be used as a good marker of membrane permeability and apoptosis [48]. In the present study the significant increase in LDH activity during acute study indicate impaired carbohydrate metabolism caused by the drug chloroquine. However, the observed increase of LDH activity during sublethal treatment might have resulted from tissue damage due to accumulation and toxicity of CQ. In the present study, the alterations in the GOT, GPT and LDH activities clearly indicate that the fish is under stress condition. Alterations in GOT,GPT and LDH activity has been reported in L. rohita exposed to selenium [21], D. magna exposed to carbamazepine [48], C. carpio exposed to clofibric acid and diclofenac [49] and in C. mrigala exposed to ibuprofen [50]. The alteration in these enzyme activities are generally used as sensitive biomarkers for the monitoring of xenobiotics in the aquatic environment. Zurita et al. [38] reported a dose dependent inhibition of total protein content and significant increase in SOD and G6PDH activities in PLHC-1 cells due to CQ toxicity. In the present study also the alterations of the GOT, GPT and LDH activities during acute and sublethal toxicity depends on the dose and exposure period.",

But in the CQ treated group several anomalies such as LF, DN, OE, V, HP, BC, EL, HT, F, C and DQ were occurred. Exposure of fish to xenobiotics could cause various anomalies in the gill morphology [52]. Nascimento et al. [53] observed structural alterations in the fish Oligosarcus hepsetus, Hypostomus auroguttatus and Geophagus brasiliensis collected from the polluted Para\u0131ba do Sul River.",

Likewise, epithelial lifting and hypertrophy may occur by the formation of edema and induced proliferation of cellular component (endoplasmic reticulum) respectively [55]. These changes in the gill morphology may inhibit the entry of xenobiotics into the fish. Morphological alterations in the gill lamellae could cause blood congestion (BC) in the gill of fish exposed to toxic substance [56]. Vacuolisation and lamellar fusion could occur as a response of stress condition, which may disrupt the normal physiological function in fish [57]. Fish in the highly polluted environment could have necrosis in their gill morphology as a result of direct effect of toxicant [58]. In the present study the alterations in the gill morphology may leads to entry of CQ which may disrupt the respiratory mechanism and adverse effects.",
