The staff at the school clinic initially assumed that the October\u2013November AFI peaks reflected recurrence of CHIKV. However, at laboratory analysis we identified a cluster of DENV1 cases, followed by a small ZIKV cluster in December [14]. However, we were not able to find an cause for the majority of AFI cases in this time period, despite the use of viral culture techniques; work on identification of other possible etiologic agents for AFI cases in this time period continues. Finally, the January 2015 peak seems to have been due largely to an outbreak of DENV4 infection.",

In December 2013, CHIKV infections were confirmed for the first time in the western hemisphere [4, 25]. It is clear from our study, and other longitudinal studies [7, 26], that as the epidemic moved through islands and countries it was the dominant cause of AFI for a period of 2\u20134 months. However, in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies [7, 26, 27], what also emerges is a more complex picture of a m\u00e9lange of arboviral infections, with frequent coinfections and cases and case clusters attributable to other viruses surrounding the CHIKV epidemic peak. In Haiti, in contrast to other studies that relied on serologic assays, we performed actual viral cultures on a majority of case patients; findings further underscored the extent of coinfections [19], and resulted in the identification of \u201cunexpected\u201d viruses, such as ZIKV and MAYV. It remains to be seen what impact this mix of infections has on host susceptibility and disease occurrence and severity [28, 29].",
