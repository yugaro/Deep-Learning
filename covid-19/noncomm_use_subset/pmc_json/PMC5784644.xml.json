            "text": "Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer of the genitourinary tract in Korea and worldwide [1,2]. Urothelial carcinomas represent more than 90% of BC and are classified into non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle invasive BC according to depth of invasion. Majority of patients with BC are diagnosed with NMIBC [3], and it is treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) with/without intravesical treatment. However, despite complete removal of NMIBC by TURBT, significant proportions of patients undergo tumor recurrence ranging from 15% to 90% within 5 years [4-6]. In addition to frequent tumor recurrence, clinical practice (including regular cystoscopy follow-up and intravesical treatment) may be associated with various side effects and patient morbidity, which consequently result in decreased patient quality of life (QOL). Thus, reliable and valid measure of such patient QOL is becoming important assessment of clinical outcomes as the issues of disease-free and BC-specific survival and would form the basis for the research and development of better BC treatment methods [7].",

[8] validated a module specific for NMIBC, EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaire in 2014. This questionnaire is a self-administered, multidimensional instrument exploring QOL of NMIBC patients in six scales (urinary symptom, malaise, future worries, bloating and flatulence, sexual function, and male sexual problems) and five single items (intravesical treatment issues, sexual intimacy, risk of contaminating a partner, sexual enjoyment, and female sexual problems). However, its applicability in different countries except an original European study [8] has not been reported. In this study, we developed a Korean version of QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaire, and evaluated its psychometric properties to determine if it is appropriate for evaluating the outcomes of Korean NMIBC patients.",

Forward translation of the questionnaire from English into Korean was independently conducted by two translators (two MDs) who are fluent in both English and Korean. Reconciliation of the two versions was made at the first consensus meeting among the translators and two main investigators (J.P. and D.W.S.) with a good command of English, yielding a first consensus Korean version. Such reconciled version was then back translated by two independent translators (a PhD in psychology and an English teacher), bilingual in English and Korean, without referring original English questionnaire. A second consensus meeting was held between the translators and two main investigators (J.P. and D.W.S.), during which the original and two back-translated versions were compared and their discordances were debated. At this meeting, we decided that several questions needed slight modification due to linguistic reason and cultural background, and made a revision of the first consensus version.",

Third, the responsiveness to change over time was evaluated using the three sets of QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaires (baseline, post-TURBT 3 and 6 months). Paired t tests for matched sample were used to determine the significance of change.

Low response rate to sexual intimacy scale, risk of contaminating a partner scale, and sexual enjoyment scale reflects that many patients were not actively engaged in sexual activity. This could be largely explained by the old age of the BC patients but also reflect loss of sexual interest and fear of contaminating partner after the BC diagnosis and early survivorship period after treatment. It was difficult to determine the true missing rate for those three sexual items, because less than half of patients reported that they had been sexually active during the study period. If limited to patients who reported at least a little sexual activity (item 48) at the each time point, completion rate was around 75% (Table 2). Our finding is also consistent with the original European validation study [8], in which around half of patients reported at least a little sexual activity, and completion rates for the sexual scales and items was > 75% if limited to those who have any sexual activity. High missing rate of female sexual problem scale is in line with our previous experience with validation of Korean version of EORTC QLQ CX24 (cervical cancer) module [12], which revealed relatively low compliance with regard to sexuality-related scales (around 40% of missing rates).",

However, for the malaise scale, the alpha coefficients were below the 0.70 level (0.26 to 0.44), suggesting heterogeneity of the items in the scale (Table 3). Similar to our finding, internal consistency of the malaise scale in the original European study was low (0.57 at visit 1, 0.58 at visit 2, and 0.64 at visit 3). We also observed suboptimal item discriminate validity for two items in the malaise scale (item 38 and 39). For example, the item on fever (item 38) correlated more highly with bloating and flatulence scale than with the feeling ill or unwell item (item 39) in its own scale. Item on feeling ill or unwell (item 39) also correlated more highly with other scales, such as urinary symptom, intravesical treatment, future worries, and bloating and flatulence. Very low mean score (floor effect) and non-specificity of the symptom in this scale might be the reason for this finding.",

This finding may be because BC can cause various urinary symptoms [13] and urinary tract infection-like symptoms at diagnosis [14] but such symptoms generally improve after TURBT. However, urinary symptoms at post-TURBT visits (3 and 6 months) in UK patients of the original manuscript [8] did not differ from baseline, while malaise significantly deteriorated compared to baseline. We think that higher proportions of patients undergoing intravesical treatment, which was frequently associated with various symptoms including urinary symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, etc.) and malaiselike symptoms, in the original study (100% compared to 37.4% in our study population) might affect their findings, although further studies in another patient cohorts are needed to elucidate exact reasons of these inconsistent findings in urinary symptoms and malaise. Meanwhile, future worries significantly improved after treatment, reflecting improvement of well-known psychological distress after diagnosis of BC [15,16], consistent with an original study [8]. NMIBC patients are reported to have sexual dysfunction including sexual inactivity and fear about contaminating partner with treatment agents [17]. Interestingly, risk of contaminating a partner gradually improved over time (between visits 2 and 3), whereas sexual function showed a decreasing tendency after treatment. No difference was observed in other scales except aforementioned scales until 6 months, similar to an original study [8], in which most scales and items did not significantly change before and after treatment except for three scales (malaise, future worries, and bloating and flatulence).",
