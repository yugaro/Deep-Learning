Promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) cells is an area of intense interest as a means to enhance remyelination (Kremer, Kury, & Dutta, 2015). Differentiation within the oligodendrocyte lineage is regulated by complex mechanisms that work together to accomplish derepression of myelin genes (Liu & Casaccia 2010). Many components involved in these processes have been identified but the molecular interactions are not yet fully understood. Moreover, mechanisms may be modulated in different contexts, such as developmental myelination, myelin remodeling in normal adults, or remyelination in adult pathology.",

Multiple transcription factors that regulate OP differentiation can interact with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), including leukemia/lymphoma\u2010related factor (LRF), myelin transcription factor 1, and Yin\u2010Yang1 (Armstrong, Kim, & Hudson, 1995; Dobson, Moore, Tobin, & Armstrong, 2012; He, Sandoval, & Casaccia\u2010Bonnefil, 2007; Liu et al., 2004; Nielsen, Berndt, Hudson, & Armstrong, 2004; Romm, Nielsen, Kim, & Hudson, 2005). Each of these potential transcriptional repressors exhibits stage\u2010specific expression within the oligodendrocyte lineage. In addition, HDAC1 represses the transcription factor Hes5 to promote OP differentiation and mediate derepression of myelin genes (Liu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008).",

Hes5 is progressively down\u2010regulated during OP differentiation yet elevated in demyelinated lesions in which remyelination is limited, such as in chronic lesions of multiple sclerosis (John et al., 2002; Kondo & Raff, 2000; Liu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 1998).",

            "text": "LRF warrants particular interest as a potential point of intersection between HDAC1 promoter regulation and notch signaling. LRF has been referred to as the \u201cmost exciting yet enigmatic\u201d member of the POK/ZBTB family of transcription factors, which generally act as transcriptional repressors (Lunardi, Guarnerio, Wang, Maeda, & Pandolfi, 2013). The 43 known members of this protein family contain a POK/BTB domain at the N terminus, which mediates protein\u2010protein interactions, while the C terminus contains multiple Kruppel\u2010type zinc fingers that bind DNA. The gene zinc finger and BTB domain\u2010containing protein 7A (Zbtb7a) encodes the protein referred to as LRF (mouse), OCZF (rat), or FBI\u20101 (human) and will be referred to as LRF here. LRF binds corepressors and recruits HDAC1 to gene targets with consensus LRF binding sites (Liu et al., 2004; Lunardi, Guarnerio, Wang, Maeda, & Pandolfi, 2013). LRF plays a critical role in promoting differentiation of B cells by suppressing Notch1 signals that instruct differentiation along the T cell lineage (Lee et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2007). In multiple cell lines, LRF also interacts with sterol regulatory element\u2010binding protein (SREBP) to synergistically activate transcription of fatty acid synthase (FASN), which is essential for phospholipids in myelin and cell membranes (Choi et al., 2008). In OP cells, SREBPs are important regulators of oligodendrocyte maturation and FASN levels (Monnerie et al., 2017). However, LRF activity can be stage\u2010specific as shown for transcriptional regulation in the osteoclast lineage and also for fetal to adult type globin gene expression in erythroid cells (Masuda et al., 2016; Tsuji\u2010Takechi et al., 2012). Indeed, among hematopoietic lineages, LRF regulates differentiation by complexing with different key factors in a tissue\u2010 and context\u2010dependent manner (Lunardi et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In the brain and spinal cord, LRF is strongly expressed in the nuclei of oligodendrocytes as well as in diverse neuronal populations (Dobson, Moore, Tobin, & Armstrong, 2012). LRF expression in these post\u2010mitotic neural cells in the normal postnatal and adult CNS contrasts with the pro\u2010mitotic role of LRF in cancer (Lee & Maeda, 2012). LRF expression co\u2010localized with NeuN in nuclei of both large motor neurons in the ventral horn and small sensory dorsal horn neurons, as well as in multiple neuronal populations distinguished by their size and laminar distribution in the cerebral cortex (Dobson et al., 2012). In white matter of the postnatal spinal cord, LRF was expressed in only about 10% of OP cells in contrast to over 70% expression of LRF in oligodendrocytes (Dobson et al., 2012). Regardless of lineage stage, LRF was localized in nuclei. In vitro, viral transduction of LRF promoted OP differentiation, while LRF knockdown impaired OP differentiation (Dobson et al., 2012). Furthermore, in vivo deletion of LRF inhibited OP differentiation and the generation of mature oligodendrocytes during postnatal myelination (Dobson et al., 2012).",

Given the context\u2010dependent activity of LRF noted above in other cell types, we characterize LRF expression using a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) model to produce focal demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord with gliosis, inflammation, and breakdown of the blood\u2010brain barrier that reflects the complex pathology of multiple sclerosis lesions (Armstrong, Redwine, & Messersmith, 2005; Messersmith, Murtie, Le, Frost, & Armstrong, 2000; Redwine & Armstrong, 1998; Vana, Lucchinetti, Le, & Armstrong, 2007b). We cross floxed Zbtb7a mice with Plp/CreER\nT and NG2CreER\nT lines for tamoxifen\u2010induced conditional deletion of LRF in oligodendrocyte lineage cells following cuprizone demyelination. We have previously used this system with the cuprizone model to identify molecular interactions contributing to effective remyelination (Zhou, Pannu, Le, & Armstrong, 2012). In vitro promoter assays demonstrate the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin genes and notch target genes during OP differentiation. Our studies demonstrate that LRF expression in the oligodendrocyte lineage is mainly found in oligodendrocytes during remyelination and that LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination.",

OP cells were immunolabeled with an antibody to the external domain of NG2 (Goretzki, Burg, Grako, & Stallcup, 1999; Jones, Yamaguchi, Stallcup, & Tuszynski, 2002).

Figures were prepared as panels using Adobe Photoshop (RRID: SCR_014199). In transverse spinal cord sections, quantification areas were delimited as white matter areas with demyelination identified by MOG or CNP immunostaining and matched to the same anatomical area in the control mice. In the coronal sections of corpus callosum, the myelinated area was estimated from MOG immunolabeling, as previously detailed (Armstrong, Le, Flint, Vana, & Zhou, 2006). MetaMorph Image Analysis Software (RRID: SCR_002368; Molecular Devices) was used to threshold pixels as above baseline for positive myelin staining within the section. Within each area of spinal cord or corpus callosum, all labeled cells were counted manually with a 40x objective lens. Spot Advanced Software (RRID: SCR_014313; Spot Imaging Solutions) was used to measure the area of each region\u2010of\u2010interest. As noted in the figure legends, three sections per mouse were analyzed for three or more mice in each condition, and quantifications were performed blinded to the condition. By dividing the firefly reading by the reading of the Renilla control for each OP culture experiment, three biological\u2010replicate samples from each condition were collected and normalized and four independent experiments were combined by calculating the weighted mean and variance for each condition.",

            "text": "We first asked whether LRF was differentially expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage during the progression of demyelinating disease with spontaneous remyelination. MHV infection results in oligodendrocyte loss over 2\u20103 wpi that causes focal demyelination throughout the spinal cord followed by OP amplification by 4 wpi, which then advances to oligodendrogenesis and remyelination by 8 wpi (Redwine & Armstrong, 1998; Vana et al., 2007b). Immunohistochemistry for LRF, along with CNP to detect myelin, demonstrates the pattern of LRF expression relative to demyelination. Normal myelination is observed in PBS\u2010injected control mice (Figure 1a) with LRF expressed in the nuclei of smaller cells throughout the white matter as well as in relatively large gray matter neurons (Figure 1a). The majority of oligodendrocyte lineage cells, detected by Olig2, exhibit nuclear LRF in normal white matter (PBS controls; Figure 1a,d,g). At 4 wpi, focal demyelination is evident based on the loss of immunoreactivity for myelin proteins, MOG (data not shown), or CNP (Figure 1b), as well as by loss of Olig2 cells (Figure 1e,g). Specifically, the population of Olig2 cells that express LRF is significantly reduced (Figure 1g). LRF cells without Olig2, i.e. non\u2010oligodendrocyte lineage cells, are abundant in demyelinated lesions and co\u2010label for markers of lymphocytes, microglia, and astrocytes (Supplemental Figure S2). At 8 wpi, demyelination is no longer detected using CNP immunostaining (Figure 1c) and lesion areas are repopulated by Olig2 cells (Figure 1f,g). The total Olig2 population, with and without LRF expression, shows recovery of the oligodendrocyte lineage cells from approximately 400 cells/mm2 at 4 wpi to over 800 cells/mm2 at 8 wpi (Figure 1g).",

In non\u2010lesioned adult white matter, the majority of NG2 cells do not express LRF (see PBS controls in Figure 2a,d). The NG2 population is increased in demyelinated lesions (Figure 2b,d). The amplified NG2 population mainly does not express LRF (Figure 2d). In contrast, GSTpi labeled oligodendrocytes are significantly reduced in demyelinated lesions (Figure 2e), and comprise over a 66% reduction of GSTpi labeled cells expressing LRF in demyelinated lesions (Figure 2e,g). During remyelination, GSTpi cells recover to control levels (Figure 2e,h). However, in MHV mice at 8 wpi the population of cells that expressed Olig2 without LRF is approximately 400 cells/mm2 (Figure 1g), which is larger than the approximately 200 cells/mm2 from the combination of NG2 and GSTpi cells without LRF (Figure 2d,e). Therefore, the LRF negative population includes a stage of cells detected by Olig2 and not accounted for by NG2 or GSTpi. Overall, LRF expression corresponds strongly with mature oligodendrocytes and changes along with the oligodendrocyte population throughout the progression from demyelination to remyelination.",

A subsequent cohort of Plp/CreER\nT\n:Zbtb7a\nfl/fl mice was treated with 0.3% cuprizone (Figure S4b). The higher cuprizone dose was used to maximize demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss while maintaining continuous availability of wheels to maintain the same paradigm used for the 0.2% cuprizone cohort.

Tamoxifen was administered after week 5, and cuprizone ingestion was again used at the 0.3% dose to maximize demyelination and for tissue analysis along with the 0.3% cuprizone cohort that was tested on the wheel assay. At 6 weeks of cuprizone, mice were either perfused or given a 3\u2010week recovery period on normal chow for analysis of early remyelination. Mice examined at the end of the 6 weeks of 0.3% cuprizone showed effective demyelination (Figure 5a). During the subsequent 3\u2010week recovery period, remyelination was significantly reduced in mice administered tamoxifen (Figure 5b). While the MOG area reduction is modest, the tamoxifen area values are below the 90th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size. Using the mice from the complex wheel behavioral assessment, oligodendrogenesis and remyelination were also examined with tamoxifen administered at 6 weeks of 0.3% cuprizone, followed by 6 weeks for recovery on normal chow. Again, mice administered tamoxifen exhibited significantly less remyelination after the 6\u2010week recovery period (Figure 5c). The MOG area reduction is modest yet the tamoxifen area values are below the 95th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size calculation. In addition, the node of Ranvier organization is disrupted during cuprizone demyelination and continues to be markedly disorganized at 3 weeks after ending cuprizone (data not shown). With the progression of remyelination at 6 weeks after cuprizone, immunolabeling for Caspr and Nav1.6 shows relatively normal nodal structure in mice administered oil while examples of disrupted broader nodes continued to be found in mice administered tamoxifen (Figure 5c). Tamoxifen administration did not alter the density of oligodendrocytes at any of the time points (Figure 5d\u2010f). These results with 0.3% cuprizone show that LRF knockdown reduces the extent of remyelination but does not alter oligodendrocyte repopulation of the corpus callosum. Therefore, LRF knockdown produced a relatively modest but significant reduction in remyelination in 3 independent cohorts of mice after either 0.2% (Figure 4c) or 0.3% cuprizone (Figure 5b,c).",

Mice were administered tamoxifen at 4 weeks of cuprizone and then analyzed at the end of the 6 weeks of cuprizone demyelination (Figure 6a\u2010i). Mice administered tamoxifen had significantly lower levels of corpus callosum myelin, as estimated by MOG immunoreactivity (Figure 6a\u2010c). In mice with tamoxifen administration, the MOG area is markedly reduced (approximately 44%) and the area values are below the 97th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size. After a 3\u2010week recovery period on normal chow, myelination in mice given tamoxifen or vehicle recovered to similar levels (Figure S5). These findings indicate that LRF knockdown in NG2CreER\nT\n:Zbtb7a\nfl/fl mice impaired the early remyelination that occurs as oligodendrocytes are generated while mice are still on cuprizone at 6 weeks. LRF knockdown appeared to also reduce the density of oligodendrocytes, identified by PLP expression, but this effect was not statistically significant (Figure 6d\u2010f). The density of OP cells, detected with in situ hybridization for PDGF alpha\u2010receptor (PDGFaR), was not different in tamoxifen versus vehicle treated mice (Figure 6g\u2010i). This result is consistent with LRF expression in only a minority of OP cells so that LRF deletion should have little effect at the OP stage.",

            "text": "To gain insight as to the potential role of LRF in acting as a transcription factor relevant to remyelination, we co\u2010transfected OP cells with an LRF expression plasmid and myelin gene promoter element plasmids driving luciferase expression (Figure 7). This analysis included the promoters for MBP and CNP, which are repressed by Hes5 (Liu et al., 2006), since LRF has been associated with the notch\u2010signaling pathway (Lee et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2007). Transcriptional activity from the full length MBP promoter was highest in OP cells grown in defined medium (i.e., without mitogens), which indicates appropriate transcriptional regulation during OP differentiation (Figure 7a). LRF significantly repressed transcription from the full length MBP promoter (Figure 7a). LRF regulation of a truncated MBP promoter was then used to examine dependence on Sp1 transcription factor binding sites. LRF can interact with Sp1 promoter elements and Sp1 phosphorylation initiates upregulation of MBP (Choi et al., 2008; Guo, Eviatar\u2010Ribak, & Miskimins, 2010). In conditions that promoted differentiation, LRF repression of the truncated MBP required an intact Sp1 site (Figure 7b,c). The second myelin\u2010specific gene, CNP, is expressed from an early stage in the oligodendrocyte lineage (Zhang et al., 2009); accordingly, the CNP promoter response was expressed similarly with and without mitogens present. CNP transcription was strongly repressed by LRF in both growth conditions (Figure 7d). Finally, analysis was extended to the promoter for FASN, which encodes fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of the fatty acid palmitate that is essential for lipids in cell membranes and myelin (Smith, Witkowski, & Joshi 2003). In contrast to MBP and CNP, FASN promoter activity was not reduced by the presence of LRF in defined medium, which promoted differentiation (Figure 7e). However, LRF significantly increased FASN promoter activity in mitogenic conditions that maintained OP cells in an immature, proliferative stage (Figure 7e). These myelin gene promoter assays indicate that LRF has the potential to regulate myelin gene transcription in a context dependent manner.",

In cultures of OP cells in the presence of mitogens, LRF enhanced Hes1 transcription (Figure 8a). Co\u2010transfection with Notch1IC increases notch tone and inhibits OP differentiation (Zhou et al., 2007). In the presence of Notch1IC, LRF enhanced transcription from the Hes1 promoter, but only in the presence of mitogens (Figure 8b). LRF repressed Hes5 transcription in OP cells cultured with mitogens (Figure 8c). In the presence of Notch1IC, LRF significantly repressed Hes5 transcriptional activity both in defined medium and in the presence of mitogens (Figure 8d). Therefore, LRF specifically represses Hes5 transcription in OP cells across growth conditions (Figure 8c,d). The potential for LRF and notch pathway interactions to play a role during remyelination is indicated by Notch1 and Jagged1 upregulation in cuprizone lesions along with LRF co\u2010localization in cells expressing Hes5 (Supplemental Figure S6). This time point of 5 weeks of cuprizone ingestion corresponds well with the 4\u20106 week cuprizone period of LRF knockdown that reduced MOG in NG2CreER\nT\n:Zbtb7a\nfl/fl mice (Figure 6a).",

Within the promoter elements tested, those that showed repression contain one or more potential LRF consensus sites in the proximal promoter region. However, LRF binding of DNA appears flexible and may involve a single site or two half sites with variable orientation and separation (Lee et al., 2013; Pessler & Hernandez, 2003).

The epigenetic landscape of myelin\u2010specific promoters may be particularly important for LRF binding or the effect of LRF molecular interactions, such as recruitment of HDACs (Liu et al., 2004), which must occur at the appropriate time and site. Our experiments of LRF expression from transfection in OP cells may provide insights from the context\u2010dependent effect elicited by the testing in two growth conditions (Figure 7). Growth in defined medium initiates OP differentiation and increased transcription from the full length MBP promoter (Figure 7). Similar studies have shown that protein kinase C phosphorylates Sp1 to increase MBP transcription in differentiated oligodendrocytes, but not in proliferating OP cells (Guo et al., 2010). LRF may repress MBP transcription in differentiating oligodendrocytes through interaction with phosphorylated Sp1 binding, which is abolished by mutation of the Sp1 site (Figure 7a\u2010c). This effect is similar to that seen on the Rb tumor suppressor gene in cancer cells, where LRF can repress transcription through interaction with Sp1 and recruitment of histone deacetylase (Jeon et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Sp1 may also be involved in LRF regulation of FASN in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. LRF interacts with SREBP\u20101 at Sp1 sites to synergistically activate FASN transcription in multiple cell lines (Choi et al., 2008). FASN is a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis that is essential for phospholipids in myelin and cell membranes (Smith et al., 2003). In OP cells, SREBPs are important regulators of oligodendrocyte maturation and FASN levels (Monnerie et al., 2017). A high demand for lipids is associated with membrane biogenesis for cell division and for formation of myelin. The short term culture conditions used for promoter analysis during OP differentiation were not sufficient to test the role of LRF on FASN transcription during myelin sheath elaboration. In the presence of mitogens that stimulate OP proliferation, LRF co\u2010transfection resulted in transcriptional activation of the FASN promoter (Figure 7e). A positive effect of LRF on FASN levels in conditions of high membrane biogenesis would be consistent with continued expression of LRF in mature oligodendrocytes (Figure 2). This role for LRF would also be consistent with the reduced remyelination after LRF knockdown (Figures 4, 5, 6).",

MBP and CNP have been shown to be repressed by Hes5 (Liu et al., 2006). Therefore, LRF overexpression could be expected to release or de\u2010repress MBP and CNP from Hes5 repression. Importantly, in vitro LRF co\u2010transfection reduced MBP and CNP promoter activity (Figure 7), which is not consistent with our in vivo results of reduced myelin levels with LRF knockdown during remyelination (Figures 4, 5, 6). A potential explanation for this in vitro result is that LRF is overexpressed after transfection of the LRF plasmid. A further explanation may be that transfection at the OP cell stage is ectopic since LRF is not expressed in the majority OP cells in vivo. Furthermore, the binding sites of transfected MBP and CNP promoter constructs may not undergo the epigenetic modifications in myelin genes that occur with lineage progression. This artificial approach thus reveals a potent LRF repression of these myelin gene promoters, especially CNP, early in the lineage that must undergo as yet unknown modifications to prevent this potent repression of myelin genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Since high levels of membrane biogenesis are required for both cell proliferation and myelin formation, FASN may not be as restricted to such cell stage specific promoter modifications. Along these lines, we note that the adult brain and spinal cord exhibits strong LRF expression in neurons, which also have a high level of membrane biogenesis to maintain extensive processes and continuously synthesize vesicles for axonal transport.",

After viral clearance mediated through a Th1 immune response, demyelinated areas undergo effective spontaneous remyelination (Jordan et al., 1989; Parra et al., 1999). MHV lesions have increased expression of diverse cytokines and mitogens, including PDGF and FGF2 mitogens (Messersmith et al., 2000; Redwine & Armstrong, 1998).

Cuprizone ingestion results in high OP proliferation after 4\u20105 weeks and is followed by initial oligodendrocyte repopulation of lesions within 6 weeks (Armstrong et al., 2006; Armstrong et al., 2002). Cuprizone demyelinated lesions include several factors examined in our in vitro promoter assays. Namely, cuprizone lesions exhibit upregulation of the mitogens PDGF and FGF2 (Armstrong et al., 2006; Armstrong et al., 2002; Vana, Lucchinetti, Le, & Armstrong, 2007a). Notch1 is also upregulated in proliferating OP cells and Jagged1 is present in lesion areas (Figure S6). Furthermore, Hes5 is present in OP cells and HDAC1 binding to the Hes5 promoter is increased during cuprizone demyelination, followed by normalization early in remyelination (Shen et al., 2008). Hes5 inhibits OP differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in the context of both developmental myelination and remyelination (Kondo & Raff, 2000; Liu et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008; Wang et al., 1998). Hes5 may also be a downstream partner that intersects with fibroblast growth factor signaling, which inhibits OP differentiation in demyelinated lesions (Zhou & Armstrong, 2007).",

Confirming appropriate conditional expression from the Plp/CreERT line, this LRF reduction is restricted to the oligodendrocyte lineage since cells that are not labeled for Olig2 do not show reduced LRF (D). Among cells expressing Olig2, those double labeled for LRF are significantly reduced in mice administered tamoxifen (E). Mice administered oil have few Olig2 cells that are not labeled with LRF (F). The total population of Olig2 cells is unchanged by tamoxifen administration and reduction of LRF expression (G). Scale bar = 250 um. Student t\u2010test using n = 4 mice in each condition.",

In mice administered oil, the remyelination is equivalent to myelination in age\u2010matched Plp/CreERT:Zbtb7a\nfl/fl mice that were not fed cuprizone (no cup; C).

Demyelination of the corpus callosum was induced in Plp/CreERT:Zbtb7a\nfl/fl mice by feeding 0.3% cuprizone for 6 weeks. A higher dose of cuprizone was used to maximize demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss while allowing continuous access to either the training or complex wheel configuration. Mice were administered tamoxifen (Tam), or vehicle (Oil) after week 5 of cuprizone feeding and then perfused at the end of week 6 on cuprizone (no recovery; A, D) or after a 3 week period on a normal chow diet to allow for spontaneous remyelination (3 wks recovery; B, E). The mice analyzed for the 6 week recovery time point (6 wks recovery; C, F) are from the wheel assessments shown in Figure S3 and so were given tamoxifen at the end of the 6 week period of cuprizone demyelination. Quantification of MOG immunoreactivity was used to estimate the myelinated area of the corpus callosum (A\u2010C). In mice administered tamoxifen to knockdown LRF, the extent of remyelination is significantly reduced at both the 3 and 6 week time points of the recovery period (3 weeks, p < 0.0364, Cohen's d effect size = 1.35, n = 6 oil, n = 7 tamoxifen; 6 weeks, p < 0.0296, Cohen's d effect size = 1.67, n = 5 oil, n = 5 tamoxifen).

Transcription from the full\u2010length promoter for myelin basic protein (1323MBP) is significantly higher in defined medium (**p = 0.0017), indicating appropriate upregulation as expected during OP differentiation in vitro (A). Co\u2010transfection with the Tom\u2010LRF plasmid significantly represses transcription from 1323MBP in defined medium (****p < 0.0001; A).
