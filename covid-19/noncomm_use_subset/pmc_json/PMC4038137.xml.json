However, it is important to recognize that multiplex RT-PCR may have different analytic sensitivities for the different viruses, which can affect the diagnostic yield. In addition, viral load may vary for specific viral infections with RSV viral load typically low in the upper airways of adults [5, 17, 18]. Another factor that may explain the variability of virus detection rates in the literature is the clinical definition used to trigger swab collection and further laboratory testing. There is currently no universally accepted definition of all ILI or moderate-to-severe ILI, in particular in the elderly population where the clinical presentation may be atypical. We attempted to define moderate-to-severe ILI using objective and subjective criteria, which we felt were relevant to respiratory illnesses rather than minor colds. Fever occurs less commonly in the elderly; our definition of ILI, which did not require the presence of fever, is an important difference from other studies using ILI definitions to evaluate noninfluenza viruses. The inclusion of fever as an obligatory part of the ILI case definition would have excluded around 30%\u201360% of cases, depending on virus type. The majority of subjects with moderate-to-severe ILI were identified by an ISS >2. Although every attempt was made to capture all cases, proportionally more swabs (up to 44%) were missed from episodes with pneumonia and hospitalization. This may mean that subjects presenting with an ILI that resulted in pneumonia deteriorated so rapidly that no swab could be collected in time. Thus, our data may have missed part of the most severe spectrum of disease (no deaths occurred in the test cohort). Of note, as per protocol, swabs were only to be taken if an ILI occurred. A subject presenting with pneumonia without a preceding ILI as per the protocol definition, would have had no swab taken.",

We were not able to distinguish simple viral infection from combined viral and bacterial infections.
