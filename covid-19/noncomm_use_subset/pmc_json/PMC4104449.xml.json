We impose the strict criterion that the network is regarded to have been fully reconstructed if and only if both success rates reach 100%. The sparsity of links makes it necessary to define SREL and SRNC separately. As the reconstruction method is implemented for each node in the network, we define SREL and SRNC on the basis of each individual node and the two success rates for the entire network are the respective averaged values over all nodes. We also consider the issue of trade-off in terms of the true positive rate (for correctly inferred links) and the false positive rate (for incorrectly inferred links).",

For small values of , for example, , the values of elements associated with links and that associated with null connections (actual zeros in the adjacency matrix) overlap, leading to ambiguities in the identification of links. In contrast, for larger values of , for example, , an apparent gap emerges between the two groups of element values, enabling us to correctly identify all links by simply setting a cut-off within the gap (see Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note 4 for a method to set the cut-off). The success rates (SREL and SRNC) as a function of  for SIS and CP on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are shown in Fig. 2b,c, where we observe nearly perfect reconstruction of links insofar as  exceeds a relatively small value\u2014an advantage of compressed sensing. The exact reconstruction is robust in the sense that a wide range of  values can yield nearly 100% success rates.

Figure 3a,b show the success rate as a function of the relative length nt of time series for SIS and CP dynamics on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, where nt is the total length of time series from the beginning of the spreading process divided by the network size N. The results demonstrate that even for very small values of nt, most links can already be identified, as reflected by the high values of the success rate shown. Figure 3c,d show the minimum length  required to achieve at least 95% success rate for different network sizes. For both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks,  decreases considerably as N is increased. This seemingly counterintuitive result is due to the fact that different base strings can share strings at different times to enable reconstruction. In general, as N is increased,  will increase accordingly. However, a particular string can belong to different base strings with respect to the threshold \u0394, accounting for the slight increase in the absolute length of the time series (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 5) and the reduction in  (see Supplementary Note 3 on the method to choose base and subordinate strings). The dependence of the success rate on the average node degree \u2039k\u203a for SIS and CP on different networks has been investigated as well (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 5).

Figure 4a,b show the dependence of the success rate on the fraction nf of states in the time series that flip due to noise for SIS and CP dynamics on two types of networks. We observe that the success rates are hardly affected, providing strong evidence for the applicability of our reconstruction method. For example, even when 25% of the nodal states flip, we can still achieve about 80% success rates for both dynamical processes and different network topologies. Figure 4c,d present the success rate versus the fraction nm of unobservable nodes, the states of which are externally inaccessible. We find that the high success rate remains mostly unchanged as nm is increased from 0 to 25%, a somewhat counterintuitive but striking result. The high degree of robustness against the limit to accessing nodal states is elaborated further in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 5. We find that, in general, missing information can affect the reconstruction of the neighbouring vector, as reflected by the reduction of the gap between the reconstructed values associated with actual links and null connections. However, even for high values of nm, for example, nm=0.3, there is still a clear gap, indicating that a full recovery of all links is achievable. We have also found that our method is robust against inaccurately specified diffusion processes with fluctuation in infection rates (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 5). Taken together, the high accuracy, efficiency and robustness against noise, missing information and inaccurately modelling of real dynamical processes provide strong credence for the validity and power of our framework for binary time-series-based network reconstruction.",

This is an essential step to implement target vaccination strategy in a population or on a computer network to effectively suppress/prevent the spreading of virus at low cost, as a large body of literature indicates that knowledge about the network structure and individual characteristics is sufficient for controlling the spreading dynamics47484950. Here we offer an effective method to infer the individuals\u2019 infection rates \u03bbi based solely on the binary time series of the nodal states after an outbreak of contamination. (To our knowledge, there was no prior work addressing this critical issue.) In particular, after all links have been successfully predicted, \u03bbi can be deduced from the infection probabilities that can be approximated by the corresponding infection frequencies (see Methods). These probabilities depend on both \u03bbi and the number of infected neighbours. The reproduced infection rates \u03bbi of individuals for both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks are in quite good agreement with the true values with small prediction errors (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Note 6). Results from a comprehensive error analysis are listed in Table 1, where the uniformly high accuracy validates our method. The inhomogeneous recovery rates \u03b4i of nodes can be predicted from the binary time series in a more straightforward way, because \u03b4i do not depend on the nodal connections (see Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Note 6). Thus, our framework is capable of predicting characteristics of nodal diversity in terms of degrees, and infection and recovery rates based solely on binary time series of nodal states.",

Starting from the neighbourhood of the source, the infection originates from the source and spreads all over the network. We collect a set of time series of the nodal states, except the hidden source (see Methods). The basic idea of ascertaining and locating the hidden source is based on missing information from the hidden source when attempting to reconstruct the network. In particular, to reconstruct the connections belonging to the immediate neighbourhood of the source accurately, time series from the source are needed to generate the matrix \u03a6 and the vector Y. However, as the source is hidden, no time series from it are available, leading to reconstruction inaccuracy and, consequently, anomalies in the predicted link patterns of the neighbouring nodes. It is then possible to detect the neighbourhood of the hidden source by identifying any abnormal connection patterns51, which can be accomplished by using different data segments. If the inferred links of a node are stable with respect to different data segments, the node can be deemed to have no connection with the hidden source; otherwise, if the result of inferring a node\u2019s links varies significantly with respect to different data segments, the node is likely to be connected to the hidden source. The s.d. of the predicted results with respect to different data segments can be used as a quantitative criterion for the anomaly.

Both theoretically and practically, our framework can be used to address the extremely challenging problem of reconstructing the intrinsic interacting patterns of complex stochastic systems based on small amounts of polarized time series. The key to success of our method lies in our development of a novel class of transformation, allowing the network inference problem to be converted to the problem of sparse signal reconstruction, which can then be solved by the standard compressed-sensing algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of our framework in uncovering the network structure, the natural diversity in the nodal characteristics, and any hidden source are guaranteed by the CST with rigorous proof for low-data requirement and convergence to optimal solution. The feasibility of our framework has been demonstrated using a large number of combinations of epidemic processes and network structures, where in all cases highly accurate reconstruction is achieved. Our approach opens up a new avenue towards fully addressing the inverse problem in complex stochastic systems in a highly efficient manner, a fundamental stepping stone towards understanding and controlling complex dynamical systems in general.",

Although for any spreading dynamics, the most effective way to prevent a large-scale outbreak is to implement control during the early stage, this may be impractical in many situations. If we miss the early stage, which is possible especially in complex networks where the epidemic threshold can be near zero, to be able to reconstruct the spreading network is of tremendous value.

The idea roots in the fact that the infection probability of a node approximated by the frequency of being infected calculated from time series is determined both by its infection rate and by the number of infected nodes in its neighbourhood. To provide an intuitive picture, we consider the following simple scenario in which the number of infected neighbours of node i does not change with time. In this case, the probability of i being infected at each time step is fixed. We can thus count the frequency of the 01 and 00 pairs embedded in the time series of i. The ratio of the number of 01 pairs over the total number of 01 and 00 pairs gives approximately the infection probability. The infection rate can then be calculated by using equations (4) and (7) for the SIS and CP dynamics, respectively. In a real-world situation, however, the number of infected neighbours varies with time. The time-varying factor can be taken into account by sorting out the time instants corresponding to different numbers of the infected neighbours, and the infection probability can be obtained at the corresponding time instants, leading to a set of values for the infection rate whose average represents an accurate estimate of the true infection rate for each node.",
