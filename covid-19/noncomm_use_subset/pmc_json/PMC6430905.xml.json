Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F5, rota\u2010 and coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) are the 4 most important enteropathogens associated with NCD. In field conditions, the majority of diarrheic calves are concurrently infected with >1 pathogen. These enteropathogens primarily induce damage to the intestinal mucosa, involving villous atrophy and enterocyte mass reduction. The clinical consequences of inflammation and loss of mucosal integrity primarily in the small bowel include diarrhea, dehydration, malnutrition, potentially systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, and even death.1, 4, 5\n",

NO is known to have various physiological functions, including neurotransmission, immune defense, and organ perfusion and play a key role in various pathological processes. ARG is the only substrate for synthesis of NO.19 Approximately 80% of CIT is converted to ARG in the kidneys and plays an important role in providing an ARG/NO balance through different mechanisms.7, 16 Ammonia is a toxic compound and excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death.20, 21 CIT and ARG play a key role in detoxifying ammonia in the urea cycle.21 Deficiencies of CIT and ARG might underlie the negative consequences of inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis and endotoxemia.13, 16, 17\n",

The respective distributions of all numerical data within each study group were checked for normality by the Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov or Shapiro\u2010Wilk tests. Nonnormally distributed variables were log transformed for analysis or analyzed by nonparametric methods. The measurements were analyzed in total and separately by group with the groups formed by diarrhea etiology, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and SIRS status. Diarrheic subgroups classified by the above mentioned criteria compared with age\u2010matched healthy controls. For normally distributed data with or without transformation, Student's t test was used for comparisons between 2 groups (healthy controls vs all diarrheic calves), and 1\u2010way anova followed by Tukey's test was performed for comparisons among 3 or more groups (healthy controls and diarrheic subgroups). For data not normally distributed even after transformation, comparisons among groups were made by nonparametric tests (2 groups: Mann\u2010Whitney U\u2010test; 3 or more groups: Kruskal\u2010Wallis test). Friedman's test was used to determine for changes in plasma CIT, ARG, NO, and blood ammonia concentrations over time in the healthy control group. Regression analysis was performed to assess the associations among plasma CIT, ARG, and NO, and blood ammonia concentrations and potential explanatory variables, namely age of calf (day), the presence of SIRS (no = 0; yes = 1) and etiology of diarrhea (noninfectious = 0; infectious = 1) in the diarrheic calves. Initially, simple linear regression was performed. A multiple linear regression by backward method was then constructed, which initially included any variables identified as P value <.2 on univariable analysis.

In the present study, 21 (41%) neonatal calves with infectious diarrhea had a single infection of C. parvum, and 11 (22%) had concurrent infection of C. parvum with rotavirus (Table 1). In concurrently infected calves, clinical signs related to diarrhea were more severe. Rotavirus, coronavirus, and C. parvum primarily cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, involving villous atrophy and enterocyte mass reduction. Furthermore, heat\u2010stable toxin production induced by ETEC leads to the upregulation of chloride secretion into the gut.1 The clinical consequences of inflammation and loss of mucosal integrity in the bowel of the neonatal calf include maldigestion/malabsorption, secretory diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, potentially SIRS or sepsis, and even death.1, 2, 3, 4 In the present study, clinical signs and hematobiochemical results related to dehydration and acid\u2010base imbalance of the diarrheic calves (Table 2) were in agreement with those of other studies2, 5, 23, 24, 25, 27 and are not discussed further.",

In contrast to pigs, no previous studies in neonatal calves have reported lower postnatal concentrations of plasma CIT and ARG nor rates of intestinal CIT and ARG synthesis from glutamine.32, 33 Therefore, these factors influencing plasma CIT and ARG levels can be excluded. Another reason for this discordance could be primarily related to different measurement methods. Differences in sample handling and storage procedures might account for differences between NO levels of healthy calves in this study and those reported in the literature.39 The blood ammonia concentration with a median of 28.7 \u03bcmol/L in healthy control calves (Table 2) was in agreement with the values <90 \u03bcmol/L reported previously by other investigators.40\n",

However, our plasma CIT result is in agreement with the findings of several previous reports in humans with enteropathies10, 11, 12, 15 and sepsis,13, 16, 17 as well as in dogs.22, 42 As previously reported in humans, decreased plasma CIT and ARG in diarrheic calves could be because of impaired intestinal production, different metabolic processes altered in inflammatory conditions, or a combination of both.9, 11, 13, 33, 42 Infectious diarrhea in neonatal calves results in a low to strong inflammatory response.1, 4, 43 Approximately 80% of CIT is converted to the amino acid, ARG, in the body to support ARG and NO levels.6, 8, 9, 44 Conversion of CIT to ARG and converting/recycling ARG to CIT and NO appear to be dependent on the severity of inflammation.6, 7, 14 Therefore, the decreases in plasma CIT and ARG levels can especially be based on intestinal damage, dysfunction, or both mechanisms, leading to the impaired production of these amino acids. Although small bowel enteroscopy or histopathological examination was not performed in this study, certain enteropathogens, particularly C. parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus are associated with mucosal injury in calves.1, 4 Considering all of these factors, low plasma CIT and ARG concentrations in neonatal calves with diarrhea (Table 2) could primarily be caused by decreased substrate (glutamine, glutamate) availability in the bowel and impaired gut function because of damage. Because infectious diarrhea might lead more intestinal damage or intestinal dysfunction, we expected plasma CIT levels to be lower in calves with infectious diarrhea than in calves with noninfectious diarrhea. However, differences in CIT and ARG levels between calves with infectious diarrhea and calves with noninfectious diarrhea did not reach statistical significance (27.6 [13.2\u201054.7] vs 41.5 [28.2\u201068.5] \u03bcmol/L; P = .49) and (101.6 [52.9\u2010169.8] vs 177.5 [104.8\u2010260.5] \u03bcmol/L; P = .49), respectively (Figure 1A,B). We cannot explain the exact reasons for these results. Perhaps this result stems from the low number of calves with noninfectious diarrhea enrolled in the study. Another factor affecting plasma CIT concentration might be renal impairment.6 However, CIT is metabolized into ARG in the intestine instead of the kidney in newborn calves, therefore renal failure might have only a very limited effect on plasma CIT concentration in our study.33\n",

These results could be explained by intestinal damage and increasing mucosal permeability with more severe inflammation in SIRS and diarrhea\u2010induced dehydration by causative agents. Small bowel damage might be central in the development of SIRS and sepsis, thus low levels of CIT and ARG have been reported in adults and children with sepsis and other critical illness13, 19, 45, 46 as well as in dogs.22, 42 Because SIRS can affect gut function and integrity, alterations in glutamine metabolism might exist and lead to decreased CIT production. Significantly lower plasma CIT concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS than that in diarrheic calves without SIRS might be in part a result of a defect in the metabolic conversion of glutamine to CIT and decreased uptake of glutamine by the enterocyte.6 In addition, CIT production is severely reduced during SIRS and sepsis, resulting in diminished ARG de novo production and NO availability.7, 9\n",

Similar to previous studies in humans50 and calves38 with acute diarrhea, higher plasma NO concentration in diarrheic calves (Table 2) can be related with an increased local NO production in the intestine49 or by enteropathogens such as rotavirus, Cryptosporidium and Giardia.50, 51, 52 Additionally, because diarrheic calves had decreased renal perfusion related to hypovolemia as estimated by serum creatinine, decreased urinary excretion of nitrate might have contributed to increased plasma NO concentration of the diarrheic calves in the present study (Table 2). In agreement with the results of previous studies in humans with acute infectious gastroenteritis,53 plasma NO concentrations were significantly higher in calves with acute infectious diarrhea than in calves with noninfectious diarrhea and healthy calves (Figure 1C). The increases in plasma NO concentrations were greater in severe diarrhea (FS 3), severe dehydrated and SIRS positive subgroups, indicating also that severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and SIRS status influence the blood levels of NO (Figures 2C and 4C). Besides intestinal damage because of enteropathogens, dehydration might play a role in the acute phase response, thus increasing the induction of iNOS.47 Therefore, significantly higher plasma NO concentration might be possible in severely dehydrated diarrheic calves than those in mildly or moderately dehydrated calves, as well as healthy calves. In addition, increased plasma NO concentration is related to SIRS positivity. Increased nitrate levels in serum or plasma, indicating NO formation, are well documented in patients with SIRS or sepsis, and this alteration contributes to intestinal damage and its consequences.9 In the present study, significantly higher plasma NO concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS can also be explained by a similar process (Figure 4C).",

            "text": "Ammonia is a toxic compound to many organ systems, especially the brain. Excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, mental disorders, seizures, coma, and death. Increases in blood ammonia concentration are generally considered to only be a result of liver\u2010related disorders, but other underlying causes should be assessed as well.20 High blood ammonia levels can develop from several different mechanisms, including (1) hepatic insufficiency, (2) reduced activity of urea cycle enzymes, (3) metabolic disorders of organic acids, and (4) portosystemic shunt.20 In the present study, blood ammonia concentration with a median of 59.8 \u03bcmol/L in diarrheic calves was significantly higher than that in healthy calves (Table 2). Although these median levels remained within the reference range (<90 \u03bcmol/L) reported for cattle,40 median blood ammonia levels in the severe diarrhea (105.7 \u03bcmol/L), severe dehydration (113.9 \u03bcmol/L), and SIRS positive (105.7 \u03bcmol/L) subgroups were above the reference limits (Figures 2D, 3D, and 4D). This increase in these subgroups can be considered to be hyperammonemia and might be related to the loss of liver or kidney function because of circulatory failure in the result of diarrhea, as well as the decrease of plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations which decreases the efficiency of the urea cycle. In this content, hyperammonemia has also been reported in a human case of short bowel syndrome along with decreased concentrations of arginine and citrulline54 and in systemic infections with bacteria or virus.55 The moderate and positive relationship of blood ammonia with SIRS status (Table 3) and the effects of severity of diarrhea and degree of dehydration) might be based on the factors affecting urea cycle and ammonia metabolism.20\n",

This study included a variety of mono or combined causative agents (Table 1) in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea of various degree and duration. First, because we did not perform an endoscopy, histopathological examination, or both modalities, it was not possible to determine the localization and extension of the inflammatory process in the intestine of diarrheic calves. Therefore, it is difficult to directly explain significant decreases in plasma CIT and ARG and increases in plasma NO and blood ammonia concentrations in neonatal calves. Second, measurements of plasma CIT, ARG, NO, and blood ammonia levels were only performed at 1 point in time. Serial measurements of these variables during the diarrhea course would provide additional important information. Third, the absence of all enteropathogens associated with NCD in calves with noninfectious diarrhea cannot be determined because only the antigens of the most common enteropathogens in feces were evaluated. Additionally, the duration of disease is a confounding factor which could cause difficulty in diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea. Lastly, the sample size of this study was small, especially in neonatal calves with noninfectious diarrhea.",
