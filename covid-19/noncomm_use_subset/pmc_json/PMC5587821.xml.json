Nucleic acid amplification assays are the method most widely used to provide laboratory confirmation of MERS [1]. MERS cases are routinely confirmed based on the detection of unique MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA sequences by real-time reverse-transcription (rRT)-PCR, with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary [2]. The WHO recently published updated interim recommendations for MERS-CoV laboratory testing and recommends an rRT-PCR assay targeting the envelope (upE) gene for screening, followed by confirmation with an assay for the regions encoding either the open reading frame (ORF)1a, ORF1b, or the nucleocapsid protein (N). For sequencing, two target sites on the MERS-CoV genome, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes, are suggested [234].",

Serial dilutions were analyzed, with 20 replicates per dilution. Probit analysis was used to determine the 95% LOD. Reproducibility, repeatability, and lot-to-lot precision were determined by using three concentrations (50, 150, and 300 copies/\u00b5L). Reproducibility was calculated by testing duplicates of each concentration in a single run for five days at two different test sites. Repeatability was calculated by testing duplicates of each concentration in a single run for 20 days. Lot-to-lot precision was accessed by testing duplicates of each concentration in a single run for five days using three different lots.

Monitoring specimen quality is important because assay performance for detection of MERS-CoV is dependent on specimen quality [14].",

Furthermore, the 50 clinical specimens from MERS-confirmed patients were all sputum specimens. Although lower respiratory specimens are the preferred specimen type for initial MERS diagnosis because of their higher MERS-CoV load, rRT-PCR testing using other specimen types, including serum, urine, and stool specimens, is required in MERS-confirmed cases [21617]. Thus, further study to evaluate performance using other specimen types is needed. Second, we did not compare assay performance across different real-time PCR platforms. The PowerChek MERS assay was developed to allow flexibility in the choice of real-time PCR platforms, and can be used with the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), LightCycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), Rotor-gene Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or Mx3005P thermocycler (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA); however, we evaluated the performance using only the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system.",
