The former, one of the most common infectious diseases, was referred to acute inflammation from nasal cavity to the throat, and the latter, also a commonly seen infectious disease, could be cured only in the condition that an effective antibiotic is selected based on the identification of the pathogen that has caused the infection. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) continue to be an important cause of acute illnesses and mortality worldwide (especially in elderly people).1,2 The main reasons that cause acute lower respiratory tract infection in the elderly include3: 1) decreased immunity due to aging of the body, 2) weakened natural ventilation function and airway scavenging ability due to lower central cough reflex, 3) aspiration pneumonia, 4) mental factors, 5) changes in the climatic environment, and 6) bacterial infections.",

The therapeutic and economic value of antibacterial drugs in ST was gaining more attention.",

It has the doubled antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, less adverse reaction, and better pharmacokinetic characteristics, gradually replacing ofloxacin. It has shown clinical efficacy in ALRI similar to that of gatifloxacin and is at least as efficacious as the third-generation cephalosporins.23,24 Extensive clinical data have confirmed good tolerability of levofloxacin without the phototoxicity or hepatic and cardiac AEs found with some other newer fluoroquinolone drugs. Therefore, levofloxacin offers a combination of documented efficacy and tolerability and has an established place in the routine treatment of bacterial infections, including ALRI.25,26",

However, the pharmacoeconomic cost\u2013benefit analysis showed that the total cost and antimicrobial costs of the ST group were significantly lower than that of the continuous intravenous infusion group. It was also the case with the sensitivity analysis. Patients treated with ST could go home and continue the oral treatment if his/her condition was stable after the change of administration method (oral capsules). This could not only reduce the treatment cost but also lower the probability of complications developed in hospitals. The purpose of ST was to minimize the utilization of resources with the same treatment effect and reduce adverse reactions of the medicine and intravenous medication. Levofloxacin was easy to be absorbed orally with wide distribution in vivo and bioavailability >90%.27,28 Results of this research demonstrated that levofloxacin ST could be applied as an effective method for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection in the elderly. This treatment method is particularly valuable in countries like China, which has a huge population and insufficient medical resources.",
