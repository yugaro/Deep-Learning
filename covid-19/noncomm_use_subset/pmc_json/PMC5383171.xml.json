            "text": "A total of 16 primer-probe sets were used to detect pathogens that certainly or possibly cause BRDC. Each primer-probe set was designed to detect a single\ntarget pathogen. As shown in Table 1, seven primer-probe sets were adopted from a previously reported real-time PCR assay [2, 18, 20, 21, 26, 32, 33]. The remaining nine primer-probe sets were newly designed in\nthis study. To design these primers and probes, nucleotide sequences obtained from GenBank of a target pathogen were aligned, and then, primers and probes were\nselected using PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, U.S.A.). Accession numbers of sequences used for primer-probe design are\nlisted in Supplemental Table 1. The specificities of primers and probes were checked by BLAST\nsearch. In addition, as described in a previous report, a primer-probe set for bovine \u03b2-actin was as an internal control of RNA/DNA extraction and PCR reaction\n[31, 32]. TaqMan probes had 6-FAM (6-carboxy-fluorescein) fluorescent reporter\nmolecules at the 5\u2032 ends and TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetra-methyl-rhodamine) quencher molecules at the 3\u2032 ends. TaqMan probes targeting BPIV-3 and U.\ndiversum contained 6-FAM at the 5\u2032 ends and MGB (minor groove binder) and NFQ (non fluorescent quencher) at the 3\u2032 ends. Primers and probes were\ncustom-synthesized at Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and MGB probes at Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).\nThe information on primers and probes is outlined in Table 1.",

To\nevaluate PCR inhibition by nasal swab components, a positive control nucleic acid was added to negative samples after nucleic acids extraction as previously\ndescribed [3, 24]. Nasal swabs collected from clinically healthy cattle that were\nconfirmed to be negative by Dembo respiratory-PCR for all target pathogens were tested. These swabs were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (\u2212) to make 10%\nemulsion. Isolated strains of BPIV-3 strain BN-1 (AB770484), BRSV strain NMK-7, BRAV strain H-1 (JN936206), M. haemolytica strain N791\n(bovine/Japan/1979), P. multocida strain TS-8, H. somni strain 23N2359, T. pyogenes strain 42 and M.\nbovis strain Donetta were obtained from the National Veterinary Assay Laboratory in Japan. The BVDV strain Nose (bovine /Japan/1974) and BHV-1 strain\nIshikawa (bovine /Japan/1988) used in this study were isolated from field samples. To evaluate the primer-probe sets targeting BCoV, IDV, BRBV, BAdV 3 and\nU. diversum, synthesized DNA (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) was used instead of nucleic acids extracted from infectious pathogens,\nbecause these pathogens were unavailable. Nucleic acids from the 10% swab emulsion and pathogens (1.0 \u00d7 105 TCID50/ml or\nCFU/ml) were extracted as described above. Then, 10-fold serial dilutions of the extracted nucleic acids or synthesized DNA were spiked into\nthe eluates of negative nasal swabs. The final concentrations were adjusted to the following: pathogen DNA or RNA, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 to 1.0 \u00d7 102\nTCID50/reaction or CFU/reaction; and synthesized DNA, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u00b0 to 103 copies/reaction.

Since all primer-probe sets were optimized in the same temperature conditions, Dembo respiratory-PCR can detect a total of 16 pathogens,\nincluding 10 viruses and six bacteria, in a single run of TaqMan real-time PCR. Notably, we designed primers for IDV, BRAV and BRBV, which are not traditionally\ntested in Japan as etiologic agents of BRDC. IDV was first found in pigs and then from cattle, showing a significant association with BRDC [14, 23]. An assay to detect IDV by TaqMan real-time PCR has already been reported [15]. However, new IDV strains were recently identified [4,5,6, 19], and the nucleic acid sequences of some strains have mismatches to the reported\nprimer-probe set. To address this issue, a new primer-probe set was designed in this study. Nevertheless, forward primer has a few mismatches to the sequence of\nD/bovine/Ibaraki/7768/2016, which was identified very recently, and the primer is needed for further improvement. BRAV and BRBV have been commonly found in cattle\nwith BRDC in the United States [13]. BRBV was detected from BRDC cattle also in this study, but a previous study suggested\nthat BRBV was not significantly associated with BRDC [23]. The importance of BRBV in BRDC remains uncertain. IDV and BRAV\nwere undetected in the clinical samples in this study. In sensitivity test, all assays showed low LOD (\u2264100 CFU, TCID50 or copies/reaction). The LOD of\nBPIV-3 was higher than other virus (100 TCID50/reaction), but a previous study showed a similar level of sensitivity [18]. Dembo respiratory-PCR can be performed to detect pathogens that are currently considered to be associated with BRDC.",

The Dembo respiratory-PCR can quickly\nelucidate combinations of pathogen in a sample. Notably, in one BVDV-positive sample, BCoV, BRSV and bacterial pathogens were also detected. A previous study\nindicated that BRSV infection diminished the host\u2019s clearance ability in the upper respiratory tract or altered the immune response [9, 10], possibly facilitating bacterial opportunistic infections, whereas an experimental study showed\nthat infection with BRSV infection alone resulted in clinical signs and lesions in lung tissue [10]. As well as BRSV, BCoV\ngenerally impairs mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract [27]. In this way, the Dembo respiratory-PCR helps\nrevealing the infection of multiple pathogens at once. For the same purpose, multiplex PCRs that can detect utmost three pathogens were developed in the previous\nstudies [18, 30]. However, multiplex PCR has the restriction on target number and\nthe risk that primer-probe sets interfere in each other.",
