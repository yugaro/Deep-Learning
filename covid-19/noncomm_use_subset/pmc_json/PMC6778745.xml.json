Respiratory viral infection is not uncommon in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure2. Some studies have reported that the frequency of respiratory viral infection ranged from 13.4% to 49%345. Availability of multiplex reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has facilitated the identification of respiratory viral infection6. Among the diverse risk factors for ARDS, respiratory viral infection has been shown to contribute to development and progression of pulmonary ARDS78. Although several studies have reported the clinical impact of respiratory viruses on critically ill patients39, further studies are needed to clarify the significance on those with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza viral infection in pulmonary ARDS has gained attention to intensivists due to high morbidity and mortality1011, but little data comparing characteristics and outcomes of the different types of viruses in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Moreover, differences in clinical outcomes between patients infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses have not been clearly elucidated.",

ARDS was fulfilled for the Berlin diagnostic criteria12. Among them, those who underwent RT-PCR for respiratory viral infection were reviewed. Respiratory specimens such as bronchial and endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab or sputum were obtained for RT-PCR analysis. AdvanSure RV real-time RT-PCR (LG Chemistry, Seoul, Korea) assay based on the multiplex polymerase chain reaction method was used to identify respiratory viruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, bocavrius, and coronavirus). Baseline (age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities) and clinical characteristics (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, clinical complications [shock, acute kidney injury], management, etc.) were assessed. Additionally, data from laboratory (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet, C-reactive protein [CRP] level, total protein level, albumin level, etc.), microbiologic data (types of respiratory virus, co-respiratory bacterial or fungal pathogens) and clinical outcomes (length of stay in ICU and hospital, mortality) were analyzed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gyeongsang National University Hospital (No. 2018-05-015). Informed consent was waived due to retrospective nature of the study.

The frequency of respiratory viral infection in pulmonary ARDS has not been established. The current study showed similar frequency of respiratory viral infection in pulmonary ARDS as those of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to the ICU. Respiratory viruses play a role in development and progression of ARDS8; therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical significance of them in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Several studies have reported clinical outcomes in patients infected with respiratory viruses receiving mechanical ventilation14151617. In the present study, clinical outcomes did not differ between patients with infected with influenza virus and those with other respiratory viruses. Similar clinical outcomes were reported in patients with respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus compared to influenza virus1718. In the current study, comparison of clinical outcomes in each respiratory viruses was not performed due to a few cases except for influenza virus.
