            "text": "Infection by both known and newly emerging RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, influenza virus and SARS-CoV, are a severe threat to public health. RNA viruses cause injury to the infected organs and disrupt normal functioning, leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality (1\u20133). RNA viruses exhibit genomic hyper-variation, mainly caused by low fidelity of the virus-derived RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (4,5). Instability of the RNA viral genome allows viruses to escape from virus-specific drugs and vaccines. Because the development of stable vaccines for RNA viruses is a challenging task, alternative tools that modulate the immune response against a viral infection are of great interest (6\u20138). Among them, IFN-based therapy shows a strong potential for HCV clearance by stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system of the infected host, although IFN resistance is often reported in HCV-infected patients. The concept of IFN-based therapy for virus eradication prompted the exploration of therapeutic agents that target innate immune systems of the infected host (9). In this regard, synthetic agonists for Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been successfully developed as potent IFN-inducers, and their potential to control viral replication and infection-related diseases has been extensively studied (6,8,10).",

            "text": "Early detection of the virus in the infected host relies on specific receptors that recognize virus-derived molecular patterns, such as double stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 5\u2032-triphosphate-single stranded RNA (ssRNA) (11). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 localize in the membrane of the endosomal compartment and sense non-self molecular patterns that are derived from the viral particles. In contrast, retinoic acid-inducible genes I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene five (MDA-5) detect molecular patterns derived from replicating RNA viruses in the cytoplasm (12). Upon recognition of the intracellular non-self RNA, both RIG-I and MDA5 proteins are recruited to the mitochondria, via association with Cardif (also called IPS-1, VISA or MAVS), and trigger IFN\u03b2 production and signaling through the activation of IRF3 and NF\u03baB (13). Although RIG-I and MDA5 utilize the same signaling pathways for IFN\u03b2 production, they exhibit differential preferences toward RNA substrates, and therefore detect different types of viruses. It has been suggested that an RNA structure with a 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety can be found during the replication of ssRNA viruses, such as HCV, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus, and that this structure is selectively recognized by RIG-I (14\u201317). Meanwhile, MDA5 preferentially detects long stretches of dsRNA structures, which are mainly produced by replicating Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or Reovirus (16,18,19). The significance of viral recognition and signaling cascades mediated by cytosolic RIG-I and MDA5 was well demonstrated in vivo using RIG-I or MDA5 knockout mice. RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit defects in the immune response against NDV, Sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, whereas MDA5\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit specific defects against EMCV infection (20).",

Due to their rapid selection process, high stability and relatively low immunogenicity, aptamers have become a favorite choice among molecular detection tools, replacing the use of antibodies (23). Furthermore, depending on the modes of action, aptamers are capable of modulating activities of target molecules, which facilitates the development of aptamers for therapeutic purposes (24\u201326). Most aptamers with anti-viral activity have been developed against virus-specific proteins, such as Tat of HIV or NS3 of HCV, and less effort has focused on aptamers that target the innate immune response against viral infection (22,27\u201329). In an attempt to develop aptamers that specifically control RIG-I-mediated anti-viral responses in the infected host cells, we screened RNA oligonucleotides specific for RIG-I using advanced-SELEX technology.",

RNA oligonucleotides bound to RIG-I were harvested, reverse transcribed and PCR amplified and then transcribed in vitro to generate RNA olibonucleotide pools for the next round of selection (Supplementary Figure S1). After 13 cycles of selection and amplification, 45 independent clones of RIG-I aptamers with unique sequences were obtained. Sequence analysis of the 45 clones indicated that the sequences of the selected RIG-I aptamers contained high U content (average 51.9%), with a repeated polyUn motif in the second half of the sequence (Figure 1B). Among individual aptamer clones, lengths of the repeated polyUn varied between n = 2 to n = 11 (Figure 1C). We chose eight independent RIG-I aptamer clones at random and examined for their in vitro binding affinity to purified RIG-I protein. For this purpose, individual RIG-I aptamers were end-labeled with 32P and were incubated with purified full-length RIG-I proteins in the absence or presence of tRNA as a competitor of non-specific binding (Figure 1C). Despite differences in their binding potentials, all of the tested RIG-I aptamers exhibited strong RIG-I binding ability compared to the control RNA (library). We attempted to measure in vitro binding affinity of the selected aptamers by estimating bound and free forms of labeled aptamer under equilibrium conditions using different amounts of RIG-I protein. For this purpose, we picked CL9, which showed relatively weak binding compared to the other clones, hence provides lower bound value of the selected aptamer. In vitro Bmax and Kd value of CL9 were 0.29 fmol/mg and 37.2 nM, respectively (Supplementary Figure S2).\n",

To test this possibility, the in vitro binding affinity of native and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-treated aptamers to RIG-I were directly compared (Figure 1D).

HepG2 cells express a fair amount of endogenous RIG-I protein and are therefore suitable for testing the regulatory effects of RIG-I aptamers (36,37). Every tested aptamer elicited stimulatory effects on the IFN\u03b2 promoter (PRDIII-I) (Figure 2A), and there were no significant differences between native and AP-treated aptamers, except for CL11. Efficacy of 5\u2032-triphosphate removal by AP was separately tested using chemically synthesized dsRNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate (Figure 2B). Reporter activity induced by 5\u2032-triphosphate-dsRNA has been significantly reduced by AP treatment, indicating that AP efficiently removes the 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety. To examine whether the regulatory effect of the screened aptamers depends RIG-I for their function, cells were transfected with RIG-I or MDA5 siRNA before aptamer treatment. The ability of RIG-I aptamer, CL9, to stimulate the IFN\u03b2-driven promoter activity was significantly impaired when RIG-I, but not MDA5, expression was reduced (Figure 2C). Functional knock-down of MDA5 was separately confirmed in the polyI:C stimulated cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Signaling activity of the RIG-I aptamer was then compared to those of the conventional ligands of RIG-I, 5\u2032-triphosphate-dsRNA or polyI:C (Figure 2D). Stimulating cells with 5\u2032-triphosphate-dsRNA induced IFN\u03b2 promoter activity, only when RIG-I was overexpressed in the HepG2 or Huh 7 human hepatoma cells. In contrast, CL9 exhibited moderate levels of the IFN\u03b2 promoter activity in the HepG2 and Huh7 cells, and this activity was further enhanced by RIG-I overexpression (Figure 2D). Depending on its length, polyI:C was reported to activate RIG-I and MDA5 differentially: Long (1\u201310 kb) strands of polyI:C bind to MDA5, while short (<1 kb) strands of polyI:C preferentially activate RIG-I (18). CL9 exhibited similar levels of signaling activity relative to long forms of polyI:C, and >10-fold higher activity than RNaseIII-digested, short form of polyI:C (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S4).\n",

In contrast, a long stretch of polyU motif was critical for its activity to produce IFN\u03b2, as partial substitution of consecutive \u2018U's to \u2018A's (pU-1, pU-2) almost completely abolished its activity (Figure 4B). Furthermore, complete substitution of polyU motif to poly A, C or G (pA, pC, pG) impaired its activity to induce IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression (Figure 4C). Interestingly, relative position of polyU motif within aptamer was critical, as ipU mutant which contains same nucleotide composition but internal polyU motif induces less IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression, compare to wt (Figure 4C). These results clearly indicate that a polyU motif within aptamer sequence plays critical roles in the activation of RIG-I-mediated IFN\u03b2 production.\n",

Although pU-1 and pU-2 mutants fail to activate IFN\u03b2 production, both of them exhibited comparable levels of RIG-I binding. These data suggest that RIG-I aptamer might not act as a conventional ligand for RIG-I, but function to stabilize the conformation of RIG-I in an active state. Finally, we examined the IFN\u03b2 production activity of CL9 synthesized with 2\u2032-OH-UTP and 2\u2032-OH-CTP (Figure 4F). Signaling activity of CL9 was completely abolished when conventional nucleotides were used instead of 2\u2032-F-UTP and 2\u2032-F-CTP, suggesting that 2\u2032-F-containing CL9 has a unique structural feature for RIG-I activation.",

These data indicate that CL9 requires an intact form of RIG-I to elicit its signaling activity. Because CL9 functions in a 5\u2032-triphosphate-independent manner, we wondered whether providing a 5\u2032-triphosphate-dsRNA moiety in trans can further enhance signaling activity of CL9. To test this idea, the signaling activity of CL9 in the absence or presence of 5\u2032-triphosphate-dsRNA was examined in the RIG-I overexpressed Huh7 cells (Figure 5E).

Therefore, we evaluated whether RIG-I aptamer has the potential to inhibit the replication of infected RNA viruses. To do this, HepG2 cells were infected with either NDV-GFP, or VSV-GFP, which both contain a gene coding Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the viral genome (38) (Supplementary Figure S6). To evaluate its therapeutic potential, cells were treated with CL9 3 h after virus infection, and viral replication was assayed 3 or 9 h later (Figure 6A). In contrast to the RNA library pools used as negative control, CL9 treatment efficiently blocked replication of NDV and VSV (Figure 6B and C). Similar effect on the repression of influenza A (PR8 strain)-GFP replication was also demonstrated in the cells treated with CL9 (Figure 6D). We then examined whether pre-treating cells with CL9 prior to viral infection had any preventative effects (Figure 7A). NDV replication was almost completely blocked when cells were treated with CL9 6 h before infection, visualized by fluorescence of GFP (Figure 7B and C) or PCR with virus specific primers (Figure 7D). Efficient induction of IFN\u03b2 mRNA by CL9 was separately verified (Figure 7E). These results suggest that RIG-I aptamer has strong potential to inhibit viral replication, via activation of RIG-I and IFN\u03b2 production.\n\n",

It binds dsRNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety via carboxyl-terminal RD domain of RIG-I (14,39,40). Double-stranded RNA of intermediate length (between 300 and 2000 bp) and blunt-ended short dsRNA (23 \u223c 30 bp) are also known to be recognized by RIG-I, although they lack 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety (12,41,42). RIG-I tends to have a preference for dsRNA, as ssRNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety fails to activate RIG-I (30). In contrast to the conventional ligands of RIG-I, the selected RIG-I aptamers seem to utilize distinct binding strategies: the 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety of the aptamer was not required for its binding to RIG-I, yet the helicase and C-terminal RD domains of RIG-I were essential for its binding. Because it has been reported that self-templated \u2018copy-back\u2019 activity of T7 RNA polymerase generates double-stranded RNA (34), we wondered whether in vitro transcribed RIG-I aptamer forms a dsRNA structure. When we evaluated the size of the transcribed RIG-I on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, in vitro transcribed RIG-I aptamer migrated to the position that matches the size of the single-stranded RIG-I aptamer (Supplementary Figure S7). In addition, its stimulating potential of RIG-I-mediated signaling activity was strictly dependent on the polyU motifs and its position within aptamer (Figure 4), rather than its physical binding to RIG-I, suggesting that the unique feature derived from the selected aptamer plays an important role in the activation of the RIG-I. It is noteworthy to mention that unanchored K63-poly-Ub chains have been reported to act as a potent ligand of RIG-I, thereby suggesting that there are another class of RIG-I ligand that functions non-conventional manner (43).",

Specifically, the polyU motif found near the 3\u2032 side of RIG-I aptamer, CL9, was essential for the activation of the RIG-I. This polyU motif is somewhat reminiscent of the polyU/UC in the RNA of replicating HCV, which has been identified as a strong ligand for RIG-I (44,45). However, a couple of differences exist between these two motifs. First, polyAG/A showed comparable activity to polyU/UC of HCV genome in the production of IFN\u03b2, but the replacement of U with polyA of CL9 almost completely blocked IFN\u03b2 expression. Second, the RIG-I activating signal of the polyU/UC in the HCV genome was diminished when 2\u2032-F-uridine was used instead of 2\u2032-OH-uridine. However, in vitro-synthesized CL9 with 2\u2032-F-uridine and 2\u2032-F-cytosine exhibited much stronger activity over transcripts generated with 2\u2032-OH-uridine and 2\u2032-OH-cytosine. It is noteworthy to mention that RNA aptamers synthesized with 2\u2032-F-uridine and 2\u2032-F-cytosine exhibits increased RNA stability compared to 2\u2032-OH-uridine and 2\u2032-OH-cytosine, due to the resistance to nuclease digestion (46). And finally, polyU/UC of HCV is reported to lose its activity after PAGE purification (44,45), but in vitro-synthesized CL9 keeps its activity after the same purification procedure. In all, these data indicate that RIG-I activation by RIG-I aptamer is quite distinct that of the polyU/UC sequence derived from the HCV RNA genome.",

            "text": "We propose that RIG-I aptamers can be potential tools based on their ability to enhance IFN\u03b2 production and block viral replication. Due to the immune-cell-restricted expression patterns of Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members and their localization on the surface membrane, reagents that target these proteins have been actively screened for the treatment of viral infection or inflammation-related diseases (47,48). In contrast, RIG-I is mainly expressed in non-immune cells and localizes in the cytoplasm, presenting technical difficulties associated with intracellular delivery of the targeting agents. Furthermore, RIG-I is mainly expressed in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (20), all of which express very low levels of TLRs, suggesting that reagents that target TLRs may not be ideal for systemic application. Instead, local application of RIG-I aptamers to the infected sites may present an attractive alternative. For example, local injection of RIG-I aptamers in olfactory or airway epithelial cells may be effective for treatment of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which are both recognized by RIG-I and are known to cause bronchiolitis and even pneumonia (15,49). In summary, we report RIG-I RNA aptamers have a strong tendency to stimulate IFN\u03b2 expression and block viral replication. Further studies to increase the efficacy and stability of RIG-I aptamers, as well as the development of cellular delivery tools, are necessary.",
