The RVP assay included testing for influenza A and B, RSV A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, as well as rhinovirus and enterovirus; however, the assay did not distinguish the latter 2 viruses, which heretofore will be noted as rhino/enterovirus. Hospitalized patients with a positive result in one of these tests during the study period were identified using our institutional infection control software system (TheraDoc; Premier, Charlotte, NC). A definite nosocomial respiratory viral infection was defined as a patient whose number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset exceeded the upper range for the incubation period of the identified virus (Table 1). A possible nosocomial respiratory viral infection case was defined as a patient in whom the number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset was within the range of the incubation period for the identified virus who were admitted without clinical signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection. A patient could be included more than once during the hospitalization if they had complete resolution of symptoms ascribed to the respiratory viral infection, recurrence of symptoms compatible with such an infection, and the time interval was greater than the above-noted incubation period. If the second such episode was due to a different virus, it was considered a definite case, and if it was due to the same virus, it was considered a possible case. Cases were assigned to a season based on the date when the symptoms of a respiratory viral infection were first documented in the medical record. Estimates of the incidence of nosocomial viral infections yearly in US acute care adult and pediatric hospitals were based on the number of such infections identified in the current study and the number of admissions to these hospitals during the 2014 fiscal reporting year based on data from the American Hospital Association.",

The median age of cases in the adult and pediatric hospitals was 56 and 1 year of age, respectively. Eleven (28%) of the cases were immunocompromised. In 6 cases, patients were in an ICU when they developed symptoms. In 5 other cases, after the nosocomial respiratory viral infection was identified, the patient was transferred to an ICU. The mean interval from symptom onset to ICU admission was 1.8 days. Two of these 5 cases, and 4 of the 10 cases already in an ICU, required mechanical ventilation after a mean interval of 5 and 0 days after symptom onset, respectively. In 17 of the 40 cases (43%), antibiotics were initiated at the time of symptom onset, and in 82% of the cases, the antibiotics were continued despite positive test results for the respiratory viral infection. It is unclear how many of these cases had bacterial coinfection. Fever (defined as temperature >38\u00b0C) and/or cough were the initial symptoms in over half of the cases (78% and 60%, respectively). Fever was the most common symptom among the pediatric patients (83%), whereas cough was the most common symptom among adult patients (77%). Congestion and rhinorrhea were present in 48% and 38% of patients, respectively. No adult patients had documented symptoms of vomiting or conjunctivitis associated with their viral infection; however, both were documented in pediatric patients (15% and 2.5%, respectively). No adult patients had a single isolated symptom at presentation, but fever was the only presenting symptom in 3 of the 23 pediatric cases.",

Overall, 1 in 229 admissions to our pediatric hospital developed a nosocomial respiratory viral infection. However, at its peak in the fall, 1 in 139 admissions to our pediatric hospital developed such an infection.

In one study, 23% of severe nosocomial pneumonia in adults were due to respiratory viruses [10]. For decades, it has been known that nosocomial respiratory viral infections are a particular problem in pediatric patients [11]. In one study, 1 in 6 children under the age of 4 hospitalized for 1 week or more during winter or spring developed a nosocomial respiratory viral infection [12]. However, detailed studies of noninfluenza nosocomial respiratory viral infections are limited, and, to our knowledge, our study is the only one that broadly assessed the incidence of these infections in both adult and pediatric patients in a nonepidemic setting in approximately 40 years (Table 4). We found that rhinovirus and/or enterovirus were the predominant viruses identified among nosocomial respiratory viral infections. A previous prospective cohort study demonstrated that rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus among children with viral respiratory infections, and approximately 20% of these infections were hospital acquired [13]. Similar to our findings, a pediatric study found that 73% of nosocomial respiratory infections were due to rhinovirus [14]. However, another pediatric study found that RSV and influenza were associated with 51% and 19% of such cases, respectively [2]. This may reflect differences in virologic diagnostic testing performed as well as the recognition of RSV in patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis at admission.",

            "text": "Seventy-nine percent and 81% of our hospital rooms are single occupancy for our adult and pediatric patients, respectively. During the study period, our hospital infection control policy stated that adult and pediatric patients presenting with influenza-like illness should be placed in contact and droplet precautions. However, we realize that influenza-like illness may be insensitive indicator for some respiratory viral infections [15]. Nevertheless, such patients were placed in a private room, or if no private room was available, they were cohorted with patients identified to have the same respiratory virus. Despite this policy, nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred. This most likely reflects inadequate screening of ill visitors and family or ill healthcare workers reporting for duty despite symptoms of a respiratory viral infection because these have not been stressed in recent educational efforts, and our hospital did not have a formal screening program for visitors and staff. However, based on an educational campaign and compliance monitoring, we believe that transmission of such infections in the hospital setting was less likely to be due to noncompliance with the policy, inadequate decontamination of the inanimate environment, or suboptimal hand hygiene compliance. Our hospital occupational health policy followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating risk of influenza transmission from infected healthcare workers to patients that uses fever as a determining factor for which healthcare workers should not have patient contact [16]. However, such guidelines may be inadequate as previously noted [17]. Unfortunately, fever is an insensitive indicator of influenza infection in adult healthcare workers at onset of symptoms when there may be maximal risk of transmission [18, 19]. At least 1 reported influenza outbreak involved healthcare providers who apparently worked with mild illness [20]. Nevertheless, the vast majority of our patients\u2019 nosocomial respiratory viral infections were not due to influenza. Thus, hospital policies and national guidelines should focus on reducing patient risk from all respiratory viruses, not just influenza.",

Thus, cases of nosocomial respiratory viral infections are often unrecognized. In addition, healthcare providers may not have a high index of suspicion for such hospital-acquired viral infections. As more hospitals use improved laboratory testing for such viruses, there will be a greater appreciation of the risk of such infections in hospitalized patients, a better understanding of their modes of transmission, and ultimately fewer such cases in the future [21]. Educating healthcare providers regarding the risk they pose to their patients when they are infected with respiratory viruses is vitally important, as well as changes in the culture of healthcare providers by dealing with the guilt they feel when they do not report to work with symptoms of a respiratory viral infection [22].",

We also may have missed cases in patients who had symptom onset after hospital discharge. Our data was collected over 1 year on 1 hospital campus in the Northeastern United States, and it may not reflect the risk of such infections in different geographic regions, in hospitals with different patient populations, or those with different infection control and occupational health policies. Finally, the retrospective nature of our study required us to rely on established documentation in the patient\u2019s medical record. Despite these limitations, we hope our findings will lead to a greater awareness of such infections and changes in hospital infection control policies regarding testing of patients with suggestive symptomatology, assessment of visitor restriction policies, and review of sick leave policies to potentially mitigate risk of such infections in future patients.",

The first such study [5] involving patients hospitalized from 1977 through 1979 had a very similar incidence of such pediatric and adult infections compared with our findings. That study tested for fewer respiratory viruses than our study; nevertheless, the data suggest that little has changed regarding the risk of such hospital-acquired infections now nearly 40 years later. We hope that our findings will provide additional support for more frequent testing to identify respiratory viruses, beyond influenza, in hospitalized patients with new onset of respiratory symptoms suggestive of possible viral infection to aid in focusing infection control efforts and to stimulate a search for effective therapies and vaccines.",
