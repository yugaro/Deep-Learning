He had history of nasal congestion, cough, and fever for five days. He was initially diagnosed with Bell\u2019s palsy and started on prednisone. The patient returned to the ED two days later with new onset right shoulder and arm weakness. He was tachypneic to 32 breaths/minute, tachycardic to 108 beats/minute, and afebrile with normal blood pressure. He was alert and oriented with Glasgow coma scale 15/15. Neurological examination was significant for left facial drooping and inability to fully close his left eye. He had neck weakness as well and was unable to hold his head unsupported. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength in the right upper extremity was 1/5 proximally and 4/5 distally. He had normal strength of left upper extremity and both lower extremities. Reflexes were absent in right biceps and brachioradialis, but normal on the left side. There was no sensory disturbance or numbness. There were no gait abnormalities and no bladder or bowel incontinence. The rest of his physical examination was normal. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild pleocytosis of 18/mm3 with 76% lymphocytes and 22% monocytes. CSF protein 52 mg/dL, and glucose 61 mg/dL. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and cervical spine revealed cord swelling with T2 prolongation and without contrast enhancement extending from the brain stem at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles through the medulla and the cervical spinal cord to the C7 level. No other area of abnormal signal was present (Figures 1 and 2). These findings are most consistent with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) due to involvement of \u22653 vertebral segments.",

A three-day course of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) was started, followed by plasmapheresis due to lack of improvement on steroids, in addition to doxycycline (to treat his Mycoplasma infection). The patient was monitored closely in the intensive care unit. His respiratory status remained stable and he did not require ventilatory support. He did not develop any signs of autonomic instability such as bradycardia or hypertension. He had no urinary retention or constipation.

Rapid progression of symptoms in less than 4 hours indicates an ischemic event while progression of symptoms beyond 3 weeks is more consistent with chronic hereditary myelopathy.1,3",

Patients may develop initial flaccid motor weakness and hyporeflexia similar to this case. This is usually due to initial spinal shock which results in lower motor neuron signs.1-3 Sensory symptoms include positive symptoms such burning sensation or negative symptoms such numbness. Patients usually have sensory loss in a band-like or transverse level (and here is the name transverse myelitis). Autonomic symptoms are virtually seen in all patients with ATM. These might include urinary retention and constipation.1-3 MRI spine is an essential tool in the diagnosis. It helps exclude extrinsic compression lesions like tumors or arteriovenous malformation. MRI spine in ATM shows centrally located lesions with high T2 signal intensity involving grey matter and neighboring white matter. Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), which is defined as involvement of \u22653 vertebral segments, occurs in 66-85% of ATM in children.2 Brain MRI is expected to be normal in ATM. However; asymptomatic lesions are seen in more than 40% of children with ATM indicating the need to include brain MRI in evaluation for ATM.2",
