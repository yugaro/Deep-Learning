Moreover, the primary target cells of PRRSV are alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and the virus causes disease primarily in the lungs.5,6 Intranasal immunization is not only efficient in stimulating protective immune responses in the lungs but also elicits immune responses at distant sites, such as gastric and genital mucosa.7",

Soluble vaccine antigens entrapped in PLGA NPs of up to 5 \u03bcm in size have been shown to protect encased antigen/drug from enzymatic or ionic degradation in vivo.23,24 Immunization with NP (200\u2013600 nm size range) vaccines enhances IFN\u03b3 production, long-lasting antigen-specific T-cell response, and production of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies.25\u201328",

Comparative responses of cells unstimulated or restimulated with MN184 Ags helped to detect virus-specific lymphocyte responses. PRRSV antigen-specific recall IFN\u03b3 response was not detectable in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset (Figure 6A). However, in group 6 pigs (both vaccine doses) a significant increase in IFN\u03b3+CD8+ lymphocyte response in stimulated compared to unstimulated cells was detected (Figure 6B), suggesting that CD8+ cells were primed adequately in vivo in group 6 pigs. Irrespective of in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes in pig groups 4, 5, and 6, there was an increase in the frequency of IFN\u03b3+ lymphocyte subsets like CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 6A\u2013C). PRRSV-antigen stimulation in group 6 pigs showed significantly increased frequency of total IFN\u03b3-producing cells (Figure 6D and E) at both vaccine doses. When the virus-specific lymphocyte response was compared among the tested pig groups in stimulated cells, the high-dose group 6 pigs had significantly increased IFN\u03b3+CD4+CD8\u2212 and IFN\u03b3+CD8+CD4\u2212 cells compared to group 2 and groups 2 and 3, respectively (Figure 6N and O). The IFN\u03b3+CD4+CD8+ cells were significantly higher in group 6 pigs compared to groups 3 and 5; and a similar trend was also observed in group 2 pigs (Figure 6P). An increased frequency of activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in group 6 pigs was detected compared to other groups (Table 2b). Significantly increased IFN\u03b3+ \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell population in group 6 pigs was detected compared to group 2 pigs (Figure 6Q).

A recent study has estimated that a dose of PLGA NP-based vaccine could be reduced by as much as 63 times compared to administration of a Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant emulsified vaccine.80 Although in pigs vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg (100 \u03bcg/pig/dose) vaccine, a substantial level of immune response was elicited, the virus clearance was not satisfactory, indicating the need for a suitable vaccine dose (500 \u03bcg/dose) for better viral clearance.
