The National Immunization Program registered 89,580,203 doses used in this campaign. The applied doses and immunization coverage for the target population in the 2010 campaign were: health workers (2,985,774; 120.33%), indigenous people (507,851; 90.62%), pregnant women 10- 49 years old (2,324,666; 77.14%), patients with chronic diseases \u2265 60 years old (8,511,628; 219.05%) and children < 2 years old (5,580,671; 127.52%) (31). As in 2010, an important reduction in the number of cases of flu, in morbidity and mortality rates was observed probably due to this extensive vaccination campaign. ",
