These date ranges were chosen to correspond to the dates reported in published articles. For the outbreak in Jeddah in 2014, for symptomatic cases (191 of 255 cases; 75%), the date given for each case represents the date of onset of illness; for asymptomatic cases (64 of 255 cases; 25%), the date given represents the date of the test for MERS-CoV [11]. For the outbreak in Riyadh in 2014, for symptomatic cases (41 of 45 cases; 91%), the date given for each case represents the date of onset of illness; for asymptomatic cases (4 of 45 cases; 9%), the date given represents the date of virus detection [12]. In addition, we counted weekly searches related to MERS in Riyadh from June 20, 2015 to October 3, 2015 and compared them with cases reported by the World Health Organization [13]. We considered relevant search terms to be those related to MERS, coronaviruses, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or mechanical ventilation.",
