The upper estimate was derived from the 2016 World Bank report that provides estimates of the economic impact on the 3 West African countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea) that experienced the majority of Ebola cases3,11 (Table 2). We derived this percentage decline in GDP by using as a numerator the estimated outbreak-related GDP dollar loss of $2.2 billion in 2015 (approximately 1 year after the onset of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa) (Table 2). As the denominator, we used a GDP value of $13.5 billion, totaled for all 3 countries (Table 2). This latter value is the estimated GDP for those 3 countries if the Ebola outbreak had not occurred. Per country values for these estimates are provided in Table 2. These declines in GDP were not even across all sectors of the affected countries. For example, the biggest Ebola-related declines in Liberia were seen in agriculture, mining, and services. Each of these sectors experienced more than 50% reduction in GDP growth, and together they accounted for approximately 95% reduction in GDP (Appendix Table 1, supplementary material: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0052).",

The complex World Bank model of the economic impact is based on estimates of Ebola epidemic\u2013induced changes in demand and production in 6 sectors (agriculture, natural resources, trade, manufacturing, transport, and services) in each country. The World Bank report provided results from a number of models, which were built using a variety of assumptions. We used the results from the World Bank model labeled by those authors as \u201cHigh Ebola scenario.\u201d In this World Bank model, it was assumed that the West African Ebola epidemic would eventually cause approximately 200,000 cases.12 This assumption is almost 10-fold greater than what actually occurred in the West African Ebola epidemic.2 In our illustrative outbreak scenario, however, we assume that the greatest impact occurs from an initially uncontained outbreak that causes cases in 9 countries (Table 1). These countries contain more than 2.5 billion people, with many living in urban areas with very high population densities.13 Under our assumptions, it is not necessarily unrealistic to assume that an initially uncontained outbreak that spreads to all 9 scenario countries would cause more than 100,000 cases.",
