            "text": "The medical records of all cats diagnosed with AMG, between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion into the present study. Criteria used for inclusion consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase (CK), and a CBC. The diagnosis of AMG was based on clinical signs compatible with the disease and an abnormal serum anti\u2010AChR antibody concentration. Serum anti\u2010AChR antibody concentration was measured by immunoprecipitation radio\u2010immunoassay using a feline\u2010specific antigen with a diagnostic value of 0.3 nmol/L.9 All imaging studies of the thorax were interpreted by a board\u2010certified veterinary radiologist. Criteria used for exclusion were the presence of an identifiable CMM on thoracic imaging or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. The wheelbarrow exercise stress test (WEST) was employed during the neurological examination of some cats in an attempt to evaluate their degree of skeletal muscle strength and tolerance to exercise. This test involved elevating and supporting the caudal half of the body while moving the cat forward thereby promoting ambulation through the thoracic limbs (Video S1). The medical records were reviewed for signalment, history, reasons for referral, general and neurological examination findings, diagnostic tests performed, treatment, short\u2010term follow\u2010up, long\u2010term outcome, and repeated measurement of serum anti\u2010AChR antibody concentration if performed. When undertaken, electromyography (EMG) was conducted under general anesthesia in normothermic cats by a board\u2010certified veterinary neurologist, at least 7 days after the onset of clinical signs, using a disposable bipolar concentric needle electrode. Skeletal muscles evaluated as part of EMG studies consisted of the appendicular and epaxial muscles, as well as those of the head. Nerve conduction and repetitive nerve stimulation studies were not routinely performed as part of a neuromuscular workup in these 2 veterinary referral hospitals during the inclusion period. Throughout this study, the term immune remission was used to define the absence of clinical signs of AMG along a with a normal serum anti\u2010AChR antibody concentration after discontinuation of treatment, whereas spontaneous remission referred to the resolution of clinical signs of AMG alongside normalization of serum anti\u2010AChR antibody concentration in the absence of any treatment. Short\u2010term follow\u2010up information was obtained approximately 2 weeks after initial presentation in all cats upon informing their owner of the diagnosis. Long\u2010term outcome was evaluated through an interview with the owner 6 months after diagnosis alongside a repeated general and neurological examination of their cat if alive, as well as a final interview at the time of writing of this study if their cat was still alive 6 months after confirmation of the diagnosis.",

Some were deteriorating or plateauing while others waxed and waned or improved with time, and neurological examination abnormalities at the time of initial examination ranged from absent to severe skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It is reasonable to consider that the immune\u2010mediated basis of AMG in cats is a continuous spectrum of disease, ranging from severe and acute fulminating skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability through to potentially subclinical and chronic skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability.

Additionally, skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability can be subtle in cats with AMG. An advantage of the WEST is the ability to generate physical activity in order to evaluate skeletal muscle strength and tolerance to exercise. The WEST was employed in an attempt to induce or exacerbate any skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability, particularly in cats with vague clinical signs. In the present study, 5 of the 6 cats evaluated demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability progressing to exhaustion within 1 minute of this activity and were not able to resume normal ambulation until a short period of rest (Video S1). This included 1 cat in which neuromuscular disease was uncertain from the neurological examination as the only abnormality was intermittent appendicular skeletal muscle tremors. Upon performing the WEST, it became apparent that the cat was intolerant to exercise and that the appendicular skeletal muscle tremors might have represented appendicular skeletal muscle weakness. The only cat in which the WEST did not reveal evidence of skeletal muscle weakness nor fatigability had a normal neurological examination and had been described to have already improved by the owners at the time of initial presentation. Skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability induced or exacerbated by the WEST were the most consistent neurological examination abnormalities associated with AMG in this study.",

None of the cats required supportive therapy as there were no specific issues to address such as dehydration, regurgitation/dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, or respiratory difficulties due to weakness and fatigue of the respiratory skeletal muscles. None of the cats received treatment with anticholinesterase agents. Anticholinesterase agents have been successfully reported in the treatment of AMG in cats.3, 4 Prednisolone used at an immunosuppressive dose has also been successful in the treatment of AMG in cats3, 4 and has been suggested to be more beneficial than anticholinesterase agents.3, 7 Not only do corticosteroids address the underlying etiology, they can also increase neuromuscular transmission,23 and cats appear tolerant to the adverse effects of prednisolone, even at high doses.3, 4, 7 In agreement with the latter, none of our cats experienced adverse effects including deterioration of their degree of skeletal muscle weakness after administration of an immunosuppressive course of prednisolone.

Moreover, the natural history of feline AMG includes spontaneous remission when there is no evidence of a CMM. Attempting to rule out the presence of a CMM therefore refines prognosis, and treatment is not always necessary in this disease population. Additionally, clinical presentation was heterogeneous, comprising cats that were improving or with a normal neurological examination at the time of presentation, and skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability induced or exacerbated by the WEST were the most consistent neurological examination abnormalities associated with AMG in cats in this study.",
