We chose 14 surveillance points located on the mountainsides of the\nnorthern (A to E in Fig. 1A and Table 1), western (F to K) and eastern (L to N) parts of Kyoto City. The vegetation at\nthese locations consisted mainly of short grasses. Ticks on the plants were captured by a\nstandard flagging method [26]. Ticks were also\ncollected from 5 wild boars hunted in Yamashina-ku (O) for the harmful wildlife control.\nAdult and nymph ticks were placed in sample bottles containing wet filter paper and taken\nback to our diagnostic laboratory. They were anesthetized with chloroform. Tick larvae were\nplaced into 70% ethanol. Each tick species was determined by its morphological index [33].",

They belonged to 3 genera including 4 species: Haemaphysalis\n(H.) longicornis, H. flava,\nAmblyomma (A.) testudinarium and\nDermacentor (D.) taiwanensis (Table 2). One hundred and ninety four ticks (96.5%)\nwere identified as H. longicornis. Twenty four, 30 and 140 ticks were male,\nfemale and nymph, respectively. Of these, 21 ticks were captured from 5 wild boars. Two\nH. flava nymphs, 4 A. testudinarium nymphs and 1 adult\nD. taiwanensis female were also examined. To extract DNA from the ticks,\ncollected ticks stored in 70% ethanol were washed with distilled water. These ticks were\nplaced on slide glass and covered with 100 \u00b5l of phosphate buffered saline\n(PBS). After placing cover glasses on top, they were crushed using the head of a tooth pick.\nThe fluid was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used as a DNA template. A PCR was\nperformed using the genus-specific primer pair of RpCS877, 5\u2032-GGGGGCCTGCTCACGGCGG and\nRpCS1258, 5\u2032-ATTGCAAAAAGTACAGTGAACA for the rickettsial citrate synthase\n(gltA) gene [25]. The reaction was\ncarried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq (TAKARA BIO, Otsu, Japan) with a 20 \u00b5l\nreaction mixture containing 2 \u00b5l of template DNA, 200 \u00b5M\neach of dNTP and 1 \u00b5M each of primer. Following initial denaturation at\n95\u00b0C for 10 min, 5 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 60 sec, annealing at 53\u00b0C for 60 sec\nand extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec were performed. Then, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for\n60 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 60 sec and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec were followed. The\nfinal extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The Rickettsia 17-kDa\ngenus-common antigen (17K antigen) gene was also amplified using the primer pair R1;\n5\u2032-TCAATTCACAACTTGCCATT-3\u2032 and R2; 5\u2032-TTTACAAAATTCTAAAAACC-3\u2032 [1]. Nested PCR was performed with a primer pair, Rj5;\n5\u2032-CGCCATTCTACGTTACTACC-3\u2032 and Rj10; 5\u2032-ATTCTAAAAACCATATACTG-3\u2032 to detect the sequence of\nR. japonica DNA using the 100 times diluted PCR products which were\namplified with primer pair of R1 and R2 as a template [9]. The reaction was carried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq with a 20 \u00b5l\nreaction mixture containing 2 \u00b5l of template DNA, 200 \u00b5M\neach of dNTP and 1 \u00b5M of each primer. After initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C\nfor 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 57\u00b0C for 2 min and\nextension at 70\u00b0C for 2 min were carried out. The final extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for\n7 min. The PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Wizard\u00ae SV\nGel and PCR and Clean-Up System; Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), and the sequences of\namplified products were determined by cycle sequencing.",

Rickettsial DNA was detected at all the 8\nsurveillance locations where H. longicornis was collected (Table 2 and Fig.\n1C). The surveillance points were located in various regions in the city.\nH. longicornis, which was the most abundant tick in this study, and of\nwhich 78% were positive for rickettsial DNA, appeared to be the dominant carrier of\nrickettsial DNA in the area surveyed. H. longicornis is well known as a\nhuman-biting tick and is considered to be a competent vector of R. japonica\nin Japan [27]. Previously, rickettsial DNA was\ndetected in various amounts in H. longicornis obtained from different areas\nin the north and south of Japan [14, 16]. The detection of R. japonica has\npreviously been reported in various areas in Japan [14, 27]. The study on the prevalence of\nrickettsia in ticks in the Ehime prefecture, where over 70 cases of Japanese spotted fever\nhave been reported during the past decade [24],\nshowed that rickettsial DNA was detected in 12.6% of ticks using the same primer pairs as\nused in this study [19]. On the other hand, 62.2% of\nthe ticks appeared to be positive for PCR using Rj5 and Rj10 as the primer set for\nR. japonica in the present study. The sequences of the detected DNA\nsegments were analyzed and found to have 98.5% similarity with R. japonica\nYH strain which was isolated from a patient with Japanese spotted fever. The phylogenic tree\nrevealed their sequences clustered with the spotted fever group rickettsiae, including\nR.rickettsii and R. conorii, the causative agent of\nRocky Mountain spotted fever and Mediterranean spotted fever, respectively. As cases of\nrickettsiosis have never been reported in the area where we studied, in spite of the high\nprevalence of rickettsiae in ticks collected, their pathogenicity is still unclear. The\nsequences of the 17K antigen gene fragment were identical to those of the rickettsia related\nspecies, LON-13, which was detected in ticks and considered to be of low pathogenicity\n[32]. It is important to study the pathogenicity of\nthese rickettsiae for accurate diagnosis. A. testudinarium is also a\npossible vector of rickettsia in this area, although further studies are needed because only\na limited number of ticks were tested in this study.",
