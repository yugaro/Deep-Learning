The first patient, a so-called super spreader, had the highest transmission rate of the virus, which eventually resulted in 186 confirmed cases [1]. An increase in MERS-CoV disease activity raised concerns of a pandemic. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lower respiratory tract infection that causes fever, coughing, breathing difficulties, and pneumonia. The condition may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure and leads to death in 20\u201340% of those infected. Human-to-human transmission occurs through droplet spread. Owing to the highly contagious nature of MERS, individuals suspected of exposure to the virus are quarantined.",

This helped to build acquaintance with the patient and give personal familiarity when receiving their first telephone call. Daily telephone calls were offered as psychiatric rounding to check any sleep or mood disturbances. Further face-to-face interview was done if requested by the patient or when acute psychiatric symptoms emerged.

Relevant biological factors may be weight loss of 10 kg to 20 kg [11], antiviral agent side effects [12], pre-existing disabilities (e.g., blindness or hearing impairment), or a history of psychiatric disorders. Relevant psychological factors include tension, fear, anger, mistrust, and depressed mood due to MERS and subsequent isolation during quarantine [2]. Additionally, we found that the level of daily distress over the past month and post-traumatic stress symptoms may be risk factors for depression during acute hospital quarantine. Social factors that may have led to unhappiness during treatment include financial losses attributable to isolation and separation from young children or parents at home.",
