            "text": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) can simultaneously measure gene expression in many different samples for a limited number of genes, and is especially suitable when only a small number of cells are available. It has become the standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. In case of qRT-PCR, the use of reference genes as internal controls is the most common method for normalizing mRNA data (Huggett et al., 2005). The reference gene is a stably expressed gene that is experimentally verified in given species and tissues under given experimental conditions. However, an increasing number of reports have shown that the expression of some frequently used internal reference genes may vary significantly under different experimental conditions (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Nygard et al., 2007; Facci et al., 2011). If the chosen reference gene has a large expression fluctuation among samples tested, the normalization will lead to erroneous gene expression profiles of the target gene of interest. Therefore, the selection of the most stable gene or set of genes as internal controls is a critical step to control the variability among samples for quantitative gene expression studies with a sensitive qRT-PCR technique.",

As in vitro models, they have been widely used to dissect the pathogenesis and genetics behind infection and stimulation through gene expression studies (Gao et al., 2010; Uddin et al., 2012). Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) is an analogue of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that can serve as pathogen-associated molecular pattern and activates innate immunity through two major dsRNA sensors, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and melanoma differentiation associated protein-5 (MDA5) (McCartney et al., 2009). Using the poly I:C as an immunologic stimulant is an important experimental measure to study the immune regulation of an organism to RNA viruses (Caskey et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2013).",

In brief, geNorm calculates the gene expression stability measure M for a reference gene as the average pairwise variation V for that gene with all other tested reference genes. Besides the M values, geNorm also calculates average expression stability values of remaining control genes during stepwise exclusion of the least stable control gene. Finally, to determine the optimal number of control genes for normalization, by the program, we calculated the pairwise variation Vn/Vn+1 between two sequential normalization factors NFn and NFn+1 containing an increasing number of reference genes. NormFinder uses the model-based strategy to estimate not only the overall expression variation of the candidate normalization genes, but also the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set, i.e. non-stimulation group and stimulation group in the study. The output of the program provides a stability value for each gene, which is a direct measure for the estimated expression variation enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene for normalization.",

But to date, there is no consensus on which method should be used to examine reference gene expression stability. In particular, Radoni et al.

A comparison of different algorithms of reference gene selection allows a better evaluation of the most reliable controls and reduces the risk of artificial selection of co-regulated transcripts.

As experimental data from the geNorm developers have shown that stably expressed genes typically exhibit mean M values lower than 0.5 in relatively homogeneous sample panels (Hellemans et al., 2007). Thus, the combining of the two genes, PPIA and B2M, is appropriate for normalization of gene expression of whole blood and PBMC. On the other hand, based on the NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene in both whole blood and PBMC, while genes B2M and PPIA were the second and third ones.

Based on the cut-off value of 0.15 proposed by geNorm program, four reference genes are necessary to obtain the lowest control genes in the tested samples of both whole blood and PBMC. In practice, it is not always possible to measure multiple reference genes due to limited sample availability and cost. Additionally, the cut-off value of 0.15 is an empirical value and should not be taken as a too strict cut off value, as it is already suggested by the geNorm manual itself.
