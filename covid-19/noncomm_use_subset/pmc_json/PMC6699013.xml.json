Prior to referral, the cat had been assessed by the\nprimary veterinarian and management included polyethylene glycol 3350 (\u00bd tsp PO q12h\n[MiraLAX; Bayer)] and a prescription canned gastrointestinal diet (Royal Canin\nGastro-intestinal High Energy; Royal Canin). When clinical signs progressed, the\nfrequency of polyethylene glycol 3350 administration was increased to q8h, and\nlactulose (Patrin Pharma) was added at 3 ml (~0.5 g/kg [PO q8h]). Progression of\nclinical signs also prompted further diagnostics, including abdominal radiographs,\nwhich revealed a sublumbar, space-occupying soft tissue mass with ventral deviation\nand displacement with partial obstruction of the descending colon. Formed\nheterogeneous feces and colonic distention was noted in the descending colon cranial\nto the mass effect. Blood was submitted for feline leukemia virus (FeLV)\nimmunofluorescence assay, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Western blot and\nBartonella Western blot. The cat was negative for FeLV/FIV but\npositive for Bartonella species (3+ on a 4+ scale) and was\nprescribed azithromycin (9.1 mg/kg PO q24h for 1 month [Teva Pharmaceuticals]).\nReferral to PUVTH was recommended after 7\u201310 days of suspected obstipation.",

Although the available\nliterature indicates that multimodal therapy including immunosuppressive medication\nand surgical excision provides the best outcome, complete surgical excision of the\nprimary mass was not pursued in this case. This was following a discussion with the\nowner prior to surgery who expressed a desire to avoid significant morbidity\nassociated with pubic symphysiotomy, which would have been required to attempt\ncomplete resection of the masses. Given the current clinical signs and an almost\n4.6-fold reduction in the size of the mass, medical management was considered\nsuccessful.",
