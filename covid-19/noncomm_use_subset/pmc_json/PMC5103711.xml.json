The lack of effective therapy for ONFH is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in clinical practice. Several methods have been used to treat early-stage ONFH, such as drug therapy, core decompression, vascularized bone grafting and rotational osteotomy. However, the clinical results of these methods are not satisfactory (3,4).",

Prior studies have found that the implantation of MSCs into the necrotic area of the femoral head was able to improve local bone regeneration (11,12). MSCs are able to differentiate into osteoblasts to promote local bone healing directly (13,14). Furthermore, MSCs are able to secrete growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 1, stromal cell-derived factor 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which have angiogenic potency and can promote local revascularization, thereby improving bone healing indirectly (15,16).",

Currently, the treatment methods of early-stage ONFH are highly controversial (28).

Jones hypothesized that new capillaries could only penetrate 10\u201315 mm of necrotic bone, and subchondral bone tissue usually can not be repaired (33). Furthermore, microfractures of the subchondral bone may retard capillary penetration, and then the loaded areas would collapse (33).

Therefore, MSCs have been employed to aid core decompression to treat early-stage ONFH (11,12,37). Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1\u03b1) is an important functional subunit of the HIF family, which are crucial mediators of the adaptive cells response to hypoxia (17). HIF-1\u03b1 arose early in evolution, and is widely expressed in most human tissues (17). A previous study found that HIF-1\u03b1 controls the expression of numerous genes in cells, cell proliferation and differentiation (38). Our previous study showed that, compared with normal MSCs, HIF-1\u03b1 transgenic MSCs had improved osteogenic and angiogenic capacity in vitro and better potential to promote bone regeneration in the necrotic area of the femoral head (19).",

At normal oxygen tension, HIF-1\u03b1 is modified by oxygen dependent prolyl hydroxylases, resulting in rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22). Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase activity decreases and HIF-1\u03b1 is stabilized (39). DMOG is able to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase activity at normal oxygen tension, thus leading to HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression in cells. DMOG has been used to treat ischemic skeletal muscles, middle cerebral artery occlusion and ischemic myocardial injury, and all resulted in good outcomes in previous experiments (40\u201342). Our previous study showed that DMOG could significantly enhance VEGF production in ASCs and improved the osteogenic differentiation potential of ASCs in vitro by stabilizing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in ASCs, and DMOG-treated ASCs had an increased bone healing capacity and promoted local revascularization in critical defects (22). In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of implanting DMOG-treated ASCs to treat early-stage corticosteroid-induced ONFH.",

In the present model, osteonecrosis was induced by a combination of LPS and MPS to mimic the pathological mechanism of steroid-induced ONFH. It has been reported that this inductive protocol has a high incidence of ONFH, and resulted in nearly no death, and suggested that numerous histopathological and pathogenetic features of steroid-induced ONFH in rabbits are similar to those observed in human early-stage ONFH (25). Therefore, the steroid-induced rabbit ONFH model may be effective for testing the efficacy of the method developed for treatment of steroid-associated ONFH for clinical application and confirmation of their long-term effects in prevention of subchondral bone collapse of the hips.",

Micro-CT and histological results indicated there was increased bone regeneration in the normal ASCs group than in the group that underwent core decompression only, which suggests that ASCs could improve bone healing on their own. Increased newly formed bone was observed in the DMOG-treated ASCs group than in the normal ASCs group, which indicated DMOG could enhance the bone healing capacity of ASCs in the necrotic area. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry detection of CD31 showed that vessels formation was also increased in the DMOG-treated ASCs group than in the other three groups. This may be because DMOG could increase the expression and secretion of certain angiogenic factors in ASCs in vivo by stabilizing the HIF-1\u03b1 expression in cells, which has been demonstrated by previous experiments (43). It is hypothesized that angiogenesis is closely associated with osteogenesis, and that neovascularization is an favorable element in bone regeneration. Therefore, the improved local blood supply may also contribute to bone healing in the necrotic area.",
