            "text": "Human influenza viruses cause seasonal influenza, a globally widespread respiratory illness giving rise to ~ 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness every year [1]. Influenza viruses can also be found in other mammals and birds, and the greatest diversity of influenza viruses occurs in aquatic birds [2]. Most strains of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) do not pose a risk to human health. Some strains however, e.g. subtypes H7N9 [3] and H5N1 [4], have acquired the ability to cross the species-barrier and infect humans who come into close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments [5]. Occasionally, animal influenza viruses cause global pandemics in humans, as happened three times in the 20th century and most recently in 2009 [6], [7]. Surveillance of avian influenza viruses is important to identify new strains that may pose a pandemic threat [8].",

Permanent LPM closure encounters strong public resistance [17]. Nonetheless, Chinese LPMs were temporarily closed during both H7N9-waves [18]. Hong Kong's LPMs implemented monthly [19] or bimonthly [20] rest days and an overnight poultry storage ban [21]. Similarly, LPM-systems in the North-Eastern USA have introduced regular depopulation and disinfection of all markets in 2002 [22], [23], [24].",

In Shanghai, the temporary closure and disinfection of 464 LPMs was combined with a poultry import ban [18]. According to He and colleagues, four H7N9-cases were reported during the first post-intervention incubation period, but no additional cases followed [18]. As soon as the ban was lifted in January 2014, 8 new cases were reported within a month. LPM-closure was re-implemented and H7N9-incidence declined again to zero [18].",

These two studies convincingly demonstrated that both frequent rest days [20], [21] and a ban on holding live poultry overnight [21] were effective in reducing H9N2-transmission within the LPM. The overnight ban is particularly effective, because it limits the length of stay of the birds in the markets, removing susceptible or newly infected birds from the LPM before they become infectious themselves. This identifies the birds' length of stay and the AIV-incubation period between infection and onset of transmission as critical control points of AIV-circulation, as also postulated by mathematical models [36].",

For instance, AIV-transmission within bird populations in Chinese markets was not particularly sensitive to regular LPM-depopulation in the long-run [26]. Accordingly, even though the monthly rest day in Hong Kong had an immediate impact on H9N2-circulation [19], it did not significantly reduce average isolation rates over longer time periods [20], [21]. Over the years, the live quail sale ban induced a comparatively much more dramatic risk reduction of AIV-isolation compared to one or even two monthly rest days, although the ban of keeping poultry overnight led to the most sustained impact [21]. The impact of the ban on the sale of live quails was context-dependent, as it was introduced based on previous research demonstrating that quails were the species with the highest virus shedding rates within Hong Kong LPMs at the time of the investigations.",

The studies in Hong Kong were of necessity carried out with subtype H9N2, which is more endemic in incoming poultry than, for example, the more clinically relevant H5N1. When virus prevalence is very high in incoming birds, viral amplification within the LPM would be a less significant factor in determining overall zoonotic exposure. In this case, even the ban on holding live poultry overnight might fail to substantially reduce human exposure (Fig. 2). In the case of AIV strains that have lower prevalence within incoming poultry, it is possible that even the monthly or bimonthly rest days would significantly reduce overall exposure of humans to the zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2).",

For instance, the effectiveness of the overnight ban would be greatly compromised, if residual poultry was simply moved to an \u201coff-site\u201d holding facility and re-introduced into the market the next day. Considering the poor knowledge about AIVs [38] and low perceived self-infection risk [39] among LPM workers, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the motivation to adhere to a rigorous implementation of these interventions and to carry out effective disinfection of the premises may decline over time. To date, the relative contribution of the disinfection of the market to the observed impact of rest days or overnight bans is not elucidated. Emptying of the facilities may already be sufficient to reduce residual viral load through thermal inactivation of the virus infectivity. Additional studies using virus isolation (rather than RT-PCR, which does not discriminate between live and dead virus) are needed to address these questions.",

Aside from the very different sampling schedules, with time windows ranging from < 14 days [19], [23], [27] to year-long surveillance [20], [21], [26], the studies actually assessed very distinct scenarios: the duration and frequency of interventions ranged between one weekly rest day [26] and a one-time two-week LPM closure [27] in different LPM systems. In addition, sample sizes were very variable [21], [26], [27]. Importantly, samples were usually collected from different markets, distinct market areas and from several bird species, but pre- and post-intervention data was not unequivocally matched [19], [20], [21], [23], [26], [27]. Moreover, some investigations assessed AIV-prevalence by virus isolation [19], [20], [21], [23], [27], while others used RT-PCR [26], [27]. Positive RT-PCR results do not discriminate between viable infectious virus and inactivated virus and thus does not have the same biological implications as virus isolation does. Finally, some interventions had different impacts on AIV circulation in different bird species [20], [21]. This suggests distinct AIV-transmission dynamics across species or varying market practises, highlighting the importance to investigate different species separately.",
