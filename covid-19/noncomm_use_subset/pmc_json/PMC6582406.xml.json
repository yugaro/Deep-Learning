EBOV is highly pathogenic, whose infection causes severe Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF), in humans with high mortality rates between 25 and 90% (1\u20133). From 2014 to 2016, West Africa has experienced the largest Ebola outbreak in the history that has resulted in more than 28 000 cases and over 11 000 deaths (4) (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html). Moreover, the most recent Ebola outbreak is still on-going and deteriorating in DR Congo, which has caused 1290 EVD cases and 833 deaths until 16 April 2019 (http://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/en/). Together with another filovirus, Marburg virus (MARV), EBOV has been classified as a Category A priority pathogen, which imposes a significant threat to global public health (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens). Thus far, no approved drug or vaccine is commercially available against EBOV.",

NNSVs share common organizations of viral genomic RNAs and similar strategies of transcription and replication (5). For filoviruses, the (\u2013)-sense viral genomic RNA is approximately 19 kb in length and encodes seven open reading frames (ORFs) for all the viral proteins, i.e. nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, and the large polymerase protein (L) (7\u20139). Upon viral entry into host cells, the released viral genomic (\u2013)-RNAs are used as the templates for the transcription of individual viral mRNAs that are translated into filoviral proteins. The viral genomic (\u2013)-RNAs are then switched to replicate the antigenomic positive-sense (+)-RNAs, which are used as the templates for the production of progeny viral genomic (\u2013)-RNAs (7). The transcription and replication of EBOV RNAs are carried out by the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) L, the polymerase cofactor VP35 (10,11), as well as NP and VP30 (12), which represent the minimal elements required for EBOV transcription and replication (13).",

            "text": "For most RNA viruses including NNSVs, viral genomic, antigenomic and messenger RNAs contain multiple cis-acting elements that play critical roles in viral RNA replication, transcription, translation, and packaging during viral life cycles (14,15). Similar with cellular RNAs, these highly structured RNA elements need to be properly folded to be functional. However, the correct folding of RNA molecules is challenging, since RNAs could be kinetically trapped in misfolded states that are relatively stable in thermodynamics (16,17). To facilitate the correct folding of RNAs, a variety of RNA remodelling proteins, such as RNA helicases and RNA chaperones, are encoded by cells and viruses. These proteins function to destabilize RNA-RNA or RNA\u2013DNA base-pairings to aid RNAs\u2019 proper folding or refolding (18\u201320). In addition, they are believed to participate in the unwinding of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates produced during replication and/or transcription, thereby facilitating the recycling of viral RNA templates for more efficient RNA synthesis. Thus far, a wide range of positive-sense RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses, including picornavirus (21), norovirus (22), flavivirus (23,24), alphavirus (25), coronavirus (26) and reovirus (27), have been found to encode their own RNA helicases and/or RNA chaperones (28,29). However, it is unknown whether NNSVs including filoviruses encode any protein with RNA remodelling activity or the replication/transcription of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral RNA remodelling activity. This apparent discrepancy hampers our understanding of this large group of important pathogenic viruses.",

In addition, VP35 is a modular multifunctional protein that contains dsRNA-binding and oligomerization domains, and plays pivotal roles in filoviral replication and transcription, nucleocapsid assembly, and evasion of host antiviral defenses (7,30\u201334). Here, we show that EBOV VP35 has an unexpected nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity, which can hydrolyze all kinds of ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). Strikingly, EBOV VP35 can function like a helicase to unwind RNA helices from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 in an NTP-dependent manner. Moreover, we have found that guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), a well-known helicase inhibitor (22,34,35) and a U.S. FDA-approved small compound to treat the symptoms of muscle weakness and fatigability associated with Eaton-Lambert syndrome (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=001546) (36,37) can inhibit the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, GuHCl has also been found to exhibit inhibitory effect on the replication/transcription of a stable EBOV minigenome replicon in cultured human cells, highlighting the functional significance of VP35\u2032s NTPase and helicase-like activities in EBOV life cycle, and implying that targeting the helicase-like activity of VP35 can be a novel strategy to develop antivirals against EBOV.",

Our data showed that MBP\u2013VP35 hydrolyzed all four types of NTPs, with a preference on ATP, GTP and UTP over CTP (Figure 1A). Moreover, when increasing concentrations of MBP\u2013VP35 were incubated with ATP, MBP\u2013VP35 can efficiently hydrolyze ATP in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B; Supplementary Figure S3). Furthermore, because VP35 has NTPase activity, it is intriguing to examine if this protein has NTP-binding activity. Our data show that 5\u2032-ATP agarose can readily pull-down MBP\u2013VP35 but not MBP alone (Figure 1C), showing that VP35 does bind to ATP. Of note, MBP protein was expressed and purified exactly same as MBP\u2013VP35, and showed negligible NTP hydrolysis and binding.",

The helix-unwinding assay was performed by incubating the RNA helix substrate with MBP\u2013VP35 in a standard unwinding reaction mixture, followed by the separation of the substrate strands via gel electrophoresis. Our data showed that the HEX-labeled RNA strand was efficiently released from the RNA helix substrate in the presence of MBP\u2013VP35 (Figure 2B, lane 4), whereas the same helix substrate was not separated when the negative control (MBP alone) was present (Figure 2B, lane 3). Of note, the unwinding reactions were performed in the reaction mixture containing ATP and MgCl2; and the boiled helix substrate or the addition of MBP-fusion EV71 2C, a well-characterized viral RNA helicase, was used as positive control for helix unwinding.

The three helix substrates were then subjected to the RNA helix-unwinding assay by being reacted with purified MBP\u2013VP35. Our results showed that MBP\u2013VP35 efficiently unwound 5\u2032-tailed RNA helix, but barely unwound 3\u2032-tailed one (Figure 3D). Moreover, it could not unwind the blunt-ended RNA helix (Figure 3E), like other viral helicases such as EV71 2C (34). To further determine the unwinding directionality of VP35, we evaluated its helix-unwinding activity in each direction in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. Our data showed that the increasing concentrations of ATP failed to promote the unwinding of 3\u2032-tailed helix substrate (Figure 3F), but efficiently promoted the unwinding of 5\u2032-tailed helix substrate in a dose-responsive manner (Figure 3G and 3H).

We observed that the RNA helix-unwinding activity of MBP\u2013VP35 required the presence of Mg2+ (Figure 4B, lane 4), while the presence of Mn2+ could also support the helix-unwinding by VP35 in a much lesser extent (Figure 4B, lane 5). On the other hand, although Ca2+ and Zn2+ have been found to support the NTPase activity of VP35 (Figure 1D), these two ions could not support the helix-unwinding activity of VP35 (Figure 4B, lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, increasing concentrations of Mg2+ could promote the helix-unwinding activity of VP35 in a dose-responsive manner (Figure 4C). Besides, the optimal helix-unwinding activity of MBP\u2013VP35 was determined to be at pH values of 7\u20138 (Figure 4D, lanes 5 and 6), consistent with the optimal pH for the NTPase activity of VP35 (Figure 1F).",

Each of the four different helix substrates was incubated with MBP\u2013VP35 and subjected to the standard helix-unwinding assay. Our results showed that VP35 could unwind RNA helix R*/R (Figure 5A) and RNA\u2013DNA hybrid D/R* (Figure 5C), both of which have longer RNA strands. On the other hand, VP35 could not unwind DNA helix D*/D (Figure 5B) or RNA\u2013DNA hybrid R*/D (Figure 5D) that have longer DNA strand.

To this end, we utilized a stable EBOV minigenome replicon system (EBOV replicon cells) that can stably replicate and transcribe the EBOV minigenomic RNA [the Gaussia luciferase (GLuc)-encoding ORF was flanked by the minimal cis-elements located at the two ends of EBOV genome] in Huh7 cells stably expressing NP, VP35, VP30, and L (41). The EBOV replicon cells were treated with GuHCl at the indicated concentrations for 96 h. After that, we examined the cell viability at the doses we applied, and found no obvious cytotoxicity until the concentration of GuHCl up to 2 mM (Figure 8D). And 1 mM GuHCl did not affect the expression levels of NP, VP30, VP35 and \u03b2-actin (Supplementary Figure S11A). Then, the replication and transcription of the EBOV minigenome replicon were examined by measuring the levels of GLuc activity, minigenomic viral RNA (vRNA), cRNA (complementary to vRNA; replication intermediate), and viral mRNA. Our data show that both the replication and transcription of the EBOV minigenome were inhibited by GuHCl treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8E and F).",

Besides, when comparing with transiently transfected minigenome system, this stable EBOV minigenome replicon has been reported to show high level of active minigenome replication, and be relatively stable and even insensitive to IFN treatment or RNA interference, probably due to the persistent replication and the strong viral RNP stability of this minigenome (41). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of GuHCl on the replication and transcription of EBOV minigenome is quite remarkable.

And it is intriguing to ask how the NTPase/helicase-like activity of VP35 functions in the life cycle of EBOV. VP35 is a cofactor of polymerase L and an essential component of filoviral RNP complex, which carries out the EBOV RNA replication and transcription. Thus, it is plausible that VP35 can work together with NP and L to mediate the unwinding of dsRNA intermediates produced during viral RNA replication/transcription, and/or can aid the rearrangement of the cis-acting elements within EBOV mRNA and genomic/antigenomic RNAs, thereby facilitating the transcription, translation and encapsidation of EBOV RNAs or allowing viral RNAs to switch among distinct processes. However, owing to technical limitations, virus-encoded RNA remodeling activities are usually studied in vitro, and it is mostly infeasible to measure the exact roles of RNA helicases on the structures and functionalities of viral RNAs in infected cells (56). Indeed, GuHCl, an FDA-approved small compound and well-known inhibitor of certain viral helicases, including enterovirus 2C and norovirus NS3, is able to inhibit the NTPase/helicase-like activity of EBOV VP35 as well as EBOV minigenome replication/transcription in cells, implying the functional importance of the VP35-associated RNA remodeling activity in EBOV replication. Future advances in techniques may overcome the technical barriers and provide mechanistic and dynamic views of how VP35 remodels viral RNA molecules at different processes of EBOV life cycle.",

            "text": "According to the conventional view, helicases contain NTPase activity, utilize the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to melt nucleic acid base-pairings, and are thought to participate in most ATP-dependent rearrangements of structured RNAs. Helicases are generally classified into six superfamilies (SFs), designated SF1 to SF6, on the basis of conserved helicase motifs. Interestingly, although EBOV VP35 does not contain any conventional helicase motifs (57,58), the NTPase/helicase-like activities of VP35 have most basic biochemical characteristics of canonical RNA helicases, including the NTP-dependency, the requirement of divalent metallic ion, and the directionality of helix unwinding, leading to the question whether the canonical conserved motifs are not necessary for a protein to possess the NTPase and RNA remodeling activities. Factually, Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoV) 2C protein contains the conserved motif A, which is commonly recognized as the core NTP binding and NTPase active site of SF3 helicases (21), but the NTPase activity of EoV 2C is not dependent on this motif. In addition, the capsid protein VP5 of Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus-5 (HaCPV-5; genus Cypovirus, family Reoviridae) has the NTPase activity, which is also Mg2+-dependent and can hydrolyze all kinds of NTPs and dNTPs, but contains no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs (27,47). Thus, our current study, together with the previous studies, imply that some of the NTPase and RNA remodeling activities may not strictly rely on conserved motifs in linear sequences of amino acids, but probably determined by more sophisticated active sites formed in tertiary protein structures. In the current study, we have determined that the middle aa. 137\u2013173 region of EBOV VP35 is critical for its NTPase activity. This middle region does not belong to the N-terminal oligomerization domain and the C-terminal IID, both of whose structures have been resolved (45,50). Interestingly, although the structure of the VP35 middle region has not been determined yet, the sequence alignment of VP35 proteins from multiple filoviruses, including Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV), MARV, and Lloviu virus (LLOV) shows that this region is highly conserved within Filoviridae (Supplementary Figure S7A). And our predicted secondary structure from PSI-blast based secondary structure prediction (PSIPRED) revealed that this region contains a \u03b2-strand and an \u03b1-helix (Supplementary Figure S7B) (59,60). Besides, the motif scan by using the PROSITE profiles via the MyHits (https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan) suggested that the amino acid T149 of EBOV VP35 is a possible protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site (61). These analyses highlight the importance of this region in the structure and function of filoviral VP35s. Future studies should reveal whether the \u03b2-strand and \u03b1-helix as well as the putative PKC phosphorylation site are critical for the NTPase/helicase-like activity of VP35.",

Indeed, numerous, if not all, DNA viruses and positive-sense RNA viruses have been found to encode their own helicases, which share the conserved NTPase/helicase signature motifs with various host helicases of diverse organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (62,63). Based on the conserved motifs, putative helicases can be predicted by bioinformatic algorithms before being biochemically confirmed and characterized. And the lack of conserved helicase signature motifs within EBOV VP35 should be the reason why the NTPase/helicase-like activities were not predicted and identified previously. Moreover, the high conservation of helicase signature motifs suggests that various viral and host helicases share similar origins. On the other hand, the NTPase/helicase-like activities of EBOV VP35 should be evolved independently, suggesting that filoviruses (and probably other NNSVs) have an earlier evolutionary divergence with positive-sense RNA viruses before the latter \u2018acquire\u2019 canonical helicases. More importantly, in the absence of a canonical helicase, EBOV manages to obtain a helicase-like activity instead, highlighting its functional necessity to EBOV. Given that all the members of Filoviridae encode VP35 proteins, which are functionally analogous to the P proteins of other NNSVs (5), future studies by us and others should investigate whether the NTPase/helicase activities are general to other filoviral VP35 as well as NNSV P proteins.",

Guanidines are ubiquitously present in nature, and can function as mediators of specific non-covalent binding in various catalytic processes (64,67).

These findings uncover an unexpected novel function of EBOV VP35, extend the view of RNA remodelling proteins, provide the evidence that guanidine-containing compounds may serve as potential candidates for anti-EBOV/filovirus drug development by targeting VP35, and shed light on the understanding of EBOV and filovirus replication and pathogenesis.",
