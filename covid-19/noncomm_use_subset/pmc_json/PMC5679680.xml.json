A study about the\noccurrence of public health emergencies in Brazil proved that, in the border areas,\nlaboratory confirmation remains low for suspected cases\n21\n. This lack of diagnosis can be attributed to the high testing demand that these\nlaboratories have, which requires additional investment for its expansion and an\nincrease of capacity to become a robust border network. Although one of the response\npillars to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been the laboratory support, the lack\nof capacity during the early stages of the epidemic was undoubtedly a factor that\ncontributed to Ebola\u2019s rapid expansion, reinforcing the idea of consolidating a prepared\nnetwork to respond to any type of threat\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n. Such difficulties in the BES development, including laboratory services, may\nhave contributed to a weak capacity to detect and respond in a timely manner to public\nhealth events, as observed for the Brazilian international border municipalities\n34\n. The analysis of their capacity to report infectious diseases with a potential\nto generate an epidemic demonstrated a very low proportion (16,6%) of cases of these\ndiseases being reported in a timely manner (< 24 hours - as established\nnationally).",

Hence, the Brazilian Southern Border Arc has an extremely high daily porosity\nfor people entry and exit, once the crossing between countries can be taken without any\nimpediment. As evidenced by the research, there are numerous points of entry, where\nthere are no checkpoints, such as health inspection points or customs. On the other\nhand, in North America, in addition to the physical barriers along the border, all entry\npoints are controlled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This agency first\nscreens incoming international travelers with the CDC and has the power to detain for\nthe enforcement of isolation and quarantine of individuals with any signs and/or\nsymptoms of infectious diseases\n36\n. The presence of such agencies as the CBP plays an important role in the\ncontainment of infectious diseases entering the United States.

Inside this network, an\nimportant movement should be made to bring international organizations closer, such as\nPAHO and multilateral mechanisms, as MERCOSUR and UNASUR.
