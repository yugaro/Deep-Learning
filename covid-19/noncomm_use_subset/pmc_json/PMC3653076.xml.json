According to statistics report over the 1990's (1991-2000), natural disasters/MCIs such as storms and floods have caused an annual average of 122 people dead or missing, 17,219 refugees and property losses of over 580 billion won (KRW) (20). In the same period technical disasters/MCIs such as train derailments, plane crashes, bridge collapses, fires aboard liners, city gas explosions and building collapses cause tens to hundreds of victims. In the 2000s, MCIs such as the Daegu subway fire and the 2007 MT Hebei Spirit oil spill raised issues of the physical health of local residents and volunteers (21).",

Disaster management system of Korea consists of the central safety management committee, headed by the prime minister and subcommittees headed by the ministers of various government ministries. The central safety management committee supervises and coordinates overall policy related to disaster and safety, and also promotes negotiations and coordination among the relevant ministries. The subcommittees help ensure the seamless operation of the central committee, especially, the coordination committee under the Minister of Public Administration and Security, is in charge of the overall process of negotiations and coordination with regard to tasks delegated by the central committee. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) provides emergency medical service (EMS) to Korea and plays a key role in the response to disasters and MCIs in most communities. A single-tiered fire-based EMS handles disasters and MCIs occurring throughout the entire Korean region and includes 16 regional headquarters of the fire department with a total of 1,400 advanced ambulances and 5,400 EMS providers. In addition, headed by the administrator of the NEMA, operates the central emergency rescue control team to supervise and control matters related to emergency rescue, command, and control at the disaster site.",

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States (US) has defined an MCI as a case in which more than 6 casualties have occurred (23). Thirty papers were reviewed by searching MEDLINE and the Cochrane library prior to conducting expert interviews to create a definition for both disasters and MCIs that would fit the situation of Korea. A number of the aforementioned survey papers and classroom presentations on various definitions of disasters and MCIs were introduced in further expert interviews with instructors who had finished the National Disaster Life Support (NDLS) course, a disaster emergency medical expert training program. The classic Delphi method was used to conduct the first survey via e-mail with experts who are instructors of the NDLS course, and the policy Delphi survey (24) was undertaken as a secondary survey after presenting the results of the first survey to interview subjects so that they could collect ideas and suggestions.",

These reports were made available for this study through the cooperation of NEMA. Using the Daily Accidental Management Situation Reports, all NEMA disaster reports from the 16 Korean provinces were coded and entered into an electronic database.
