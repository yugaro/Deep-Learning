New variant IBV strains in chickens continually emerge worldwide owing\nto the high mutation rate of its genome [4]. Various\nvaccines have been developed but the disease still occurs, because different serotypes of the\nvirus do not cross-protect and vaccine failures are often associated with the emergence of\nantigenic variants that differ from the vaccine viruses [9, 14].",

Briefly, 100\n\u00b5l of virus (containing 100 50% viral embryo infectious doses) was\nincubated with 100 \u00b5l of antiserum (containing 20 units) at room temperature\nfor 1 hr. The infectivity of the virus-antiserum mixture was assayed in 10 9-to-11-day-old SPF\nchicken embryos. After 1 week, embryos were evaluated for IBV infection by observing for\ndeath, dwarfing and urate deposition as described for virus titration. In the control groups,\nantisera were replaced with PBS. A virus was considered to match the serotype of the\nantiserum, if the antiserum protected five or more of the embryos. The results showed that the\ntwo new IBV isolates similar to Japan, S78 and TC3, were not neutralized completely with the\nreference antisera. The protection rates for S78 by anti-TW-I, anti-TW-II and anti-Mass were\n0/10 (numbers protected/ numbers tested), 0/10 and 0/10, respectively. Those for TC3 were\n1/10, 4/10 and 0/10, respectively. The results indicated that both viruses could not be\nneutralized by reference antisera, since their protection rates were less than 50%.",

            "text": "Despite extensive vaccination, IB has occurred occasionally, especially in cold seasons. Most\nIBVs present in Taiwan are TW-I or TW-II. Surprisingly, in the present study, TW-II was more\npredominant than TW-I, contrary to previous reports [5,\n7,8,9]. Furthermore, a challenging aspect of this investigation\nwas the emergence of new types, such as the IBVs similar to strains isolated in Japan, which\nwere found to be widespread in Taiwan since they were identified in different locations and\ndifferent chicken breeds. A previous study revealed that five genotypes existed in Japan in\n2010, JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, 4/91 and Mass [1]. In the\npresent study, the IBVs that were similar to Japanese strains showed the highest similarity to\nJP-I. However, the origin of these isolates is unknown and needs further investigation. The\ncurrent vaccine strains might not protect against these new isolates, since the one-direction\nneutralization tests showed less than 50% protection in chicken embryos.",
