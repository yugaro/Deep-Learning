The replication-defective (E1-deleted) and replication-competent (E3-deleted) hAd5 have both been used as vaccine delivery vectors. For biosafety concerns, a replication-defective hAd5 is considered to be more suitable for vaccination. Replication-defective vectors may also have deletion in the E3 region to increase the amount of foreign DNA that can be inserted. Conventional strategy for the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vector includes insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. This antigen is expressed as transgene after the infection of permissive cells with recombinant adenovirus.",

To overcome such hurdles, the \u201cantigen capsid-incorporation\u201d strategy was developed [4]. Incorporating an immunogenic peptide into the hAd5 capsid offers several potential advantages. Importantly, the processing of capsid-incorporated antigen via the exogenous pathway could result in a strong humoral response, similar to that generated by native hAd5 capsid proteins, and this strategy may also be useful in boosting antigen-specific antibody immune responses.",

These HVRs do not appear to be involved in the binding of any other viral proteins, and the loops at the top of the HVRs are the most amenable to modifications. It was also shown that short heterologous peptides can be incorporated within the HVRs of hexon without affecting the viability of the virus [10, 11]. Incorporating antigens into hexon is applicable towards vaccination for several pathogens including the poliovirus, pseudomonas, B. anthracis, influenza, malaria and HIV [12-17].

Homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells led to generation of the recombinant virus, termed Ad5HVR7epB. Multiple attempts to rescue the other two recombinant viruses (Ad5HVR8epB and Ad5HVR9epB) were not successful. This inability to rescue recombinant viruses with the foreign peptide insertion into HVR8 and HVR9 of hexon suggested that the insertion interferes with the formation of viral particles.",

To insert the DNA sequence encoding the main neutralizing epitope B of PRRSV in HVR7 and obtain the DNA fragment for cloning, four consequent PCRs were performed using Phusion high-fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). First, a 1 kb fragment was amplified using primers BL7F1 and Nhe-R, and pUC-Ad5-hex as a template. Second, a 1 kb fragment was amplified using primers BLF2 and Nhe-R, and the product of PCR 1 as a template.

The final 1.7 kb PCR product was digested with NdeI and NheI and cloned into NdeI and NheI sites of pUC-Ad5-hex, creating pUC-Ad5hex-HVR7epB.
