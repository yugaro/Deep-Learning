However, the role of the rs12252-C allele in acute HIV-1 infection has not been explored. Jia et al.[10] showed that IFITM3 inhibits viruses that enter the cells via different routes. The presence of IFITM3 on late endosome blocks cytosolic access of pH-dependent viruses, such as influenza A. However, for pH-independent viruses such as HIV-1, IFITM3 appears to restrict viral cell entry at the cell periphery or early endosome. Furthermore, IFITM3 inhibits HIV-1 replication in vitro by reducing the expression of HIV-1 proteins such as Gag, Vif and Nef [11]. This raises the question: does the minor allele (of Caucasians) have the same effect on acute HIV-1 infection as it does on influenza virus? This is especially pertinent to the growing concern about the spread of HIV in China, in particular, among MSM. To address this question, we screened 6000 individuals from the HIV primary open cohort (PRIMO) from Beijing, China, and compared the clinical outcome in rs12252-CC/CT and TT-genotyped carriers.",

Those who did not show a significant CD4+ T-cell decline were defined as nonprogressors [13]. Initial and peak viremia levels were defined according to the dynamics of HIV-1 viremia in acute HIV-1-infected patients [14]: initial viral load indicates HIV-1 viral load detected at Fiebig stage II\u2013III [14], and peak viremia level refers to the highest viral load detected during the acute HIV-1 infection.

It has been predicted that this mutation may result in expression of truncated IFITM3, which lacks the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus [8]. Previous mechanistic studies have all been based on this assumption, and the conclusions have been rather controversial [8,16]). However, the existence of a truncated IFITM3 protein in cells with the SNP rs12252-C allele has not yet been shown. In cells that were transfected with a synthetic truncated version lacking the first 21 amino acids, IFITM3 was relocated from the late endosome to the cell periphery [10]. If IFITM3 is relocated to the cell surface, it might affect HIV-1 viral entry [10]. Moreover, Tartour et al.[17] have suggested that IFITM proteins are incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles and impair their infectivity. These findings could partly explain our results.",
