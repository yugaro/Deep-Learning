The green fluorescence signals revealed that CSBF-EGFP also had a cytoplasmic localization. There was no signal presented on cell membrane or in the nucleus. The DsRed-tagged organelle markers (DsRed-ER and DsRed-Golgi) were used to precisely determine the localization of CSBF-myc-His.

Previous studies deduced high-confidence interactions between CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2, as well as Gal1 and SUSD243. SUSD2 encodes an 822-amino acid type I membrane protein containing extracellular domains of SO, AMOP, VWD, and CCP (Supplementary Figure S2a)44. In order to determine whether these four domains are indispensable for the location and function of SUSD2, we constructed truncated mutants of these four extracellular domains and checked the expression of these constructs (Supplementary Figure S2b). Then we examined subcellular localization of these mutants in LoVo cells. Supplementary Figure S2c showed different expression patterns of full length SUSD2 and all these mutants. Compared with the wild type of SUSD2, all these mutants are abundant in cytoplasm, suggesting that absence of any of these four domains would change the localization of this protein, which may further affect its function. So the following studies only included the function of intact SUSD2 protein.",

Then we found out that CSBF/C10orf99 induced internalization of SUSD2-EGFP in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2b Up). To precisely determine the internalization of SUSD2-EGFP, the endosome marker (DsRed-Rab5) was used. As illustrated in Figure 2b Down, the internalized SUSD2-EGFP was located in the endosome.

To determine whether CSBF/C10orf99 was down-regulated on the protein level, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CSBF/C10orf99 with GST-CSBF fusion protein as immunogen and purified by CSBF/C10orf99 affinity chromatography.

            "text": "Sugahara and colleagues have demonstrated that the ectopic expression of Susd2, the mouse homolog of SUSD2, can inhibit growth and reverse tumorigenic phenotypes of HT1080 cells and HeLa cells in vitro5556. Their results indicated that Susd2 is a possible tumor suppressor, which is similar as our results. Watson et al. reported that SUSD2 interacts with Gal1 and the cell surface localization of Gal1 is dependent on the existence of SUSD244. The interaction of SUSD2 with Gal1 increased the invasion of breast cancer cells and might play a significant role in modulating the body's immune response. GEO profile analysis showed that SUSD2 was significantly down-regulated in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha-silenced breast cancer cells (GDS4061), and it was up-regulated in ER positive cells (GDS4067) and some ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (GDS3592). Meanwhile, Gal1 is the reported ligand of SUSD2 and involved in tumor transformation, angiogenesis, cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis57. Our results showed that the affinity between CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 is similar to that of Gal-1 and SUSD2, but the functions are different. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression and function of SUSD2 might be influenced by estrogen, ligands and microenvironment.",
