All electrolyte levels were also within normal range. Serum\namyloid A (SAA) was high at 17.3 mg/l (reference range, 0\u20135\nmg/l) and no abnormalities were found in the coagulation test and thyroid\nfunction test. Feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies (IDEXX\nLaboratories, Markham, Ontario), and feline parvo virus kit (BioNote Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Korea)\nwere negative. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging did not yield any specific findings\nrelated to the clinical symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology tests were normal, and\ninfectious agents (Bartonella spp., Cryptococcus spp., feline Coronavirus, Toxoplasma\ngondii) were excluded using IDEXX Feline Neurologic RealPCR Panel. Through the\nprocess of these clinical examinations and laboratory tests, the patient was diagnosed with\nidiopathic epilepsy. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg; Samjin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was\ninfused intravenously as an emergency medicine, and phenobarbital (Hana Pharm. Co., Ltd.,\nSeoul, Korea) was loaded with 15 mg/kg (divided into three times) intravenous injection.\nEpileptic seizures were stopped and phenobarbital was prescribed 2.5 mg/kg two times daily per\noral for 2 weeks.",

Twenty three days\nafter discharge (7 days after last visit), the body temperature was measured at 38.5\u00b0C, and\nSAA was \u22645 mg/l. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that the size of the lymph\nnodes had decreased and the splenic honeycomb-like nodules had disappeared.

One limitation was that we were not able to carry out\nthe definitive exclusion of lymphoma via PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement, flow\ncytometry, or biopsy-based histopathologic examination [2, 9]. The FNA test, however, has a high\ndiagnostic accuracy (90% for dogs, and 70% for cats) in the diagnosis of lymphoma [10]. Another limitation was that we did not rule out\npancreatitis through evaluating serum concentration of amylase and lipase, and pancreatic\nlipase immunoreactivity. However, lethargy and fever improved as the serum concentration of\nphenobarbital decreased. In addition, we did not find any obvious change in pancreas by\nultrasonography. We report here a case of phenobarbital-induced AHS which has been rarely\nreported in veterinary medicine, and this report could serve as a valuable reference for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of feline AHS using serum SAA and anticonvulsant concentrations.",
