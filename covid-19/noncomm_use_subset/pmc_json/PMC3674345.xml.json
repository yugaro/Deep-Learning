Based on the amino-acid sequence alignment (Figure 1a), mouse (Mus musculus) G6PD shows the highest homology (93%) compared with human (Homo sapiens) G6PD, followed by zebrafish (Danio rerio, 74%), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster, 61%), nematode (C. elegans, 56%), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 45%), and bacteria (Escherichia coli, 34%). Similar to eukaryotic G6PD homologues, including fruit fly, zebrafish, and mouse, C. elegans G6PD contains a shorter amino terminus compared with human counterpart (Figure 1a). In addition, C. elegans G6PD is separated from multicellular eukaryotic and microbial G6PD homologues in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1b). Although microbial G6PD homologues display lower degree of conservation compared with human counterpart, it has been shown that the bacterial form of G6PD exerts antioxidant activity in G6PD-nullizygous mouse embryonic stem cells.23 Based on the high degree of conservation between C. elegans and human, it is speculated that C. elegans G6PD is a functional homologue of human G6PD.",

By measuring G6PD status, including mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity in G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans, the knockdown efficiency was determined (Figure 2). As expected, a marked reduction of g6pd mRNA level was detected in Gi C.elegans (22% of mock, P<0.005, N=4) (Figure 2a). In addition, western blot analysis using anti-human G6PD polyclonal antibody showed diminished G6PD protein level in Gi C.elegans compared with mock (Figure 2b, inlet). Consistent with the downregulated G6PD protein expression, a significant decrease of G6PD catalytic activity was detected in Gi C.elegans (11% of mock, P<0.005, N=8) (Figure 2b). The residual G6PD activity (11%) in Gi C. elegans was in good accord with our recent report in G6PD-knockdown human cell line.13 Despite significant depletion of G6PD, no vital growth defects were observed in the first generation of Gi C. elegans compared to mock C. elegans under our experimental condition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that G6PD knockdown in C. elegans is reproducible in the generation of a viable G6PD-deficient animal model.",

By incubating first-day C. elegans adult with ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye 2\u2032, 7\u2032 dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFDA), increased ROS was detected in Gi C. elegans compared with mock C. elegans (1.2-fold, P=0.038, N=6) (Figure 3a). To further investigate whether G6PD deficiency caused oxidative damage in macromolecues, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. While there was no significant difference of MDA level between mock and Gi C. elegans (data not shown), 8-OHdG level was significantly increased in Gi C. elegans compared to mock (1.5-fold, P=0.005, N=6) (Figure 3b).

The lack of major phenotypes upon G6PD knockdown indicated that the residual G6PD activity in Gi C. elegans is sufficient to maintain basic cell functions in C. elegans (Figure 2b). Nevertheless, the brood size derived from the first generation of Gi hermaphrodite was significantly reduced (65% of mock, P=0.011, n=60) compared with mock control (Figure 4a). This finding indicates that G6PD is required for maintaining normal egg production. In addition to the decreased egg production upon G6PD knockdown, a majority of eggs produced by Gi C. elegans were unable to hatch compared with mock (10% of mock, P<0.005, n=60) (Figure 4b). This dramatic observation is consistent with a previous report that G6PD knockdown induces embryonic lethality in C. elegans.24",

Since DCFDA mainly stains for H2O2, the possibility that other ROS species contribute to elevated DNA oxidative damage in G6PD-deficient C. elegans cannot be excluded. In the current study, short-term H2O2 enhances germ cell apoptosis in mock C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5a). However, the fact that H2O2 cannot further enhance germ cell apoptosis in G6PD-deficient C. elegans suggests that it may be due to the buildup of endogenous oxidative stress in the oocytes that enhances germ cell apoptosis. Consequently, the enhanced germ cell death may lead to reduced egg production in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans as possible mechanism illustrated in Figure 8a. Nevertheless, the fact that vitamin E feeding fails to rescue the defective egg production and hatching in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans under our experimental condition (data not shown), suggesting the modulation of the redox homeostasis is a very complicated matter and these findings are consistent with previous report that antioxidant supplementation often displays mixed or negative outcomes in clinical trials.34 Hence, the effect of increased oxidative stress or oxidative damage may be limited in playing a role in enhanced germ cell apoptosis caused by G6PD deficiency.",

            "text": "As p53-dependent DNA damage pathway35 and G6PD knockdown-induced alteration in MAPK activity are associated with cell demise,13 loss-of-function mutants of C. elegans p53 (cep-1) and MAPK pathways (pmk-1, sek-1 and mek-1) are scored for their egg production (Figure 6) and hatching (Figure 7) upon G6PD knockdown. The interpretation of the genetic analysis suggests that cep-1 is not required for the maintenance of normal egg production (Figure 6a). On the other hand, the p38 MAPK pathway, including pmk-1 and sek-1, is required for the maintenance of normal egg production (Figures 6b and c). As G6PD knockdown cannot further decrease egg production in pmk-1 mutant, this indicates that pmk-1 may act downstream of g6pd in the same pathway for maintaining normal egg production (Figure 6b). While mek-1 is not involved in the maintenance of normal egg production (Figure 6d), the additive suppression of egg production in sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant suggests that sek-1 may function in parallel to g6pd rather than in the same pathway (Figure 6c). In general, p38 MAPK pathway is associated with diverse cellular functions, including immunity, apoptosis, stress response, and cell fate determination. The C. elegans pmk-1, a human p38 MAPK homologue, is activated by the mammalian MKK3/6 homologue sek-1, a member of MAPKK, which is downstream of nsy-1. The nsy-1-sek-1-pmk-1 cascade of p38 MAPK signaling is essential in the environmental response in C. elegans.36 In addition, the C. elegans mek-1, a member of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), is also involved in stress response.37 Hence, our results indicate that MAPK pathway is not directly associated with G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production in C. elegans.",

            "text": "Despite MAPK pathway being not directly associated with egg production upon G6PD knockdown (Figures 6b\u2013d), loss of function of sek-1 or mek-1 exhibits a substantial increase of hatching in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans embryos (8.3-fold and 9.6-fold, respectively) (Figure 7). Since G6PD is a major NADPH producing enzyme in cells, we hypothesized that there is a yet identified molecular sensor that respond to NADPH status in C. elegans. Upon G6PD knockdown, such NADPH sensor modulates the downstream signaling required for normal hatching. Such notion is not unprecedented. The translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2p45-related transcription factor), is modulated by a NADPH-requiring enzyme, NADPH oxidase (NOX).38 This exemplifies a positive regulation of signal transduction affected by NADPH. On the other hand, a recently identified NADPH sensor, HSCARG (NmrA (34\u201336)-like family domain containing protein 1), is shown to negatively regulate NF-\u03baB function.39, 40 Furthermore, the dual oxidase-derived oxidative burst is essential for extracellular matrix modification of sea urchin eggs during fertilization.41, 42, 43 Still more, it has been reported that ROS can negatively regulate Ras/MAPK pathway.44 In addition, p38 and ERK/MAPK have been shown to block bovine preimplantation embryogenesis.45 In order to clarify the role of MAPK in G6PD knockdown-induced defective hatching, we proposed a mechanism (Figure 8b) in which the depletion of G6PD-derived NADPH reduces the activity of the unknown NADPH sensor (for example, dual oxidase46) in C. elegans. The decreased ROS signaling (represents as low oxidative stress, in contrast to high oxidative stress that causes defective egg production in G6PD deficiency) activates MAPK activity through negative regulation. In turn, the activated MAPK impairs the hatching possibly through multiple signal transduction pathways. Hence, the inactivation of mek-1 or sek-1 negates the deleterious effects on hatching caused by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. Indeed, the role of MAPK signaling in antagonizing essential gene for embryogenesis has been documented. The loss-of-function of MAPK pathways, including lin-45 (RAF), mek-2 (MEK), and mpk-1 (ERK), differentially rescue embryonic lethality of par-1 (partitioning defective) mutant embryos.47 However, how does the inactivation of sek-1 or mek-1 actually suppress the defective hatching induced by G6PD knockdown remains to be elucidated.",

However, G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displays enhanced germ cell apoptosis and reduced egg production as well as a severe defect in hatching. Mechanistic studies suggest that decreased egg production in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans could be attributed in part to increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage. In contrast to its toxic effect in egg production, ROS may play an important role as signal molecules to mediate MAPK pathway that in turn can affect hatching in C. elegans.",

The supernatant was incubated with 0.7 mg/ml RNase A, 0.46% SDS, and 0.1 mM deferoxamine mesylate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. It was followed by the addition of 0.36 mg/ml of proteinase K for 16\u201318 h in dark at room temperature on a rotating roller drum. The DNA was extracted by phenol/ chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25 : 24 : 1) and precipitated with 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). The DNA pellet was sequentially washed by 99.5 and 70% ethanol. The washed DNA was resuspended in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and digested to nucleotide level for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with 20 units of nuclease P1. Subsequently, 6 units of alkaline phosphatase in 1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.5) were added for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C.

G6PD deficiency reduces NADPH level, which may modulate signaling pathways of egg production and hatching. (a) The mechanism of G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production is proposed. NADPH depletion impairs redox homeostasis as indicated by increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. As a result, the accumulated oxidative insult enhances germ cell death and leads to decreased egg production. (b) The mechanism of G6PD knockdown-induced defective hatching is proposed. Upon G6PD knockdown, the diminished NADPH reduces the activity of a yet to be identified sensor, for example dual oxidase. The decreased production of sensor-derived ROS, which serves as signaling molecules, activates mek-1 or sek-1 through negative regulation. In turn, activation of mek-1 or sek-1 impairs normal hatching possibly through multiple signaling pathways. Hence, the loss of function of mek-1 or sek-1 negates the deleterious effects on hatching due to G6PD deficiency in C. elegans",
