            "text": "Fibrillarin is a 33\u201336 kDa nucleolar protein involved in multiple aspects of RNA biogenesis. It is a major protein in the fibrillar regions of the nucleolus where rRNA transcription and early pre-rRNA processing take place (1,2). Fibrillarin is also found in Cajal bodies (CBs), subnuclear dynamic particles that contain distinct components involved in RNA transcription and editing such as mRNA splicing and small nuclear/nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (sn/snoRNP) biogenesis (3,4). Fibrillarin is a core component of box C/D snoRNP particles, which are responsible for site-specific 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNA and for pre-rRNA cleavage, and box C/D-containing small CB-specific RNPs (scaRNPs) that methylate snRNAs (5,6). Assembled sn/snoRNPs traffic through CBs before accumulating in both splicing speckles (sites of storage/assembly of splicing factors/complexes) and also in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus where early pre-rRNA processing events take place. In all cases, fibrillarin is found in multi-component complexes containing RNA (snoRNA, pre-rRNA) and proteins. In eukaryotes, the mature box C/D snoRNP complex competent for snRNA/pre-rRNA modification contains the RNA-binding 15.5-kDa protein and the two related proteins Nop56 and Nop58 in addition to fibrillarin and the snoRNA (5).",

            "text": "Fibrillarin is highly evolutionarily conserved with respect to sequence, structure and function (5,7\u201310). On the basis of the amino acid sequence alignment of fibrillarin proteins from different species, Aris and Blobel (7) suggested that fibrillarin contains several domains. Within the human fibrillarin protein (36 kDa\u2014320 amino acids), three structure/functions regions have been predicted (7; Figure 1). The N-terminal region of fibrillarin is represented by a glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain that is also found in fibrillarin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Xenopus laevis and Tetrahymena thermophila (7,9,11), but not in archaeal fibrillarin proteins (5,8). The GAR domain is methylated at arginine residues (12), possibly by the arginine methyltransferases found in complex with fibrillarin (13). The GAR domain is responsible for the interactions with various cellular (14,15) and viral proteins (16,17). The data concerning the role of the GAR domain in nucleolar localization are contradictory. Some findings demonstrate that the GAR domain is not required to target fibrillarin to the nucleolus or CBs, although it contains a nucleolar localization signal (3), but other results suggest that the GAR domain provides the nucleolar targeting of fibrillarin in plants and human cells (9,18).\n",

            "text": "In addition to the major functions in biogenesis of different RNAs and ribosomal subunits, the growing body of evidence demonstrates that fibrillarin is involved in infection by a range of different viruses. The nucleocapsid proteins of porcine arterivirus and avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) interact with nucleolin and fibrillarin (23,17), and as a result the normal functions of these nucleolar proteins may be diverted for the benefit of the viruses. The infection of cells with IBV has been shown to disrupt nucleolar architecture (24) and cause arrest of the cell cycle in G2 and failure of cytokinesis (23,25,26). Plant viruses are also able to recruit fibrillarin to facilitate different stages of infection including virus movement, assembly of virus-specific RNP particles and possibly to combat host defence responses (see for review, 27). It has been shown that the ability of the plant groundnut rosette virus (GRV, the genus Umbravirus) to move long distances through the phloem, the specialized plant vascular system, strictly depends on the interaction of its movement protein (the ORF3 protein) with fibrillarin. This interaction is essential for nucleolar import of the ORF3 protein via CBs, re-localization of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm, and assembly of cytoplasmic umbraviral RNP particles capable of long-distance spread and systemic infection (16,28,29). It has also been demonstrated that fibrillarin interacts with the multifunctional protein VPg of potato virus A (the genus Potyvirus) (30) and the 2b silencing suppressor protein of cucumber mosaic virus (the genus Cucumovirus) (31). These data indicate that interaction with fibrillarin may be a general property of various virus proteins from different taxonomic groups.",

            "text": "Thus, fibrillarin plays an important role in various processes in normal cells and during virus infections. In most cases, it functions as a part of different cellular and viral RNP complexes. Analysis of RNPs, immunoprecipitated with anti-fibrillarin antibodies, has shown fibrillarin to be associated with complexes containing all known box C/D snoRNAs in yeast and a plethora of snoRNAs in other organisms (32\u201340). Structural investigations of human fibrillarin (10) and the archaeal rRNA-modifying complex (8) did not determine whether and how fibrillarin directly interacted with RNA moieties. Indeed, it is generally accepted that the specificity of targeting of these complexes to the sites of modification of rRNA may not be determined by fibrillarin but rather by the human 15.5 kDa protein and/or Nop56/Nop58 (or their functional analogues in other organisms) and by the snoRNA components (5,41,42). However, since fibrillarin is the catalytic component of the C/D snoRNP, it is predicted to form critical contacts with the guide RNA (snoRNA) and target RNA (pre-rRNA) in the assembled C/D snoRNP complex. UV cross-linking of eukaryotic snoRNPs, where fibrillarin cross-linked to both D and D\u2032 boxes, supported this suggestion (41). The data concerning the RNA-binding properties of fibrillarin in vitro and regions of the protein responsible for this activity are limited and contradictory. While some reports show that fibrillarin binds directly and specifically to snoRNAs in the absence of additional factors (43,44), other reports suggest that this interaction requires other cofactors such as yeast Snu13p (15.5 kDa in human) (42,45). Furthermore, the archaeal fibrillarin proteins are unable to bind box C/D guide snoRNAs in vitro (46\u201348).",

For RNA-binding assays, the recombinant proteins were renatured, and urea was removed by dialysis of 0.1 ml protein sample against Milli-Q purified water for 1.5 h at room temperature with five changes of water. This method produced homogenous and non-aggregating recombinant AtFib2 protein monomers as shown previously by atomic force microscopy and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients (29). SDS\u2013PAGE confirmed the monomeric nature of the recombinant AtFib2 protein (fused to GST and 6\u00d7 His) (Supplementary Figure S1). Although E. coli-produced fibrillarin lacks post-translational modifications [for example, methylation (12)], this protein was able to form regular ring-like protein complexes with a virus protein, ORF3 (29) or functional (infectious) RNP complexes with virus RNA and ORF3 (16).

Positive or negative single-stranded (ss) short-interfering RNAs (21 nt) [siRNA171 (53)] were synthesized as RNA oligonucleotides by Syntol (Russia). Double-stranded (ds) RNAs were prepared by boiling equimolar quantities of complementary ssRNA substrates for 5 min and cooling for 3 h. 18S and 26S rRNAs were purified as follows. TAE 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide were prepared with two parallel rows of wells with a distance of 2\u20133 cm between the wells. Total RNA was extracted from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves as described (54) and loaded into the first row of wells along with the molecular weight markers. During the electrophoresis, the gel was inspected several times under the UV lamp and when the required band of RNA ran into the second row of wells, it was pipetted out and then precipitated with LiCl, resolved and its homogeneity was checked by the agarose electrophoresis.",

Interaction with \u2018non-specific\u2019 RNAs such as genomic RNAs of several plant viruses was also tested (Figure 2E and F). RNA-binding data are given as EMSA images (protein:RNA molar ratios are indicated) and as binding curves obtained from the EMSA results (the percentage of RNA involved in complex with the protein is plotted versus the protein concentration in the sample). In the presence of a small amount of fibrillarin, the RNA molecules were found mostly in unbound form, while increasing the amount of fibrillarin in the binding reaction resulted in rapid transition of the RNAs to completely bound form (retained in the wells of 2% native agarose gel after electrophoresis); this was true for all RNAs tested. The absence of partially shifted bands, resulting from limited binding of RNA by fibrillarin between the completely bound and the free RNA in the gel (Figure 2A, C and E), suggests that most of the RNAs are either coated with fibrillarin or are not bound to fibrillarin at all; a phenomenon that is clearly protein concentration dependent. Moreover, immunoblotting analysis of the gels using antibody against fibrillarin further confirmed that the fraction of free RNA did not contain detectable fibrillarin molecules (data not shown). The Hill coefficients in a range of 1.8\u20133.0 for RNA-binding by fibrillarin also imply that RNA-binding by fibrillarin occurs in a co-operative manner (Figure 2B, D and F).\n",

            "text": "Several well-studied silencing suppressors (p19, p21 and HC-Pro) inhibit the intermediate step of RNA silencing via binding to siRNAs (58). Some recent indications that fibrillarin may be involved in the process of suppression of gene silencing induced by viruses (30) prompted us to probe its ability to interact with siRNAs. Fibrillarin was able to bind both single-stranded (separate or mixed but non-annealed positive and negative) and double-stranded 21 nt siRNAs (Figure 3A) with the similar value of the apparent Kd of \u223c1.7 \u03bcM. However, while at the ratio of 1 molecule of AtFib2 per 1 molecule of siRNA 50% of both ss or double-stranded RNAs was bound by fibrillarin and the full retardation ratio for double-stranded siRNA was 20:1, complete binding of ss siRNA was not achieved at all: \u223c20% of ss molecules remained unbound (Figure 3A). To determine whether these differences in binding are due to generic differences in the structure of ss or double-stranded RNAs, we tested the binding of AtFib2 to 300-nt long dsRNA or ssRNA fragments (derived from the GFP gene). Remarkably, both these RNAs demonstrated similar affinity to fibrillarin (Kd of \u223c0.26 \u03bcM and of 0.23 \u03bcM, correspondingly, Figure 3B), suggesting no clear preferences of fibrillarin for ss or double-stranded RNAs. Furthermore, the binding behaviour of AtFib2 for a highly structured RNA substrate (tRNA) and to a 80 nt poly(A) sequence, which lacks secondary structure under conditions tested (pH 8.0), was also essentially similar (Kd were 0.19 \u03bcM for poly(A) and 0.17 \u03bcM for tRNA) (Figure 3C). Thus, it remains unclear why ss siRNAs show lower maximum binding than double-stranded siRNAs, although it cannot be ruled out that a portion of ss siRNA molecules (\u223c20%) may have a conformation unfavourable for binding by fibrillarin.\n",

For instance, fibrillarin interacts with long viral RNAs less effectively, than with rRNAs of similar length, and the least effective binding was demonstrated for very short RNAs (21 nt) suggesting that some unidentified yet structure/sequence preference of RNA binding by fibrillarin cannot be ruled out.",

This scheme shows the three main regions of the protein (indicated above the protein scheme): the N-terminal GAR domain, the central region containing the putative RNA-binding domain (R-region) and the C-terminal region containing the predicted sequence rich in \u03b1-helices. On the basis of sequence similarity (7,8) and X-ray crystallography data (10), the central and C-terminal regions were combined into an MTase domain, while the GAR domain and the following spacer were shown as the N-terminal domain. Based on this putative structure of AtFib2, we generated a series of deletion or substitution mutants to address RNA-binding (Figure 1B).",

Interestingly, the deletion of any of three previously predicted domains (7) also did not lead to reduction of RNA-binding activity (Figure 4A and Table 1). Indeed, the mutated fibrillarin proteins with a deleted GAR region (AtFib2\u0394GAR), R-region (AtFib2\u0394R) or \u03b1-rich region (AtFib2\u0394\u03b1-rich) demonstrated the same values of apparent Kd as the full-length protein (\u223c0.17 \u03bcM) for U3 snoRNA binding (Figure 4A). In the case of TMV RNA, the values of apparent Kd for AtFib2\u0394R and AtFib2\u0394\u03b1-rich mutants were slightly higher (\u223c0.7 \u03bcM versus 0.57 \u03bcM for the full-length protein).

Figure 4 demonstrates the binding of U3 snoRNA by the AtFib2 mutants. The binding parameters for the interaction of the AtFib2 mutants with U3 snoRNA and with TMV RNA are given in Table 1. The GAR domain (AtFib2GAR) showed no RNA-binding activity by itself or together with the spacer that connects it to the R-region (AtFib2GAR-spacer) (Figure 4A). At the same time, both the R region (AtFib2R) and the \u03b1-rich region (AtFib2\u03b1-rich) bound RNA in a similar manner (Figure 4B and C; Table 1). The binding parameters of these mutants differed from that of the full-length protein, but were similar to each other\u2014the apparent Kd values were 0.7\u20130.8 \u03bcM for U3 snoRNA and 2 \u03bcM for TMV RNA. The complete inclusion of RNA into the complex required higher protein:RNA molar ratios than for the full-length At2Fib (33:1 for U3 snoRNA and 700:1 for TMV RNA, Table 1). This effect could be partially due to the smaller size of the molecules of the mutant proteins compared to full-length fibrillarin, requiring more molecules to cover the given RNA. Interestingly, the substitution of the GCVYAVEF octamer with a sequence containing eight alanine residues reduced (but did not abolish) the RNA-binding of the isolated R region (AtFib2R-Ala) (Figure 4B)\u2014the apparent Kd values were 3.4 \u03bcM and 3.7 \u03bcM versus 0.7 \u03bcM and 2 \u03bcM for U3 snoRNA and TMV RNA, respectively.

Moreover, this work has been carried out with bacterially produced recombinant AtFib2 protein, which lacked posttranslational modifications. This protein was shown to be able to fulfil at least some of fibrillarin functions in vitro such as formation of regular ring-like protein complexes with the GRV ORF3 protein or functional (infectious) RNP particles with GRV RNA and ORF3 (16,29; see also \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section).

Low specificity of RNA binding by the plant fibrillarin is in good agreement with the data suggesting that the crucial role in targeting of the methylation snoRNP complex to the specific sites of pre-rRNAs is played by other core components (5,20,32,59). The 15.5 kDa protein initiates snoRNP assembly by specific recognition and binding of K-turn in the C/D site of snoRNAs (45). Then, Nop58 and fibrillarin are independently recruited to the snoRNA (41,45). In cross-linking experiments, Nop58 was in contact with the C box and showed a specific interaction (41). Nop56 is involved in the formation of snoRNP complex via interaction with fibrillarin and within the complex establishes direct and sequence-specific interactions with C\u2032 box of snoRNA (20,41,45). The mature snoRNP complex is directed to the site of methylation by sequence-specific duplex formation between guide snoRNA and pre-rRNA. Fibrillarin is the only core component of snoRNP that showed no specificity in RNA-binding (41). Fibrillarin has been cross-linked to the D, D\u2032 and C\u2032 box. In contrast to the situation with the other core proteins, mutations within the C\u2032 or D\u2032 boxes did not influence the binding of fibrillarin (41).",

The fact that fibrillarin is highly conserved among different species (7\u20139) has allowed us to apply the structural data obtained for the fibrillarin proteins of other species to AtFib2 in order to evaluate the structure of RNA-binding sites and their location on the molecule of fibrillarin (Figure 5A). Fibrillarin proteins belong to the superfamily of the Rossmann-fold SAM-dependent MTases (8). The nine sequence motifs that are strongly conserved among the MTases, including conserved SAM-binding motif and the catalytic triad/tetrad [K-D-K-(H)], have also been revealed in fibrillarin proteins of various species (60,61). Despite the rather low total homology in the amino acid sequence, these Rossmann-fold MTases share strikingly similar structure. It comprises a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices to form an \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 sandwich (62). The distinction of the R- and \u03b1-rich regions in MTase domain of fibrillarin (7) is consistent with the tertiary structure of Rossmann-fold MTases, and the presence of two RNA-binding sites in fibrillarin is in agreement with the suggested dimeric nature of the MTase domain (62). Min et al. (10) while studying the crystal structure of human fibrillarin discovered that it binds two Ca2+ ions. The divalent cations are often essential for polynucleotide binding. These data also might reflect the existence of two independent binding sites for RNA in fibrillarin.\n",

            "text": "To get an insight into the architecture of AtFib2 RNA-binding sites, we built a three-dimensional model of AtFib2 based on the available structure of the human fibrillarin (10). The model does not include a GAR region, as it is absent from the crystal structure of human fibrillarin (10). Figure 5B shows this model of AtFib2 depicted in cartoon form and as a molecular surface. Interestingly, both of the AtFib2 RNA-binding sites identified in this work are spatially separated and primarily exposed on the surface of the molecule (Figure 5B). The amino acid residues that were shown to interact with SAM analogue in human fibrillarin (10), E186-F187 and D211-A212 are located outside of the RNA-binding sites but in close proximity to them (Figure 5B). Furthermore, amino acid residues of the MTase catalytic triad of AtFib2, K138/D231/K260 reside within the R- (K138) and \u03b1-rich- (D231 and K260) RNA-binding sites (Figure 5A and B). Thus, it seems conceivable that the catalytic triad, SAM-binding site and adjoining parts of the RNA-binding domains form the united pocket of fibrillarin. Although the predicted structural model of AtFib2 active sites requires experimental verification, it provides a rationale for the involvement of two RNA-binding sites in formation of the MTase catalytic centre in fibrillarin. It is likely that these two RNA-binding sites (in a concert with other proteins, 15.5 kDa protein, Nop56/Nop58) can interact with guide (snoRNAs and scaRNAs) and substrate (rRNA, snRNAs) RNA molecules, respectively, to place their duplex containing the methylation site closer to the active SAM-binding centre. However, given the apparently low specificity of the fibrillarin RNA-binding sites, recognition of specific sequences on the guide and substrate RNAs by fibrillarin could be presumably determined by other components of snoRNPs (scaRNPs). At the same time, the lack of stringent specificity in RNA binding may account for interactions of fibrillarin with a wide range of guide (snoRNAs, scaRNAs) and substrate (rRNA, snRNAs) RNA molecules.",

            "text": "In addition to its major role in modification of rRNA and snRNAs, fibrillarin is also involved in other functions. Recent data indicate that interaction with fibrillarin is a general property of various virus proteins that is not restricted to one or two virus taxonomic groups [see for review (27)]. However, such interactions may have quite diverse molecular implications for different viruses being required at various phases of virus infection cycle such as virus movement, replication or counter defence (27). This may suggest novel, unexpected natural functions for fibrillarin that are hijacked or affected by viruses at different stages of infection for needs of the viruses. The ability of this nucleolar protein to bind a broad spectrum of various RNAs may be a key factor determining these functions.",

(A) Sequence alignment of fibrillarin homologues from various species was performed using ClustalW2 multiple sequence alignment (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html). The sources of aligned sequences are as follows: Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanocaldococcus) (accession number AAB98690.1), Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFib2) (accession number AAG10104.1) and Homo sapience (Homo) (accession number AAA52453.1). The similarity scores between AtFib2 and Metanocaldococcus and human fibrillarin homologues are 42 and 70%, respectively. Asterisks mark the identical residues in all sequences, colons mean the conserved substitutions, dots mean the semi-conserved substitutions. Elements of the secondary structure are labelled as in (8,62). The GCVYAVEF motif is shown in bold letters. The two RNA-binding regions determined here are marked with yellow (site within the R-region) or green (site within the \u2018\u03b1-rich\u2019 region) in the sequence alignment and structures below. The calcium-binding sites in the human fibrillarin (10) are indicated. The MTase catalytic triad K138/D231/K260 is indicated with filled triangle. The amino acid residues that were shown to interact with the SAM analogue in human fibrillarin (E186-F187 and D211-A212) are shown in purple. (B) The localization of the RNA-binding domains on the three-dimensional model of AtFib2 protein. A homology model of AtFib2 based on the structure of human fibrillarin [PDB 2IPX (10)] was built using MODELLER 9v7 with the graphic interface Easy Modeller 2.0. The structure does not include the GAR region as it is absent from the crystal structure of human fibrillarin (10). The localization of the RNA-binding regions is depicted in cartoon form and on a molecular surface in the same orientation (the surface models are given in two projections\u2014looking from the side of SAM-binding pocket and turned 180o around the vertical axis). The RNA-binding regions are coloured as in (A). The amino acid residues that were shown to interact with SAM analogue in human fibrillarin (E186-F187 and D211-A212) are shown in purple and labelled. Amino acid residues of the MTase catalytic triad of AtFib2, K138/D231/K260 are also labelled. Ligands are indicated as follows: two Ca2+ ions are shown as blue spheres and the SAM analogue is shown as red sticks. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (www.pymol.org).",
