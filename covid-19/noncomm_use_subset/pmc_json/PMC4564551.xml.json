Sequences encoding previously described N- and C-terminal fragments of human codon-optimized GLuc [28] were synthesized (Genscript). The fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of Gluc (GlucN), lacking a signal peptide, was fused to the C-terminus of EBOV VP40, lacking a stop codon, using overlap extension PCR, and the PCR product was inserted into plasmid pCAGGS. The fragment encoding GLucC was inserted into plasmid pcDNA3.1. The integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was verified by automated sequence analysis.",

Therefore, we also determined whether IFITM proteins from rhesus macaques are expressed in transduced cells and inhibit GP-driven entry. The rhesus macaque genome does not encode IFITM2 [31] but encodes two variants of IFITM3, IFITM3(1) and IFITM3(2). Expression of rhesus macaque IFITM proteins was readily detectable, although expression of IFITM3(1) was reduced compared with that of IFITM3(2) (Figure 1C). The IFITM homologues of rhesus macaques displayed antiviral activity, with IFITM3(1) being most active (Figure 1B, lower panel), despite its reduced expression. Thus, IFITM proteins of human and rhesus macaque origin can block entry driven by GPs from diverse ebola- and marburgviruses in cell culture, suggesting that IFITM proteins could act as panfiloviral inhibitors in infected nonhuman primates and in humans.",

Mutation of SVKS in IFITM3, which had no appreciable effect on protein expression (Figure 4C), abrogated the blockade of EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry and markedly augmented transduction mediated by LLOV-GP (Figure 4D). Similarly, cellular entry of EBOV-like particles bearing LLOV-GP was augmented by the SVKS mutant, and expression of this protein also increased EBOV-GP\u2013dependent entry (Figure 4E).

The antiserum modestly inhibited EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry into control cells (3-fold reduction) and had no appreciable effect on FLUAV-HA\u2013 and LASV-GPC\u2013driven entry into these cells (Figure 5).

Furthermore, the roughly 10-fold inhibition of EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry on IFITM3 expression alone was increased to 1000-fold when vectors were incubated with GP-specific antiserum, and similar effects were not observed for FLUAV-HA and LASV-GPC, although an 8\u201310-fold augmentation of inhibition efficiency was measured (Figure 5). Finally, preimmune serum did not modulate transduction efficiency, indicating that the effects observed were specific.

Moreover, IFITM expression was reported to inhibit host cell entry of authentic EBOV and MARV [12], and our present findings demonstrate that entry of vectors pseudotyped with diverse filovirus GPs is also blocked. These observations indicate that IFITM proteins might constitute a panfiloviral defense in the infected host. This defense could slow down but not prevent viral spread and seems to be operative in humans and nonhuman primates, as evidenced by the blockade of filovirus-GP\u2013driven entry by rhesus macaque IFITM proteins. Moreover, the panfiloviral inhibition suggests that all filovirus GPs, including LLOV-GP, depend on similar if not identical cellular factors and/or processes for host cell entry. This notion is in agreement with two recent reports [37, 38] indicating that the GPs of LLOV and EBOV use identical factors for attachment (C-type lectins) and entry (NPC1) and that entry driven by both GPs depends on GP proteolysis by endosomal cysteine proteases. The amount of GP incorporated into viral particles does not seem to modulate IFITM sensitivity. Thus, retroviral particles bearing low, intermediate, and high amounts of EBOV-GP and RESTV-GP exhibited comparable susceptibility to inhibition by IFITM proteins (Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that the block imposed by IFITM proteins might not be saturable by excess GP copies presented at the virion surface. In sum, IFITM proteins are comparably active against entry driven by all filoviral GPs, although subtle differences in inhibition efficiency might have remained undetected owing to the limited resolution of our assay, and it will be interesting to examine the contribution of these proteins to the control of viral spread in the host. IFITM knockout mice [19, 39] might be suitable tools for these endeavors.",

However, subsequent work challenged this concept [14, 17, 18], and reduction of endosomal cholesterol levels did not rescue EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry from blockade by IFITM proteins in the present study (not shown). Recent studies revealed that the antimycotic compound amphotericin B disables IFITM-dependent inhibition of FLUAV [18] and retrovirus entry [40] in cell culture, and amphotericin B treatment of mice was shown to abrogate control of FLUAV infection [18]. The underlying mechanism was not fully clarified, but a role for membrane fluidity was suggested. The present study shows that IFITMs might block FLUAV-HA- and EBOV-GP-mediated entry via different mechanisms, since EBOV-GP-driven entry was not rescued by amphotericin B treatment. Thus, further work is required to clarify how GP-driven entry is inhibited. These studies might be aided by the observation that mutation of an SVKS motif\u2014required for the antiretroviral activity of IFITM1 [25] and the anti-dengue/FLUAV activity of IFITM3 [34] - potentiates LLOV-GP\u2013driven entry, because it suggests that IFITM proteins might be able to positively and negatively regulate a cellular process critical for filovirus entry. This concept is in keeping with the finding that the human coronavirus OC43 can use IFITM proteins as cofactors for infectious viral entry into target cells [41].",

We observed that IFITM3 and an otherwise poorly neutralizing antiserum directed against GP can synergistically inhibit EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry. Although the responsible mechanism remains to be elucidated, this finding suggests that antibodies with unimpressive neutralizing capacity in standard cell culture systems, for instance Vero cells (which exhibit low endogenous IFITM expression [12]), might still unfold substantial antiviral activity in the host, where IFITM expression is induced by IFNs. In this context, a finding by Kajihara and colleagues [43] is noteworthy; they reported that antibodies unable to block cellular entry of MARV still displayed potent antiviral activity by blocking GP-promoted release of progeny particles from infected cells.",
