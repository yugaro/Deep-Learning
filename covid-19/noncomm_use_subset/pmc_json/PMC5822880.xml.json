It is caused by the\ngammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012; Jackwood and de Wit 2013). Some strains of IBV are\nstrongly nephropathogenic, and may cause nephrosis\u2014nephritis, urolithiasis, and\nmortality (Jackwood and de Wit 2013).\nThe disease occurs worldwide and pose significant economic burden to the poultry\nindustry. Protection against the disease mainly relies on vaccination, which,\nhowever, is complicated by the high mutation rate and recombinations in the viral\ngenome, especially when these affect immunologically important epitopes, such as the\nones present in the spike viral glycoprotein (S) gene (Thor et al. 2011; Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012). As a result, several genotypes and\nserotypes of IBV exist and evolve over time, some of which persist and spread, while\nothers disappear shortly. This variation undermines vaccinal protection against IB\ndue to insufficient or the lack of cross-protection between the serotypes.",

In the routine, the PCR-based\ndetection of IBV is best achieved by targeting a conservative region of the viral\ngenome, such as the 5\u2032UTR (Callison et al.\n2006), followed by a \u2018characterizing\u2019 assay, which targets a region that\nallows genotyping upon nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The S gene\nof IBV is suitable for such purposes, and the protocol of Capua et al. (1999), which targets\u223c400-nucleotide long\nfragment of the S1 gene, has been widely used with this objective. Accordingly, a\nnumber of related sequence data have been deposited in the GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) and genetic relatedness of strains are\noften based on these data. However, due to possible recombination events, grouping\nestablished on a certain fragment of a gene might change when investigating\nanother/larger fragment of the same gene. Analysing the sequence data of different\ngene(s), or the whole virus genome, may also result in different grouping (Cavanagh, Davis and Cook 1992).",

The initial finding was that D1456-like strains\nformed a separate group within the Variant 2 IBV cluster, and grouped together with\nCk/Eg/BSU-2/2011 (JX174185) and Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011 (JX174186) strains, which were\nreported to represent a new group of variant IBVs by Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady (2012). Throughout\n2010\u20132015 altogether seventeen submissions yielded partial S1 sequences. Further\nEgyptian strains, accessed in GenBank, clustered together with this group, that is,\nEg/1265B/2012 (KC533682), Eg/12197B/2012 (KC533683), and Eg/12120s/2012 (KC533684).\nThe rest of the Egyptian sequences published by Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady (2012), fall into the\ngroup of Variant 2-like viruses, named IS/1494/06 group by Ganapathy, Ball and Forrester (2015) together with the\nEgypt/Beni-Suef/01 strain. In order to have a more accurate depiction on the\nphylogenetic relationships of the studied viruses, isolates from different years\nwere selected (D1456/1/10 EG, D1795/2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG, D1903/21/12 EG,\nD2572/2/2/14 EG, D1795/2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG, and D2930/3/1/1/15EG) and\nsubjected to a broader scale S1 gene nucleotide sequence determination.",

Improving\nvaccination efficiency and understanding IBV evolution better requires the knowledge\nand characterization of circulating IBV variants in a given region.

(1999). The reported \u201cvariant 2\u201d strains\ngrouped together with those we have detected since 2010 in Egypt by the same\nprotocol, and designated as the \u201cD1456-like\u201d group, which showed\nseparation from the Israeli variant genetic group. The rest of the Egyptian isolates\nreported by the above referred authors (Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady 2012) belonged to the Israeli variant 2\nstrains (called \u201cvariant 1\u201d by the same authors). These findings support the need\nfor a uniform nomenclature of IBVs to avoid misunderstandings among researchers,\ndiagnosticians, as expressed by the current European Cooperation in Science and\nTechnology (COST) Action FA1207 (http://cost-controllingaviancoronaviruses.org/) also, and as\nproposed recently by Valastro et al.\n(2016). The near complete S1 gene phylogeny of the representative\nD1456-like strains showed a certain separation, which was explained by the revealed\nrecombination events in the gene both by breakpoint and network analysis. Two types\nof recombinants were identified, represented by four and two strains of our\ncollection, which affected two or one antigenic domain of the S1 gene, respectively.\nThis presumably has immunological consequences. Such a phenomenon, when a 793/B\nserotype strain shifted to H120 serotype due to recombination of the 5\u2032 terminal of\nthe S1 gene was recently reported (Zhang et\nal. 2015). This aspect can best be investigated in relevant animal\ntrials. Nevertheless, the finding that geographically and temporarily related\nsequences, which were deposited in the GenBank, showed the same recombination\npattern that was revealed for the D1456-like viruses, thus further confirming the\noccurrence of this type of IBVs.",
