Newly emerging viral diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks not only lead to wide-spread loss of life and health, but also result in heavy economic losses. To better navigate this landscape of infectious diseases, it is important to not only understand the mechanisms of individual diseases, but also the commonalities between them. Combining knowledge from related diseases will give us deeper insights into infection and host immune response, will enhance our ability to comprehend new diseases and lead to efficient development of therapeutics.",

Via these protein interactions, the pathogen manipulates important biological processes in the host cell, evades host immune response and multiplies within the host. Interactions between host and pathogen proteins can be studied using small-scale biochemical, biophysical and genetic experiments or large-scale high-throughput screening methods like yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. Databases like PHI-base (Winnenburg et al., 2008), PIG (Driscoll et al., 2009), HPIDB (Kumar and Nanduri, 2010), PHISTO (Tekir et al., 2012) aggregate host\u2013pathogen protein interactions from several small-scale and high-throughput experiments via manual literature curation. These databases are valuable sources of information for developing models of the modus operandi of pathogens.",

(2010) show how various bacterial cyclomodulins target the host cell cycle. The study by Mukhtar et al. (2011) on plant pathogens, in particular, Arabidopsis concludes that pathogens from different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence proteins that interact with a limited set of highly connected cellular hubs to facilitate their diverse life cycle strategies.

Another line of work in PPI prediction (Xu et al., 2010) uses the Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) approach proposed by Singh and Gordon (2008). The CMF method learns models for multiple networks by simultaneously factorizing several adjacency matrices and sharing parameters amongst the factors. Xu et al. (2010) use these ideas in their transfer learning setting, where the source network is a relatively dense interaction network of proteins and the objective is to infer PPI edges in a relatively sparse target network. To compute similarities between the nodes in the source and target networks, they use protein sequences and the topological structures of the interaction networks.",

This analysis also motivates our choice of a multitask approach that uses a pathway-based similarity across tasks. The known PPIs are compared across datasets in two ways: (i) pathway enrichment and (ii) presence of interologs.\nThe human proteins involved in each interaction dataset are used to obtain the human pathways that are enriched. We use Fisher\u2019s test (based on the hypergeometric distribution) to compute the P-value of each pathway. We plot these P-values for each pathway, and for each dataset in the form of a heatmap shown in Figure 4. The heatmap shows how there are several commonly enriched pathways across the datasets (the black vertical lines spanning all four rows). It also shows the difference in the enrichment for the S.typhi dataset, which comes from small-scale PPI experiments.We analyze the similarity between the PPIs from various datasets. A natural way to determine similarity is to check if proteins known to interact in one dataset have homologous proteins that are also interacting in another dataset. Such pairs of proteins, also called \u2018interologs\u2019, are defined as a quadruple of proteins , where  (interaction) and . Further, A,  are homologs and B,  are also homologs. The number of such interologs existing between the four datasets is shown in Table 2. To compute homologs of a protein, we used BLASTP sequence alignment with an e-value cutoff of 0.1. As evident from Table 2, there are few interologs across the bacterial PPIs. None of the high-throughput datasets have an interolog in the small-scale S.typhi dataset. This seems to indicate that interolog-based approaches to compute task similarity are not relevant here. The phenomenon governing the similarity of these host\u2013pathogen interactions is probably at a much higher level, rather than at the level of individual proteins. We explore one such possibility\u2014the \u2018commonality hypothesis\u2019.\n\n",

The performance of all baselines is similar, and our method outperforms the best of the baselines by a margin of 4 points for B.anthracis, 3.4 points for F.tularensis and 3.2 points for Y.pestis and 3.3 for S.typhi. The overall performance of all methods on this dataset is twice as good as that on the others. We believe that the difference in the nature of the datasets might explain the above observations. While the S.typhi dataset comprises small-scale interaction studies, the other datasets come from high-throughput experiments. Owing to its smaller size, it has less variance making it an easier task. This dataset is also likely to be a biased sample of interactions, as it comes from focussed studies targeting select proteins.\n",

The training set is then constructed using a bootstrap sample from the 80% split and the test data from the 20% split. A total of 50 models are thus trained and evaluated.
