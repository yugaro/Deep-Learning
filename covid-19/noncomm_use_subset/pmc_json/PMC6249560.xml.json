Several studies have indicated a role for autophagy proteins in macropinosome trafficking into cells and that macropinocytosis and autophagy pathways are regulated by similar signaling molecules [9, 10, 22]. To investigate whether autophagy-associated proteins generally control macropinocytosis, we measured the impact of Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B depletion on uptake of fluorescently labeled 70000-kDa dextran, which is taken up exclusively in macropinosomes [23]. One hour after addition, in NT-siRNA treated cells, dextran distribution appeared in numerous vesicles throughout the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2A). Depletion of LC3B caused nearly complete cessation of dextran uptake, while depletion of Becn1 or Atg7 resulted in a substantial drop in uptake, with the number of dextran-containing vesicles per cell decreasing by >80% (P < .05; Supplementary Figure 2B). These findings indicate that autophagy-associated proteins are directly required for dextran uptake and therefore have important roles in macropinocytosis and likely EBOV infection.",

Depleting cells of LC3B or its processing proteins resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in VSV-EBOVGP-Luc infection, mirroring that observed for the wild-type EBOV (Figures 1A and C). In contrast, a pseudotype bearing VSV G (VSV-VSVG-Luc), known to enter cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [24, 25], was not significantly affected (P > .05; Figure 1D), suggesting that control of EBOV infection by the autophagy-associated proteins is dependent on EBOV GP and therefore specific for EBOV entry and that the effects of the siRNA treatments were not due to cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "Macropinocytosis is a multistage process consisting of macropinocytic cup formation and closure at the cell surface and trafficking of the resulting endosome to fuse with lysosomes or recycling back to the cell surface [26, 27]. Although our data clearly demonstrate a requirement for autophagy proteins in EBOV cell entry, it was unclear which step of virus entry was affected. Virus binding was synchronized by maintaining siRNA-treated cells at 14\u00b0C, a temperature known to block membrane rearrangements, including endocytic uptake, while not perturbing the cell cytoskeleton [28]. EBOV uptake was then allowed to proceed for various periods by raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C. Cells were subsequently stained with an anti-GP antibody before (to detect cell surface particles) and after permeabilization with nonionic detergent (to stain all particles). The assay has a background of approximately 15% of particles being scored as internalized at time 0. This is due to 14\u00b0C allowing a low level of uptake and incomplete access of antibodies to all particles. Binding to the cell surface was unaffected in cells depleted of Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B, with a subset of particles accumulating at limited sites on the cell periphery (Figure 2A and 2B). In contrast, internalization of virus was significantly abrogated, with comparable numbers of virions remaining on the cell surface throughout the incubation, whereas cells treated with nontargeting siRNA showed a progressive increase in the number of internalized virus particles, with a 3-fold increase after 240 minutes (P < .05; Figure 2A and 2C). Large virus aggregates were also more pronounced in Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B siRNA-treated cells, suggesting accumulation of particles unable to enter cells, but these were not quantified. These results demonstrate that proteins known to associate with the autophagy pathway likely control an early step of EBOV uptake, close to the cell surface.",

            "text": "To test the effect of autophagy protein deficiency on macropinosome biogenesis at the cell surface, association of EBOV particles with endogenous Ankfy1 was measured. Consistent with the essential role of Ankfy1 in macropinosome formation [7], depletion of Ankfy1 efficiently blocked EBOV infection (P < .05; Figure 3A and 3B). In cells treated with NT siRNA, a progressive association of virus and endogenous Ankfy1 peaked at 60 minutes and then dropped to 50% of the peak level by 240 minutes (Figure 3C and 3D). This timing is consistent with previous measurements of EBOV uptake into cells [3, 4, 29]. In contrast, twice as many virions associated with Ankfy1, before endocytosis was allowed to proceed, in cells depleted of the autophagy proteins. This finding suggests arrested internalization of Ankfy1 and EBOV. Importantly, after only 10 minutes, the association plateaued, similar to that seen at 60 minutes with the nontargeting siRNA and remained at this level throughout the incubation (Figure 3C and 3D), demonstrating that, despite the lack of uptake, virus particles remained associated with macropinosomes at the cell surface. These and previous data (Figure 2A and 2C) indicate that lack of expression of autophagy regulators resulted in aberrant macropinosome trafficking into cells, confirming that the arrest of macropinosome formation and, therefore, EBOV uptake occurred at the cell membrane.",

Because LC3B localization to autophagosomes is necessary for the vesicle formation [14, 15], we tested LC3B for the ability to localize to and facilitate formation of macropinocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane. Cells overexpressing LC3B fused at its N-terminus to myc tag (myc-LC3B) and Ankfy1 fused to EYFP (EYFP-Ankfy1) were stained with anti-myc antibody. The 2 signals colocalized extensively inside the cell, indicating that LC3B associates with macropinocytic vesicles, consistent with a previous report [8]. Interestingly, a subset of LC3B-Ankfy1 colocalization was also observed close to the plasma membrane (Figure 4A). Our observations that LC3B associates with the macropinocytic marker, Ankfy1, and EBOV, which requires macropinocytosis for cell infection, at the cell surface suggest that LC3B may have a role in an early stage of macropinocytosis. However, because both the anti-myc (Figure 4A) and the anti-LC3B (Figure 4B) antibodies recognized the N-terminal domain of the protein, it was unclear whether the unlipidated form, LC3B-I, and/or the fully processed form, LC3B-II, was required for the association.",

These results, together with observations above (Figure 4C), suggest that, although both LC3B-I and LC3B-II have an inherent ability to associate with Ankfy1 and, therefore, macropinosomes, the lipidated form appears to be indispensable for macropinosome endocytosis and, therefore, EBOV movement into the cell.",

The mechanistic details of the autophagy-virus interaction appear to be extraordinarily complex and are usually unique for each virus [31]. Our results show that, for EBOV, the autophagy pathway is essential to establish infection in host cells. Silencing key pathway regulators significantly blocked infection by the wild-type virus and the pseudotype (Figure 1), demonstrating that autophagy-associated proteins control an entry step of EBOV. There have been few studies reporting involvement of autophagy proteins in virus entry, and those that do exist provide little information about the mechanism(s), aside from the fact that most likely it involves an intracellular trafficking step [32, 33]. We clearly demonstrate that autophagy regulators control internalization of EBOV from the plasma membrane (Figure 4). We also show that virions recruited and colocalized with LC3B-positive structures at the plasma membrane.",

Since the majority of the current literature describes LC3B as being either cytosolic when unprocessed or as associated with intracellular phagocytic or autophagic membranes when lipidated [34, 35], our observations of LC3B at the cell membrane were somewhat unexpected. Investigation into the origin of autophagosomal membranes identified the plasma membrane as one likely source, where the autophagy regulator Atg16L1 is commonly found [36]. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that basal levels of LC3B can be found at the plasma membrane, presumably in its lipidated form. Our data show that both precursor and processed forms of LC3B strongly interacted with Ankfy1 in both colocalization and immunoprecipitation assays. Since Ankfy1 shows a strong association with macropinosomes throughout the endocytic pathway, LC3B similarly has an affinity for macropinocytic structures, including those at the cell surface (Figure 4).",

It will be important to elucidate whether other viruses that have macropinocytosis-dependent infection mechanisms, such as filamentous forms of influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus, similarly depend on autophagy-associated proteins for entry into cells. If, as expected, they do, it may enable the development of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that interfere with macropinocytosis by inhibiting specific autophagy proteins. Although this approach may influence essential host functions that involve macropinocytosis or autophagy, such as the innate immune response, acute virus infections should only require brief treatments and so could be tolerated. Several specific inhibitors of autophagy proteins, including PI3K and Atg7, have entered preclinical development for potential use in cancer treatment [38]. If such indicators prove to be effective and safe, they could be useful for treatment of infections by macropinocytic-dependent viruses and other pathogens.",
