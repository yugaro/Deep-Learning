Because of the similarities between the 2 CoVs, treatment with ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b has been suggested as a potential therapy for MERS CoV. Recently published data in animal models show that MERS CoV is sensitive to ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b combination therapy.14 Both drugs were able to kill the virus at high doses individually, whereas a combination of ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b had a synergistic killing effect at much lower doses with possible lower toxicity. The animal studies have also shown some prophylactic effects in reducing the severity of the disease in animals.",
