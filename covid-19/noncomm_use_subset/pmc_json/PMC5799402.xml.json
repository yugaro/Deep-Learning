Since PEDV was first isolated (CV777 strain) in Belgium in 1978 [19], PED outbreaks have been identified regularly in Europe and Asia, including Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam [71020]. More recently, a PED outbreak occurred suddenly in the USA in 2013 and spread to Canada and Mexico [117]. Since a live-attenuated PEDV vaccine was developed from a Korean PEDV isolate (SM98 strain) obtained from naturally infected piglets in Korea in 1998, PED vaccines have been used in pig farms to prevent PED outbreaks [11]. However, PED continues to be a major threat to the Korean pork industry [21]. In March 2014, a large number of PEDV infections occurred unexpectedly in many Korean pig farms, which had a significant economic impact on swine farms due to a high mortality rate among newborn piglets [12].",

The PEDV genome is composed of at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), encoding three non-structural proteins (ORF1a, 1b, and ORF3) and four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S glycoprotein mediates neutralizing antibodies in pigs and viral attachment to target cells and has been reported to bind to carbohydrate (sialic acid) and proteinaceous (aminopeptidase N) cell surface molecules [14]. The M protein has an important role in assembly of the viral nucleocapsid and membrane [23]. The N protein binds to viral RNA and provides a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid [6]. In addition, the N protein participates in transcription of the viral genome, formation of the viral core, and packaging of viral RNA [20]. Therefore, investigation of structural proteins is suitable for elucidating the epidemiological and molecular statuses of PEDV isolates.",

Growing pure PEDV in a cell culture system has been attempted in many veterinary laboratories but has proven difficult because of many factors, such as fecal toxins, other viral contaminants, and the trypsin concentration. Although PEDV can be detected in cells after one or two passages, the virus tends to lose infectivity after additional passages. A few reports are available regarding successful culture of Korean PEDV isolates since the first isolation of PEDV [111221]. In this study, we attempted to isolate field PEDV from 30 PEDV-positive samples by using Vero cells. Two PEDV strains, designated QIAP1401 and QIAP1402, were isolated successfully, and the QIAP1401 strain was passaged 70 times in cell culture. We characterized the biological properties of the QIAP1401 strain during serial passage, and the nucleotide sequences of the QIAP1401 strain structural genes were determined after specific passages to evaluate genetic relationships. In addition, we investigated the pathogenicity of the QIAP1401 strain in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old pigs.",

Group 2 comprised seven 11-week-old growing pigs seronegative for PEDV. The pigs were orally administered 1 mL 105.0 TCID50/mL QIAP1401-P70 via 5 mL pipette. All pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs of PEDV infection, such as watery diarrhea and dehydration. Clinical or RT-PCR scores were divided into four grades: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Stool samples were collected daily from all pigs using cotton-tipped swabs and were subjected to the rapid detection and RT-PCR kits to detect the PEDV antigen. The four piglets in group 1 were necropsied. Small intestinal tissues collected from each pig were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin according to standard procedures. The deparaffinized intestinal tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic examination. A PEDV-N specific monoclonal antibody was used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. The antigen was detected by using an avidin-biotin kit (Ventana Medical System, USA) and an automatic immunohistochemical stainer (Ventana Medical System). Epithelial cells within intestinal samples that turned brown were considered positive. The pigs in group 2 were observed for 3 weeks post-inoculation, but were not necropsied.",

Two PEDV isolates, designated QIAP1401 and QIAP1402, grew successfully in Vero cells inoculated with small intestinal samples from piglets from the Jeju-do pig farms (collected 26 May 2014). As shown in Fig. 1, clear CPEs, characterized by cell fusion and large syncytia, were observed in the QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 isolates after the second passage. The supernatants from the two isolates were analyzed by the rapid detection kit and were positive for PEDV presence. No difference in CPEs was observed between the QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 isolates. The two PEDV isolates were further passaged serially to confirm efficient propagation. Distinct CPEs were usually observed in Vero cells infected with each isolate within 30 h post-inoculation, and large cells containing many nuclei and floating cells were observed over time. After fixing the cells with cold acetone and staining with the 7G7 monoclonal antibody, specific fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of Vero cells infected with QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 (Fig. 2). The QIAP1401 strain was serially passaged 70 times in Vero cells, and the viral titers of QIAP1401-P10, -P40, and -P70 cultured in roller bottles were 106.5, 106.8, and 107.0 TCID50/mL, respectively (panel A in Fig. 2). The QIAP1401-P10, -P40 and -P70 viral titers peaked at 105.7, 106.0, and 106.7 TCID50/mL, respectively, at 36 h post-inoculation (panel B in Fig. 2). We concluded that the QIAP1401 strain adapted to the Vero cells because the titer increased continuously until passage 70.",

As a result, several Korean isolates, such as the KPV1405, KNU1307, and BM1 strains isolated from the feces of naturally infected piglets, were reported [412]. We attempted to isolate PEDV from 30 intestinal homogenates and obtained the QIAP1401 and QIP1402 strains from Vero cells. They were confirmed to be PEDV based on CPEs, IFA, EM, and RT-PCR results. An appropriate trypsin concentration and Vero cell line were essential for isolating PEDV in cell culture [813]. In this study, we found that ATCC-CCL81 Vero cells were more suitable for propagating field PEDV than were ATCC-1586 Vero cells, and 2 \u00b5g/mL trypsin at 37\u2103 for 1 h before inoculation into the Vero cells and medium containing 1 or 1.5 \u00b5g/mL crystalized trypsin were critical for propagating PEDV (data not shown). Subsequently, one of the new PEDV isolates has been used to develop a vaccine candidate for live and inactivated PEDV vaccines. New vaccines based on the current strains are needed because the PEDV vaccine based on the SM98 or DR13 strains might be less related antigenically to the re-emerged PEDV strains [241822].One of the two isolates in this study was serially propagated 70 times in Vero cells. The viral titer of QIAP1401 reached 107.0 TCID50/mL by passage 70, indicating that the QIAP1401-P70 strain was adapted to the Vero cells and could be used as a vaccine strain.",

If this relationship is factual, it remains unclear how the PEDV variant was introduced into Korea. A molecular epidemiologist suggested that the Korean PEDV variant strains may have been transmitted directly or indirectly from USA PEDV strains that circulated in 2013 and 2014 [3]. The SM98-1 strain has a 52-nucleotide deletion between the end of the S protein and the start of ORF3 [12].

[16] reported that 3- and 4-week-old pigs infected with a US PEDV isolate resulted in mild to moderate clinical disease. In this study, 11-week-old growing pigs inoculated with the QIAP1401-P70 strain were positive 1 to 10 DPI by RT-PCR and positive 2 to 10 DPI based on clinical scores. However, we could not detect virus shed in feces by RT-PCR or by the clinical score at \u2265 11 DPI, indicating that the QIAP1401 strain induces moderate to severe watery diarrhea during a relatively short period in 11-week-old pigs.",
