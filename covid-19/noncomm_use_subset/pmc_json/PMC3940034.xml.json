The majority of infections have been identified in the KSA with lower numbers in Jordan, Qatar, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. Although cases have also been reported in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, all have been linked to the Middle East either by travel of the individuals infected through an area where MERS-CoV has been reported or by direct or indirect contact with others who have a travel history consistent with exposure in the Middle East (3).",

Analysis of human MERS-CoV sequences by Cotten et al. has revealed the presence of at least three circulating genotypes within the KSA alone (6). Phylogenetic analyses of 13 complete and 8 partial genome sequences enabled estimates of the timing and geographic origins of individual viral clades. The authors proposed that MERS-CoV emerged in humans in 2011 and noted that sequence divergence between clades is consistent with several sporadic introductions of the virus into the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir.",

            "text": "Efforts to identify an animal reservoir have focused on bats and camels. Bats harbor a wide range of betacoronaviruses (7); furthermore, bat cell lines display the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (8), and can be experimentally infected. A short sequence fragment consistent with MERS-CoV was reported in a bat in Bisha, KSA, collected in close proximity to the home and workplace of the 2012 index case patient from whom the initial virus isolate was obtained (9). That same patient owned four pet dromedary camels (DC). Serological analysis of those DC revealed the presence of antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV; however, no MERS-CoV sequences were found by PCR analysis of nasal or rectal swabs or serum. Additional human cases have been associated with exposure to DC, and in some instances, investigators have described both serologic and genetic evidence of MERS-CoV infection in DC. Memish and coworkers reported PCR detection of MERS-CoV sequences in a DC with respiratory illness owned by an individual with MERS-CoV who had no history of contact with other infected humans (10). Haagmans et al. investigated an outbreak of the disease among humans on a Qatari farm and found MERS-CoV sequences in nasal swabs from 6 of 14 seropositive DC. Analysis of open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and fragments representing ORF1b, spike, and ORF4b revealed similarity but not identity to sequences obtained from the MERS-CoV-infected humans at the same farm. The authors provide evidence that MERS-CoV can infect DC but cautiously conclude that data are insufficient to determine whether the infection spread from DC to humans, from humans to DC, or via another host to both species (11).",

We also collected archived serum samples obtained from DC in 1992 through 2010 (Table 2). Sera were initially tested for the presence of antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV by using a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV. Subsets of sera positive by ELISA were tested in Western blot assays that used extracts of Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV and a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay based on recombinant MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Potential serologic cross-reactivity with bovine coronavirus (Bo-CoV) was addressed by testing for reactivity with Bo-CoV nucleocapsid protein by LIPS assay. The presence of viral nucleic acids in rectal and nasal swabs and a subset of serum and whole blood samples was assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with primers targeting the upE and ORF1a genome regions of MERS-CoV (16, 17).",

The lowest prevalence of seropositive juveniles was found in the southwestern region, in proximity to the city of Gizan (1/21, 5%) (Fig. 1A). A higher prevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in older animals was also seen in samples obtained in years prior to 2012.

In 2009, the seroprevalence was 72% (40/56) in juveniles versus 92% (24/26) in adults (Riyadh, Rumah) (Table 2). Seroreactivity was also found in samples collected from DC as early as the 1990s: 1/1 (100%) in 1992, 2/2 (100%) in 1993, 114/123 (93%) in 1994, 6/6 (100%) in 1996, and 6/6 (100%) in 2003. Analysis of selected seropositive DC sera by Western immunoblot assay indicated two distinct reaction patterns that showed reactivity either to MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein alone or to spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. These results were concordant with results of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid LIPS assays (Fig. 2; see Table S1 in the supplemental material).",

Nonetheless, as noted by Nishiura and colleagues, current data do not fulfill the two criteria required to implicate DC as a significant reservoir species in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV (19), i.e., (i) that DC are sufficient to maintain MERS-CoV and (ii) that the presence of DC is essential to the continuous transmission of infection.

Analysis of specimens from western regions of the country, from Tabuk in the northwest, Taif in the west, and Gizan in the southwest, revealed regional differences. Although the seroprevalence was high in adults throughout the country at >80%, in juveniles, it ranged from 90% in the east to 5% in the southwest. The seroprevalence in DC \u22642 years of age was lower than that in older animals, confirming the results of Hemida et al. (15). Molecular analysis of nasal and rectal swab specimens indicated the highest prevalence of MERS-CoV sequences in DC in the west and northwest. Nasal swabs with heavy sequence loads (>105 copies) also clustered in the Taif region. A second sample collection in the west (Taif) separated from the first by an interval of 2 months confirmed the presence of heavy viral sequence loads in nasal swabs collected from juvenile animals sampled in this area (data not shown). These findings suggest that continuous, longer-term surveillance is necessary to determine the dynamics of virus circulation in DC populations. Lower prevalence rates of both MERS-CoV and Bo-CoV were evident in samples from the southwest. This may relate in part to the enforcement of restrictions of livestock movement in and out of Gizan Province implemented after the Rift Valley fever outbreak in 2000 but also to the generally lower DC population density in this region than in other regions of the KSA.",

Complete genomic sequences of MERS-CoV found in contemporary DC in the KSA are identical to sequences of viruses recovered from human MERS-CoV victims (unpublished data). Although we speculate that DC are potential reservoirs for human transmission, we cannot prove this relationship from the current data. Rigorous epidemiological investigation of the potential for exposure to DC in sporadic cases of MERS-CoV (those where there is no opportunity for human-to-human transmission) is required to test this model. If DC can be implicated, other questions will arise. Did MERS-CoV truly emerge as a human pathogen in 2012, or were cases of cryptic infection not appreciated because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tests? We may be able to address this conundrum by using archived human materials. If evidence of human MERS-CoV infections cannot be detected prior to 2012, we must entertain the possibility that mutation facilitated cross-species transmission. However, we see no path to address this possibility absent access to historical DC respiratory tract specimens. The only archived DC specimens we have been able to locate are DC sera; our efforts to recover MERS-CoV sequences from camel blood have been unsuccessful. What are the roles of bats, if any, as reservoirs of MERS-CoV? These limitations notwithstanding, the most urgent public health concern, raised in work we and others have reported that focuses on DC infection, is to determine the role of these animals in sporadic human infection. The evidence is clearly sufficient to support targeted investigation of direct or indirect exposure to DC in the disease among humans.",
