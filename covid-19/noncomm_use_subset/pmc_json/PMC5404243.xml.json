The call center was contracted out to one of the largest phone companies in Taiwan to provide service in 4 languages (Mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese, Hakka, and English). Taiwan CDC has provided materials and training to help customer service staff answer questions. If the staff are unable to answer a question, the call will be transferred to Taiwan CDC staff for further assistance. In addition, the toll-free hotline has become a part of the national communicable disease surveillance system to detect and control any suspected infectious event with the potential of causing outbreaks in Taiwan. We also use it as a monitor or an indicator of the level of anxiety and panic before and during an outbreak.",

For example, people now have easy electronic access to 203 government datasets for information on 14 groups of infectious diseases topics.10 All of this information is easy to read, free to use, in open document format, and free for value-added analysis.",

The doctor believed there was a causal link between the immunization and his son's death. Media coverage of this event prompted more adverse reactions to be reported and triggered a wave of public distrust in vaccine safety and government authorities. This incident eventually brought the vaccination program to a complete stop. No matter how hard health officials tried to explain and reassure, the public remained skeptical about H1N1 vaccination, even after the case's autopsy revealed other likely causes of death. From this incident, Taiwan CDC recognized the importance of communicating with medical professionals and opinion leaders in responding to adverse events when carrying out vaccination campaigns. Since then, Taiwan CDC has held several consultation meetings to exchange opinions on vaccination strategies with these stakeholders. Effort has also been made to constantly update healthcare workers on epidemic situations and infectious disease control strategies and guidelines, so that they are able to help the government prevent and control pandemics.",

The risk communication systems in Taiwan were established and reformed after the SARS outbreak. A closer relationship with the media has been developed according to the WHO principles of building trust, making timely announcements, maintaining transparency, informing but not inflaming the public, and planning in advance. The toll-free hotline has also become a critical component of the national communicable diseases surveillance systems for early detection and timely response to the threat of emerging infectious diseases. Several countries, such as Australia,15 China,16 and Singapore,17 have launched similar call centers. While their call centers cover all healthcare-related emergencies, they are not an integral part of the national surveillance systems to detect and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the risk communication systems in Taiwan have capitalized on new media platforms to communicate with the public since 2009. Digital communication has also helped the Taiwan CDC monitor and verify rumors in response to the 2015 MERS pandemic in South Korea.",
