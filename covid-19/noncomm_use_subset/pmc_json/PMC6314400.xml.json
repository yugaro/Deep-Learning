Our company is focused on gene-based therapies and vaccines and is publically listed on the Korean KOSPI index under the ticker symbol 011000.ks. GeneOne\u2019s focus into biotechnology began in 2005 and was associated with a change in name from Dong-Il Fabric to VGXI International, Inc. The company was re-named as GeneOne Life Science, Inc. in 2014 to better reflect the core mission of the company. GeneOne\u2019s financial HQ and R&D group are based in Seoul, and its global clinical development group is based in Blue Bell, PA, USA. VGXI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GeneOne is based in Woodlands, TX, USA and it is well known as the largest pure-play Contract Manufacturing Organization supplying cGMP grade DNA plasmids, and soon cGMP mRNA, for clinical use.",

In the field of emerging infectious diseases and in response to a major outbreak, GeneOne was able to seamlessly coordinate and navigate the logistical barriers to be able to bring the first Zika vaccine into clinical trials in just 7 months from the start of vaccine design. The speed and remarkable success of the Zika program highlights GeneOne\u2019s internal expertise, strong academic collaborations and commercial partnerships that are critical to product development. GeneOne is one of a small number of companies with a focus on DNA and RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics. GeneOne has two critical differentiators. First is GeneOne\u2019s vertical integration of DNA and mRNA-based therapeutic development from vaccine design and testing through to manufacturing and rapid deployment into clinical practice that allows for seamless transition between developmental areas. Second, is that GeneOne maintains a focus on barriers and challenges at all stages in product development life cycle, encourages innovation and input from all involved, and critically is focused on the end user \u2013 the patients and physicians that are considered partners in development. These aspects allow GeneOne the ability to address unique needs in public health and medical practice.",

The MERS vaccine study was brought forward into clinical trial 9 months from down-selection, a time to clinic that then was considered rapid and was not long after eclipsed by the speed of our Zika vaccine program, as already discussed. The first-in-man phase I studies of the MERS and Zika vaccines have been completed, and a second Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico that started in late summer of 2016 completed study visits in August 2018. Analysis of both the MERS and Zika vaccines showed that immune response was dose independent. For Zika, the passive transfer of serum to immunodeficient mice was protective regardless of the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The latter study was published in the NEJM (Tebas et al., N Engl J Med 2017; doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1708120). GeneOne has continued its focus on emerging infectious diseases making significant progress on its SFTS vaccine. In the DNA-based therapeutics area, our research group demonstrated efficacy of DNA expressed anti-Her2 monoclonal antibody in a xenograft mouse model of human breast cancer \u2013 confirming the utility of this platform.",
