In the early 1990's, international public health and medical care organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), were trying to figure out how to reasonably allocate limited public health and medical care resources. Against this backdrop, voices were raised to find a new methodology to calculate the health level of population groups.12",

            "text": "Around that time, Alan Lopez, WHO, epidemiologist, and Christopher Murray, professor at Harvard School of Public Health, developed the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as an indicator to comprehensively measure the health level of a population group. DALYs consists of the sum of the years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, which refers to the number of years lost as a person dies earlier than life expectancy, and the years lived with disability (YLDs), which refers to the number of healthy years lost due to morbidity or injuries.3 The basic unit for these summary measures is lost years of healthy life. In other words, 1 DALY means that 1 healthy year is lost due to premature death, disease, or disability, and it means that the higher the DALYs, the wider the gap from the ideal health level.4 The WHO and other organizations started using DALYs as the criteria to reasonably allocate resources. In addition, it offered useful information to decision makers, health-sector leaders, researchers, and informed citizens. The most representative burden of disease study calculated with DALYs is the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study that is conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation led by professor Christopher Murray. In the GBD study, researchers collect epidemiological data from previously published literature or statistics to derive the DALYs for each disease in many different countries around the world. In doing so, they borrow the epidemiological data of other countries if there are no available data. Therefore, as for the issues have been raised regarding the reliability and validity of the epidemiological data that are put into calculating DALYs in the GBD study, and researchers are making tremendous efforts to enhance the qualitative level of the input parameters required to calculate DALYs.",

Therefore, efforts have been made since the early 2000s to calculate Korea's burden of disease with our own data sources. In the initial period, most of the Korean burden of disease studies were usually focusing on a single disease such as stroke or mental illness.56 A 2002 study on the burden of disease of Korean people was the first of its kind in Korea and the most recent burden of disease study is based on data from 2012.78 However, because research methodology improved in the period between these two studies, they did not use the same methodology, and the lists of diseases measured were also different from each other. Therefore, it is impossible to make a direct comparison between those studies in terms of changes of burden of disease.",

It is expected that by 2026, Korea will become a super-aged society where the elderly population will make up as much as 20.8% of the total population.15 In Korea, life expectancy has increased by 6.1 years, from 76.0 in 2000 to 82.1 in 2015, but disability adjusted life expectancy increased by only 4.6 years, from 68.1 in 2000 to 72.7 in 2015.1216 In other words, the proportion of the population who are elderly has increased, and the period of living with disease or disability before death has been prolonged. These trends seem to have contributed to the drastic increase in YLDs.",

Improvements in medical technology and increased life expectancy seem to have reduced the burden caused by premature death. In particular, the decrease in deaths from injuries made a significant contribution. Injuries caused by motorized vehicles with three or more wheels fell by 33.9% since 2007, while injuries caused to pedestrians by road vehicles decreased by 30.2%. In the case of self-harm, which comprises the largest portion of YLLs, it rose until 2011 and showed a decreasing trend afterward. In 2015, the YLLs for self-harm fell by 20% compared to the figures from 2011. Rates of self-harm in Korea are the highest among OECD member countries. A variety of policies have been established to prevent deaths from self-harm. Among them, the government-wide \u201ccomprehensive countermeasure for the prevention of suicide\u201d was established in 2007, and the \u201cAct on the Prevention of Suicide\u201d was enacted. However, further research is needed regarding whether the burden of disease caused by self-harm actually decreased or not. This is because while the rates of self-harm caused mortality decreased, the number of suicide attempts, as collected through the National Emergency Department Information System, is still on the rise.19 In the YLDs for self-harm calculated in this study, we only included the cases where people were admitted to hospitals or higher-level medical institutions after making a suicide attempt. Those who used outpatient clinics or visited clinic-level medical institutions were excluded. Such criteria were applied not only to self-harm but also to injuries. Therefore, there are chances that the YLDs of injuries was underestimated. In this regard, it is necessary to calculate the burden of injuries more accurately by reinforcing data sources.",

The burden of disease was particularly high among women in their 30s to 50s and it seems to be caused by environmental characteristics including child-rearing and household chores for which women have the main responsibility, as well as physiological changes such as pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and aging.",

Compared to 2007, the burden of disease in 2015 had increased by 283.8%. It seems that such a huge increase was caused by the increasing number of incidence cases of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias due to the rapid aging of the population and the downward trend of the age at which patients are diagnosed with those diseases. As it costs more and more to treat and care for patients with geriatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and related social expenses rise, the Korean government introduced the long-term care insurance system for the elderly in 2008.21 In order to benefit from the long-term care insurance for the elderly, patients were screened for early stage Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and so the disease burden was rapidly increased. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias show a rapid growth in disease burden, but there is a lack of evidence to support effective interventions to reduce them. Therefore, effective prevention strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias should be established and pursued as targets of public health policy and health promotion projects.",

In the 2010 GBD study, the methodology used to calculate DALYs was changed from the incidence-based approach to the prevalence-based approach. Therefore, it is not appropriate to directly compare the DALYs calculated in the GBD study and the DALYs calculated in this study.23 This study calculated DALYs by applying the incidence-based approach, while the GBD study applied the prevalence-based approach. The incidence-based approach is a method of estimating the loss of health caused by death and disability occurring after the onset of disease and the prevalence-based approach is a method of calculating the loss of health of patients in a given year. The advantage of the incidence-based approach is that it is possible to figure out how much loss of health would arise if a disease or injury occurs, but it is hard to consider the people currently living with the disease. That is, it has limitations in calculating the current burden of disease if the disease has a high prevalence but its incidence is on the decrease. In contrast, with the prevalence-based approach, it is hard to predict how much burden of disease would arise if a disease occurs, but it has the advantage that it is appropriate to calculate the current burden of disease caused by a certain disease.23 It is hard to say which approach is superior, but it seems that calculating DALYs under the prevalence-based approach was developed as a method to overcome the limitations of collecting input parameters that should be collected in every country to calculate the GBD. On the other hand, as more than 97% of the total population in Korea have health insurance or are entitled to medical care assistance, we can see most of the medical service usage data through the National Health Insurance claims data, and it is also easier to calculate incidence of a disease as it is possible to structure the cohort format data with the personal identification code.24 For this reason, this study applied the incidence-based approach to calculate DALYs.",

From the 2015 Korean burden of disease rankings presented in the GBD study, migraine was ranked seventh out of all diseases but was not even included among the top 30 diseases in this study. Generally, migraine is not considered a disease that requires treatment, but it is usually recognized as a symptom that occurs due to stress or lack of sleep. As we intended to set the prevalence criteria of migraine by considering it as a disease in this study, we defined the people with disease as those who visited the outpatient clinic for three times or more for one year with migraine as main diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; code, G43). Under such definition, migraine was classified as a disease with low prevalence in this study. In the GBD study, however, epidemiological indicators that were derived through self-administered survey were used.252627 For this reason, migraine was observed as having high prevalence, and therefore, DALYs calculated by using it was very high.24 As a result, the GBD study results have connotations that the DALYs of the diseases for which self-medication is possible without using medical services, such as headache and gastrointestinal disorder, can be overestimated, while it can be underestimated in the results of this study.",

First, it did not calculate the burden of disease of new types of communicable disease such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, which spread widely across the globe in 2015. Therefore, it is needed to calculate the burden of disease by including diseases that realistically reflect the circumstances of Korea. Another limitation is the methodological limitation related to the calculation of the duration of each disease. This study used DISMOD-2 for diseases and injuries other than communicable diseases.28 However, the estimated duration of chronic disease with long duration, such as diabetes mellitus, calculated shorter than generally known. Duration of disease can vary depending on the public health care environment and the level of development of each nation, but DISMOD-2 does not properly reflect such variations. Therefore, in order to reflect the circumstances of Korea, further research needs to be conducted in the future regarding the methodology needed to derive the duration of diseases. In addition, this study failed to consider the issue of underestimation arising out of excluding the unmet demands for medical services among those who do not use medical services as it only used the data of medical service users. In Korea, however, it is assumed that the size of burden of disease arising out of the failure to consider the unmet demands for medical services is not that large because almost every person is covered by the National Health Insurance. Nonetheless, more consideration needs to be given to the issue of how to reflect the not-used medical services and the unmet demands for medical services in calculating the burden of disease.",
