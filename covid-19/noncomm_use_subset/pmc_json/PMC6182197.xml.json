However, other trials have demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variability in treatment response to ICSs versus LTRAs.456 It is important for a clinician to collect information that better guides them in selecting medication most likely to achieve a favorable response in each patient (i.e., tailor-made treatment regimens).",

The recognition of a high EDN/HDM-sensitive phenotype that exhibits a favorable response to standard asthma treatments is important. Of the 100 patients screened for eligibility, nearly half (43%) were found to be of this phenotype, which is considerable. The elevated levels of EDN and other eosinophil degranulation products found in symptomatic asthma would suggest airway inflammation is characterized not only by an increase in the number of eosinophils, but also an increase in airway eosinophil degranulation.16 Therefore, it has been suggested that the secretory activity of eosinophils \u2014 a combination of concentration of eosinophils and their propensity to release degranulation products \u2014 may be a key marker for disease activity and is more accurately assessed by eosinophil degranulation products such as EDN.17 EDN is released almost exclusively by eosinophils18; therefore, any change in EDN levels would be a direct reflection of changes in eosinophilic inflammation. Significant changes in EDN levels between disease phases have been noted in previous studies.1219 EDN may therefore be useful in predicting therapeutic outcomes and is a welcome addition to a clinician's ability to effectively treat and monitor asthma. This was further demonstrated in our study as montelukast treatment significantly reduced elevated EDN levels in the MONT group, which has also been shown in other asthma studies12 and even in patients with post-RSV bronchiolitis recurrent wheeze.20 Among the subjects excluded from the main study group (OBS group), the subgroup with no HDM sensitivity but elevated EDN experienced a reduction in their EDN levels as well. Montelukast was the chosen treatment for the OBS group because it has been reported that ICS is less effective in non-atopic populations.21 Furthermore, from our clinical experience montelukast is preferred over ICS by both physicians and patients in Korea and Japan.",

It is known that eosinophils release EDN and other degranulation products when activated; in particular, peripheral blood eosinophils were found to release approximately 17%-28% of their total intracellular EDN.24 Furthermore, Sedgwick et al.24 demonstrated that intracellular EDN is also increased in asthmatic patients, while ECP is not. Montelukast is an LTRA, capable of binding with cysteine leukotriene (cysLT) receptors expressed on eosinophils and disrupting their autocrine release. CysLTs can induce eosinophil degranulation,25 which then leads to release of a number of mediators including EDN, ECP and cysLTs.26 This may explain the reduction in EDN levels in the MONT group and in patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels. Corticosteroid treatment may or may not eliminate cytokine-primed, EDN-increased and longer-surviving eosinophils resulting in decreased EDN levels.12 We observed no significant decrease in EDN levels after budesonide treatment in our study, which was contrary to our initial hypothesis that budesonide would also reduce EDN levels. This may be because budesonide, an ICS, acts locally, whereas montelukast acts systemically. Eosinophils develop principally in the bone marrow and are recruited from the circulation, where they migrate to inflammatory sites, such as the airways, and then participate in immunologic processes.26 Once activated, the eosinophil releases EDN and other granular proteins. Changes in granular protein levels signal changes in the turnover and activity of the eosinophil. Taken together, eosinophil production, recruitment and activation are a systemic process.",

Tailoring patient treatment based on the direct and objective measurement of airway inflammation resulted in significantly less frequent and severe asthma exacerbations and, consequently a trend towards fewer asthma-related hospital admissions.28 Knowing both the inflammatory profile and the clinical categorization of the patient develops a clearer phenotype of the asthma patient and appears to contribute to improved asthma care.2731 Using a more accurate biomarker for eosinophilic inflammation in the management of asthma may produce even better results.3233 It has been suggested by many studies that EDN is a more accurate biomarker than eosinophil numbers or percentages.11122232 Future studies of EDN as a biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of conditions associated with airway inflammation \u2014 such as recurrent wheeze, multiple-trigger wheeze and asthma \u2014 are needed.",
