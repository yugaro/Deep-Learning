Approximately 85% of the patients with KD are under 5 years of age.2,3 The occurrence of KD is rare in adolescents and adults.4 The specific cause of KD is still unclear, but some reports suggest that it is triggered by bacterial or viral infections.5\u20137 Herein, we describe a rare case of adult-onset KD which revealed to be concurrently infected by Coxsackievirus A4.",

All principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki were followed. A 37-year-old, previously healthy Japanese man was admitted to our hospital 12 days after he developed a fever of 38\u00b0C and erythema of the hands, arms, and legs. Concurrently, he developed swollen and painful fingers. Two days later, he consulted the outpatient department because of fever. He was treated with 300 mg/day of cefcapene-pivoxil and 60 mg/day of loxoprofen, but his condition did not improve. Seven days before admission to our hospital, he was admitted to another hospital for examination of the cause of the fever and erythema in the neck, abdomen, back, and legs. The laboratory test results in the previous hospital included total bilirubin of 3.58 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 48 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 61 U/L, \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase of 116 U/L, blood nitrogen urea of 45 mg/dL, and creatinine of 3.45 mg/dL, indicating liver and kidney dysfunction. On the 2nd day in the previous hospital, he developed conjunctival congestion. On day 5, desquamation of the hands, fingers, and toes was noted. He was eventually referred to our hospital for close examination and treatment.",

His temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, blood pressure was 136/84 mmHg, pulse rate was regular at 88 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute. Physical examination showed desquamation around the lips (Figure 1A), fingers (Figure 1B), and feet (Figure 1C). Edematous erythema was noted on his trunk, extremities, axillae, flank, and hip. There was also brawny edema of the hands and feet and marked congestion of the conjunctivae (Figure 1D). His lips were reddish, dry, and swollen. His palatine tonsils were also slightly red. The cervical lymph nodes were not enlarged. The chest was clear to auscultation. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. No arthritis was noted, and neurological examination also yielded normal results. Laboratory data on admission revealed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis, and serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and C-reactive protein levels were elevated (Table 1). Repeat blood culture was sterile. Rapid test for Streptococcus pyogenes antigen was negative. The presence of antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus indicated past infections (Table 2). Chest radiography showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed hepatic and splenic enlargement and fatty liver. A skin biopsy of the erythema on the left forearm showed lymphocyte infiltrations around vessels in the superficial layer of the epidermis. There were no findings suspected for vasculitis or drug allergy. The patient had fever for >5 days, and four additional principal signs indicative of KD based on the diagnostic criteria defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,8 namely exanthema, change in peripheral extremities, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, and changes in the oropharynx, on the basis of which he was clinically diagnosed with KD. On the day of admission, he was treated with 2,700 mg/day of oral aspirin (30 mg/kg/day). On day 4, the dose of aspirin was reduced to 450 mg/day (5 mg/kg/day) because of defervescence; however, on day 5, the patient developed liver dysfunction as an adverse effect of aspirin. After day 6 in our hospital, the myalgia, congested conjunctivae, erythema, and desquamations were found to be gradually resolving. By day 13, the erythema and desquamation were completely resolved. However, the treatment was switched from aspirin to 200 mg/day of cilostazol because the alanine aminotransferase levels increased to 150 U/L (Figure 2). Subsequently, the liver function normalized, and the patient was discharged on the 13th hospital day. During hospitalization, transthoracic echocardiography disclosed no coronary aneurysms. At follow-up, coronary computed tomography performed 2 months after the onset of the disease revealed no coronary aneurysms (Figure 3).",

Children under 5 years of age constitute 88.5% of reported cases.2,3 KD occurs predominantly in children while rarely in adolescents and adults.4 The oldest reported case was that of a 68-year-old Caucasian man from France in 2005.9 The diagnostic criteria for KD as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include unexplained fever lasting 5 days or more and at least four out of the five following criteria: 1) polymorphic exanthema; 2) changes in the peripheral extremities, that is, erythema and/or indurative edema of the palms and soles (acute phase) or desquamation around the finger tips (convalescent phase); 3) bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection; 4) changes in the oropharynx, that is, injected or fissured lips, strawberry tongue, and injected pharynx; and 5) acute nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm in diameter). Patients with fewer than four of these clinical signs can be diagnosed as having atypical KD if coronary artery abnormalities are present.8 Additionally, it is necessary to exclude the possibility of other diseases that cause fever and rash (eg, toxic shock syndrome, streptococcal scarlet fever, measles, other viral infections, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome, or a drug reaction).",

We analyzed serum samples taken on days 5, 13, and 32 of illness for antibody titers of Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and echovirus. The day 5 serum sample was taken from the previous hospital. The antibody titer of only Coxsackievirus A4 was increased fourfold on day 13 as compared to day 5 and was decreased on day 32. This strongly suggests that the Coxsackievirus infection was present when KD occurred. Coxsackievirus A4 is a member of the Picornaviridae family of viruses in the Enterovirus genus. It can be a cause of herpangina and myocarditis. Rigante et al reported the cases of Kawasaki syndrome and concurrent Coxsackievirus B3 infection.13 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of KD cases and concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection thus far. There are various types of adenovirus and Coxsackievirus, and tests for proving these common viral infections (eg, serological antibody, polymerase chain reaction) are performed in few cases. Therefore, such coinfections remain undiagnosed and are thus likely unreported.",

There are three essential treatments for KD: 1) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to obtain an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) aspirin for anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects, and 3) management of any complications (eg, meningitis or disseminated intravascular coagulation). IVIG can mitigate inflammation and the coronary artery complications. A dose of 2 g/kg of IVIG in a single infusion has been found to be effective. This therapy should be initiated within the first 10 days of illness.14,15 IVIG has not been demonstrated to be effective if administered after the first 10 days of illness. Furthermore, one report has noted a risk of unfavorable effects with IVIG regarding cardiac sequelae if IVIG is started on day 9 or later.16 In our patient, IVIG was not administered because he was admitted to our hospital on the 13th day of illness.",
