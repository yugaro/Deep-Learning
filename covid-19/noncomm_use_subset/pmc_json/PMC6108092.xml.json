Measurement of central cornea thickness (CCT)\nusing optical low coherence reflectometer of the mouse (Balb/c) and rat (Wistar) were\napproximately 106 and 159 \u00b5m, respectively (Schulz et al. 2003). However, by histology, CCT for\nthe mouse has been reported to range from ~122\u2013160 \u00b5m (Henriksson et al. 2009; Rodriguez-Ramos Fernandez and\nDubielzig 2013), and ~250 \u00b5m for the hooded rat (Massof and Chang 1972).",

In\nrodents, the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% (in contrast to other\nspecies, including humans, where the epithelium is approximately 10%) of the total\ncorneal thickness (Henriksson et\nal. 2009). The epithelium is arranged in three distinct layers: superficial\nlayer of flattened non-keratinized squamous cells; middle layer of polyhedral wing\ncells; and basal cells. The epithelium of the rodent cornea undergoes post-natal\ndevelopment and cell differentiation, with 1-2 cell layers present at birth, to 4-5\ncell layers at eyelid opening, to 6-7 layers in the adult (Chung et al. 1992), although some sources put the\nupper limits at the central cornea closer to thirteen layers (Henriksson et al. 2009). Epithelial cells appear\nto derive from the basal cells of the entire cornea during early development (Chung et al. 1992; Zieske 2004). Following maturation stem\ncells are localized to the limbus similar to other species and are the source of\nepithelial cell replenishment during cell turnover, which is continuous, or\nrecruitment following corneal injury. The integrity and function of the cornea are\ndependent on the division of epithelial stem cells, and the amplification and\ncentripetal migration of the daughter cells into the cornea to populate the basal\nepithelium (Secker and Daniels\n2009). As the cells differentiate they move horizontally towards the surface,\nbecoming first, polyhedral suprabasal wing cells, and second, flat squamous cells at\nthe surface, where they eventually (induced by blinking) desquamate into the tear\nfilm. The superficial squamous cells have microvilli that function to increase the\ncell surface and promote tear adherence (Secker and Daniels 2009).",

The anterior border is formed by a discontinuous band of fibroblasts\nand melanocytes. The stroma is loosely arranged and composed of collagen fibrils,\nfibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and a network of nerve fibers and blood vessels.

The pupil is generally round in the rodent.\nThe major arterial circle of the iris is furnished by anastomoses of the anterior\nciliary arteries and the long posterior arteries (Riordan-Eva 2011). Stromal blood vessels are\nrelatively thick, and allow for constant blood flow regardless of pupil constriction\nor dilation (Barskey 2006).

Lens epithelial cells form a\nmonolayer sheath on the anterior surface, and secrete an extracellular protein matrix\nforming a capsule that surrounds the cellular elements. Posterior lens fibers are\nelongated, transparent, fully differentiated cells that derive from progenitor\nepithelial cells. Cell proliferation is restricted to progenitor epithelial cells\nlocated in the germinative layer above the lens equator (nuclear bow). Under the\ninfluence of fibroblast growth factors, progeny cells migrate, or shift posterior to\nthe equator, where they differentiate into fiber cells. As the cells differentiate,\nthey undergo bi-directional elongation and produce massive quantities of crystalline\nproteins that are arranged in complex matrices along thin filaments that compose the\ncytoskeleton of the fiber cell (Zampighi et al. 2011). Crytallines have a critical role in maintaining lens\ntransparency and refractive properties. Injury to the lens may result in the formation\nof insoluble aggregates of crystallines, producing opacities (correlating to\nophthalmically observable cataracts) that obstruct light transmission and obscure\nvision. As elongation progresses, the fibers become convex, and the apical tips\nmigrate towards the anterior pole. The lens increases in size and weight as more\nfibers are successively incorporated into layers to form the lens mass. Older fibers\n(primary fibers) form the embryonic nucleus of the lens while the newer (secondary)\nfibers form the outer layers. Lens fibers subsequently undergo organelle degradation\nincluding nuclear loss (Dawes et al.\n2014; Song et al.\n2014).",

The cortical\nvitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary\nvitreous). The cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared\nto the medullary vitreous, and has the appearance of a smooth clear membrane due to\nthe lamellar distribution of collagen fibrils and associated highly polymerized\nproteoglycans (primarily chondroitin sulfate). Although the cortical vitreous\nrepresents only 2% of the total vitreous volume, it is the metabolic center of the\nvitreous body, because it contains the hyalocytes (detailed below), which make up 90%\nof the cell population in the cortical vitreous; fibrocytes and glial cells make up\nthe remaining 10%. The vitreous cortex extends anteriorly from the vitreous base to\nform the anterior vitreous cortex and posteriorly to form the posterior vitreous\ncortex. The vitreous body interfaces with a number of ocular structures through the\nvitreous cortex. The anterior vitreous cortex forms the posterior limits of the\nposterior chamber and functions in the physiologic communication between the vitreous\ncavity and the aqueous humor. The anterior surface of the vitreous body extends\nanterior and medially from the pars plana at the ora ciliaris to contact the lens\nposterior to the lens equator. Thus, the anterior vitreous cortex is in contact with\nthe ciliary processes and the lens zonules, as well as the posterior lens capsule. The\nvitreous attaches to the lens capsule in a ring-like manner, forming the ligament of\nWieger (Sebag 1992). Posterior to the\nora ciliaris, bundles of vitreous fibrils attach to the internal limiting laminae\n(ILL) (Balazs et al. 1964).\nCords of vitreous collagen insert into gaps between the neuroglia. The cortical\nvitreous is most firmly attached to the ILL in the area of the optic disc, the macula\n(in primates), and to retinal blood vessels. Retinal pathology such as\nneovascularization or vascular malformations occurs in the areas of vitreous\nattachment to the retina. Separation of the vitreous may transmit traction to these\nattachments, leading to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal tears. Persistent vitreous\ntraction on retinal tears is an important factor in the development of a retinal\ndetachment.",

Bipolar cells have two processes that separately extend\ninward and outward connecting to ganglion cells and photoreceptors. Bipolar cells\nreceive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) and\ntransmit signals to ganglion cells. Horizontal cells are less frequent and often lie\nin the outer part of INL. These GABAergic inhibitory interneurons help integrate and\nregulate the input from multiple photoreceptor cells, optimizing vision under both\nbright and dim light conditions. Amacrine cells are numerous and often lie in the\ninner aspect of the INL. These are also inhibitory interneurons that interact with\nbipolar cells and ganglion cells to regulate neuronal impulses allowing one area of\nthe retina to influence the activity of another. M\u00fcller cells are specialized glial\ncells that provide structural and functional support to the retina. These cells also\nmaintain the stability of the retinal extracellular environment through the uptake\nof neurotransmitters, removal of cellular debris, and storage of glycogen for\nenergy. Their nuclei are located in the INL and their long processes stretch\nradially across the thickness of the retina contacting the outer and inner limiting\nmembranes. M\u00fcller cells have a close spatial relationship to pericytes of the\nretinal blood vessels and contribute to the maintenance of the blood-retinal\nbarrier. Cells in the INL can be quantified and identified by special stains (Jeon et al. 1998).",

The RPE and retina originate from different portions\nof the optic vesicle during embryonic development and are attached by an extracellular\nmatrix specialized to enable interaction between the RPE and POS. Retinal disease or\ntoxicological insult may result in loss of adhesion between the retina and RPE,\nresulting in retinal detachment and formation of a subretinal space (Mecklenburg and Schraermeyer\n2007). Pathological retinal detachment must be differentiated from artifact\ndetachment, which is readily induced during processing of ocular tissues. RPE has\ncritical roles in the support and viability of the photoreceptors with functions that\ninclude absorption of stray light, adhesion of the sensory retina to the choroid,\nsecretion of growth factors, maintenance of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM),\nphotoreceptor membrane turnover, and retinoid metabolism (Bok 1993; Marmor\n1998). The apical membrane of RPE cells have numerous, long microvilli that\ninterdigitate with the outer segments of the photoreceptors, allowing for efficient\nturnover of discs as they are shed from the photoreceptors. The accumulation of\ninclusion bodies (see lysosomal accumulations, below) containing photoreceptor outer\nsegment membranes can be observed in aging RPE and are associated with RPE\ndegeneration that can lead to blindness (Marmor 1998). The basal membrane of the RPE has large infoldings and an\nassociation with Bruch\u2019s membrane. Tight junctions between RPE form an important\ncomponent of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) necessary for the maintenance of immune\ndeviation in the posterior segment of the eye. They also prevent leakage of blood\nconstituents from the choriocapillaris, and create osmotic pressure that assists in\ndrawing fluid out of the retina through cellular mechanisms. Transcellular movement of\nglucose, retinol, amino acids and other nutrients into the retina, and that of\nmetabolic wastes out, is regulated by receptors, ion channels and exchangers, and\ncytoplasmic organelles. These have a polar distribution in RPE, and the regulated\nmovement of ions through the cell and IPM creates ionic gradients that maintain\nphotoreceptor excitability and permits electrical transmission of light stimulus\n(Hughs 1998).",

            "text": "Outer retinal atrophy or degeneration is a broad term that indicates loss of\nphotoreceptors from a variety of causes that include hereditary, aging, toxicity,\nphototoxicity, nutritional deficiencies, retinal detachment, and inflammation.\nPhotoreceptors have high metabolic demands, and thus are susceptible to toxins\nthat interfere with energy metabolism, e.g. nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase\n(NAMPT) inhibitors (Zabka, Singh et\nal. 2015). Genetic forms of atrophy occur in several strains of mice,\nincluding several mutant and transgenic mouse strains and rats. Ocular screening\nshould be conducted prior to study inclusion and animals exhibiting atrophy\nremoved, or equally distributed amongst dose groups. Photoreceptor degeneration\nmay occur with remarkable sparing of the inner retinal layers and RPE. Outer\nretinal atrophy in rodents is characteristic of senile retinal degeneration, which\nhas a tendency to begin at the peripheral retina (Hockwin, Green et al. 1992). Light-induced\nretinal atrophy/degeneration (usually RPE cells are not affected) occurs in albino\nrodents and is caused by prolonged exposure to light or exposure to high intensity\nlight. These lighting conditions may occur if animals are kept in cages on the top\nof racks close to the room light source (De Vera Mudry, Kronenberg et al. 2013).\nIn contrast, focal atrophy of outer retinal segments following choroidal circular\ndisturbance is always associated with loss of regional RPE cells (Tanaka, Inagaki et al.\n1993).",

The most widely accepted theory is that iERM is a consequence of surface\nbreaks in the ILM of the retina and forms within the cortical vitreous, which\nserves as the structural component and provides a medium upon which glial cells\nand hyalocytes can proliferate.

A small superior arm is connected to a large inferior arm by a\nnarrow band medial to the optic nerve. The color of the gland varies from pink to dark\ngrey depending upon the abundance and characteristics of melanocytes in the capsule and\ninterlobar septa (Markert and\nSilvers 1956). In addition, in rodents the gland is speckled with a pigment\nidentified as a porphyrin that fluoresces under ultraviolet light, which is secreted by\nthe gland, and the amount is said to vary with strain, sex, and age (Figge and Davidheiser 1957).\nThe tubuloalveolar gland is covered by a delicate connective tissue capsule bound\nloosely to the orbital fascia. Strands from the capsule divide the gland into lobes and\nlobules. The epithelial cells are pyramidal, their height depending upon the secretory\nphase. A round nucleus containing two or three nucleoli is located near the base, and\nthe cytoplasm, packed with lipid droplets, appears finely vacuolated or foamy.\nMyoepithelial cells are present between the epithelial cells and the prominent basement\nmembrane (Chiquoine 1958). The primary\nglandular secretion are lipids (wax esters), secreted by exocytosis (merocrine-type\nexcretion) and yellow-brown porphyrin pigment, which is not visualized within the\ncytoplasm but in the acinar and ductal lumina. The ducts are lined by cuboidal\nepithelium. Alveolar, lobular, and lobar ducts join to form a single excretory duct,\nwhich opens at the base of the nictitating membrane.",

The extraorbital gland of the rat is bean\nshaped (12 \u00d7 9 mm) and flat (2 mm thick), whereas the intraorbital gland has an\napproximate triangular form (major axis of 7.5 mm and 1 mm thickness) (Hebel and Stromberg 1986). In\nthe mouse, the extraorbital gland is approximately 3 mm in diameter and the intraorbital\ngland can be hardly visualized without magnification (Botts et al. 1999). The excretory ducts of both glands\nfuse to form a common duct at the temporal angle of the palpebral fissure which opens\ninto the conjunctival sac dorsally. Both lacrimal glands are tubuloacinar and\nhistologically identical. Each is enclosed in a connective tissue capsule and divided by\nconnective tissue septa into lobes and lobules. The serous secretory cells are pyramidal\nwith granular basophilic cytoplasm that stains intensely near the round, basally-located\nnuclei, and stains much less intensely between the nuclei and the narrow acinar lumen.\nMyoepithelial cells are found between the epithelium and the basement membrane. The\nintralobular ducts are lined by cuboidal cells whereas the excretory ducts are lined by\nstratified columnar epithelium (Krinke et\nal. 1994; 1996).\nHistologically, a gender dimorphism of the lacrimal glands can be observed after sexual\nmaturity in rats, which increases with age and is characterized by scattered enlarged\nacinar epithelial cells containing enlarged nuclei (karyomegaly) in the male. In female\nrats, the lacrimal gland maintains the normal histological structure with aging, in\nmales the lacrimal gland becomes pleomorphic (see Karyomegaly and Harderian gland\nalteration).",

            "text": "The paired nasolacrimal ducts are the major component of a draining system that carries\nthe lacrimal secretions from the eyes to the nasal cavity. Due to this anatomical and\nfunctional relation with the eye and glands of the eye, it is considered to be part of\nthe lacrimal apparatus. The draining system begins with the lacrimal ducts at two puncta\nlacrimalia in each eye, oval openings located close to the edge of the eyelids lateral\nto the nasal angle of the palpebral fissure. The lacrimal ducts fuse nasally to form the\nnasolacrimal duct. In the rat, the paired nasolacrimal ducts are about 22 mm long, 0.5\nby 0.2 mm wide in the initial portion and about 0.8 by 0.6 mm in its middle portion.\nEach nasolacrimal duct as a membranous tube runs along the outer aspect of the lacrimal\nbone, passes through the infraorbital fissure, and enters the osseous nasolacrimal\ncanal, which crosses the alveolus of the incisor tooth ventrally. Within the region of\nthe nasal cavity it runs in a channel formed by a ventral lamella of the\nmaxilloturbinate and the os incisivum. At the rostral end of the maxilloturbinate it\npasses to the lateral wall of the nasal cartilage and about 2 mm caudal to the nostril\nopens ventromedially into the nasal vestibule (Hebel and Stromberg 1986). Since the\nnasolacrimal duct is visualized when examining the nasal cavity at different section\nlevels, this duct has been referred to as part of the upper respiratory system, or as an\naccessory structure of the nasal cavity. Depending on the section level of the nasal\ncavity examined, the nasolacrimal duct can be found dorsolateral to the maxillary sinus\nat level III (section through the second palatine crest including the first upper molars\nin the rat); laterally to the root of the incisor tooth at the level II (section at the\nincisive papilla in rat and mice) or ventromedial to the root of the incisor teeth at\nlevel I (section at the posterior part of the upper incisor teeth in rat and mice)\n(Monticello et al. 1990;\nBoorman et al. 1990; Uraih and Maronpot 1990; Kittel et al. 2004).The epithelium of\nthe ducts in the mouse varies from slightly keratinized squamous or low cuboidal in\nlevels I and II of the nasal cavity, to non-ciliated pseudostratified cuboidal or\ncolumnar epithelium in level III (Herbert and Leininger 1999). According to other authors, stratified squamous\nepithelium is found at the origin and termination of the nasolacrimal duct. The rest of\nthe duct is lined by pseudostratified non-ciliated columnar epithelium (Uraih and Maronpot 1990).\nFurthermore, the nasolacrimal duct epithelium has been described as a transitional\nepithelium (Stewart et al. 1979).\nDetailed descriptions of the mentioned epithelial types are missing. At level III of the\nnasal cavity, subepithelial lymphoid cell infiltrates appear to be associated to the\ninitial part of the nasolacrimal duct (Monticello et al. 1990).",

MOE regenerates from\nbasal cells, Bowman\u2019s glands (epithelial or in the submucosa) and duct cells regenerate\nfrom progenitor cells within the ducts, whereas sustentacular cells can arise from both\ncell sources (Huard et al. 1998).\nHowever, a certain specificity of odorant perception may not always be restored unless a\nsubstantial number of fibers of the same type are spared (Schwob 2002).",

The lumina are\nlined laterally by respiratory epithelium and medially by neuronal epithelium (Figure 81). Like other olfactory epithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular\ncells. At present, VNO is the only olfactory organ known to connect with the accessory\nolfactory bulb (Storan and Key\n2006). A low number of neutrophils appear to be normal constituents of the\nnon-sensory, respiratory epithelium (Getchell and Kulkarni 1995; D\u00f8ving and Trotier 1998). The\nneuronal epithelium is organized into different zones: the marginal zones at the\ntransition/border with the respiratory epithelium; the intermediate zones and the\ncentral zone (Brann and Firestein\n2010). Vomeronasal glands are found apically of the tubules, within the\ncartilage that surrounds the VNO (Adams\n1992). Its main function is perception of pheromones. VNO is already\nwell-developed at birth (Oikawa et al.\n2001), but increases in size postnatally. The overall volume, neuroepithelial\nvolume, and number of bipolar neurons are larger in males compared to females (Guillam\u00f3n and Segovia 1997).\nMitosis in the adult occurs particularly at the marginal zones of the neural epithelium\n(Weiler 2005; De La Rosa-Prieto et al. 2009; Mart\u00ednez-Marcos et al. 2000).\nNeural turnover in the mouse in the VNO epithelium may occur especially through\nmigration (Halpern and\nMart\u00ednez-Marcos 2003); cells at the edges were found to migrate horizontally\nvery slowly (less than 10% of the distance from the edge to the center of the epithelium\nper month). Distribution of apoptotic cells indicate that a number of cells in mitosis\ndie before becoming functional neurons. Regeneration of new neurons is preserved even in\naged rodents (De La\nRosa-Prieto et al. 2010).",

Like other olfactory\nepithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular cells. The SOM is located\nrostral to the MOE and may serve as a rostral sensor in advance of MOE perception,\ntriggering deeper inhalation (Marshall and Maruniak 1986). Alternatively, SOM olfactory perception may be\nlimited to certain chemical signatures dictated by the limited connection to specific\nregions within the olfactory bulb. SOM projects mainly to the posterior, ventromedial\npart of the main olfactory bulb (Ma et al.\n2003). Both options are supported by molecular analysis of the receptors\npresent in SOM (Tian and Ma 2004;\nSu et al. 2009). The sensory neurons\nin the septal organ and in the MOE share signaling pathways and show similar odorant\nresponses, but some receptors are present in SOM in very high densities. The SOM can\nserve as an airflow sensor in addition to its chemosensory roles (Ma 2010).",

The main olfactory bulb is\norganized into a glomerular layer, external plexiform layer, mitral cell layer, internal\nplexiform layer and a granule cell layer (Gutman et al. 2013). The glomerular layer receives direct input from the\nolfactory nerve, and their axons terminate in spherical structures known as glomeruli,\nwhere they connect in the external plexiform layer with the apical dendrites of mitral\ncells. The basal dendrites (internal plexiform layer) of the mitral cells transport the\nsignals further to the olfactory cortex. Mitral cells are connected to interneurons\nknown as granule cells, which are probably involved in inhibition processes. The\naccessory olfactory bulb, a region located dorsal-posterior to the main olfactory bulb,\nappears to operate independently from the main olfactory bulb (Yokosuka 2012). It receives input from the vomeronasal\norgan and connects mainly to the amygdala and hypothalamus (Mucignat-Caretta 2010).",

Even if SOM is potentially included, \u2018Metaplasia, respiratory cell\u2019, will\noften go unnoticed, because of similarity with surrounding tissue. Even changes like\nnecrosis/ulceration can go unnoticed or ascribed to respiratory epithelium, especially\nin cases where the change is not restricted to SOM (see Figure, normal anatomy, Septal\nOrgan of Masera) but includes/affects surrounding respiratory epithelium as well.",

Whether tumors arising from olfactory epithelium are more\nappropriately classified under the term neuroepithelial carcinoma or olfactory\nneuroblastoma cannot be resolved on the basis of current information, and they are\nconsidered synonyms in this manuscript. The general term neuroepithelial carcinoma\nis used here because it allows for origin of neoplasms from sensory or\nsustentacular cells, whereas olfactory neuroblastoma implies origin only from\nneurogenic components. There is clearly a need to develop procedures to\ndistinguish neuroepithelial tumors of neurogenic origin (neuroblastoma,\nesthesioneuroblastoma), from those of nonneurogenic cell types, especially\nsustentacular cells and their precursors. When neither rosettes (true or pseudo)\nnor plexiform intercellular fibrils are demonstrable, a diagnosis of\nadenocarcinoma is preferable.

The histogenic relationship of\nBowman\u2019s glands to the other components of the nasal epithelium has not been\nclearly defined, but their origin is most likely not neurogenic.

The stria vascularis consists of three layers of cells, marginal cells,\nintermediate cells, and basal cells. The marginal cells have apical tight junctions,\nadherens junctions, and desmosomes, and are atypical for epithelial cells in that they\nlack a basement membrane. The marginal cells have membrane ion pumps and channels; in\nparticular, they pump Na+ out of the endolymph via\nNa+/K+-ATPases. Intermediate cells contain melanin, are derived from\nthe neural crest, and are sometimes referred to as melanocytes. Basal cells are adjacent\nto the more laterally located spiral ligament. These flat cells form a continuous layer.\nThey also have a dense network of junctional complexes, but lack\nNa+/K+-ATPases. Embedded within the stria vascularis is a\nprominent capillary bed. The stria vascularis is an important component of the\nblood-labyrinth barrier. The spiral ligament is a fibrous cushion located between the\nstria vascularis and the bony otic capsule. This ligament is primarily composed of\nconnective tissue, especially extracellular matrix and cells of mesodermal origin. The\nbasilar membrane is anchored laterally by the spiral ligament, and this anchoring may not\nbe passive in that the ligament contains tension fibroblasts. These cells have contractile\nproteins and may either generate or regulate the tension of the basilar membrane.",
