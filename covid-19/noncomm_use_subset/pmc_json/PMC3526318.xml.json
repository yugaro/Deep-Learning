Precise characterization of population structure (and rare sub-populations) in these studies is fundamental to the analysis of population evolution and dynamics as a function of host response or drug exposure.

RNA viruses have high mutation rates (due to poor or missing proof-reading capability of the viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) and high replication rates, and the resulting intra-host variations have implications for drug treatment strategies (25) and the genetic monitoring of live vaccines (26). The methods used in these studies though rely on ad hoc trimming, filtering and thresholds to call variants, limiting their sensitivity and widespread applicability (needing manual adjustment per sample or sequencing run). Recent model-based approaches such as Breseq (27,28) and SNVer (29) are potentially more sensitive and generic, but rely on simple binomial models and are not tailored to accommodate biases in error rates. A more sophisticated approach, that relies on phasing to reduce the effect of sequencing errors and is tailored to 454 sequencing has recently been applied to viral datasets (30). This method is, however, not directly applicable to other technologies and cannot be run on large genomes or sequencing datasets.",

On the one hand, increased sensitivity in variant callers can make it possible to monitor rare but important sub-populations (e.g. cancer stem cell mutations) and on the other hand, sensitivity is essential for early detection of say a drug-resistant sub-population (e.g. with antiretroviral drugs for HIV). In such settings, ad hoc approaches lack the desired adaptability and robustness and may suffer from an artificial cap in the sensitivity of variant detection. Precise modeling of sequencing errors is essential to push sensitivity limits and it is this need that we seek to address.",

We show that rigorous statistical testing can be done efficiently under this model, without resorting to approximations, thus allowing for the exact analysis of large genomes and high-coverage datasets. The resulting method, LoFreq, adapts automatically to sequencing run and position-specific sequencing biases and can call SNVs at a frequency lower than the average sequencing error rate in a dataset. LoFreq\u2019s robustness, sensitivity and specificity were validated using several simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human) and on two experimental platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom). Our results from applying LoFreq to call rare somatic SNVs (in exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer) and for studying dengue virus quasi species before and after treatment in a clinical study (of a nucleoside-analog drug Balapiravir) further highlight the robustness and versatility of this approach.",

Assays for the sequence variants were designed in multiplex and the genotyping step comprises an initial PCR reaction to amplify the viral genomic region of interest followed by primer extension based on viral genotype status. The size of the extended products thus represents viral genotype status and was then resolved by mass spectrometry time of flight. In total, 18 clinical samples and 4 cell-culture samples (all DENV2) were assayed in two replicates at 79 and 13 positions, respectively (1474 primer/sample combinations).

In particular, it is easy to show that Prn(X=k)=0 for k>n and that entries for n>N \u2212 K, k<K \u2212 N + n do not affect the final P-value. Also, for a given threshold (t) on the P-value, if \u2211k\u2265K Prn(X=k)>t for any n, then the P-value will also be greater than t (as shown below) allowing for computation to terminate prematurely for most columns in an alignment (the non-variant columns).

Quality calibration, as described in (15) can also be used to further refine these values and reduce bias. For variant bases, a user-defined threshold T (default Q20 or 1% error rate) was used to conservatively remove bases with quality below the threshold and variant bases were assigned a quality of T. In the absence of user-provided quality values, LoFreq models error rates for all 12 possible base substitution classes (PX>Y, X \u2260 Y) and estimates them using an Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) approach (34). For this, each column (C) was assumed to come from one of two models, either a reference base with a 12-parameter model for sequencing error (R) or a variant column (V, i.e. ZC \u2208 {R,V}). During the training phase, error probabilities for all substitution classes are learnt directly from the data: the expectation step calls SNVs using a binomial test (Bonferroni-corrected P-value < 0.05) with the current error probabilities and the maximization step updates the error probabilities based on base counts in columns in which the respective substitution class was not called a SNV (i.e. , where b(C) is the reference base in column C and nCY is the number of Y bases seen in column C; this assignment can be shown to maximize the likelihood function). The maximization and expectation steps are iterated until error probabilities converge (<10\u22129). For final SNV calling, the expectation step was used with the converged error probabilities.

These datasets allowed us to investigate the performance of the various methods as a function of sequencing coverage (from 50\u00d7 to 10 000\u00d7). Overall, the heuristic approaches performed poorly in terms of sensitivity (Goto et al.) or PPV (Wright et al.), while all the model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq and LoFreq) had perfect PPV and therefore perfect specificity (Table 1). LoFreq was also the most sensitive method with perfect specificity and called 96% of variants at 0.2% frequency with 10 000\u00d7 coverage (compared with 0 and 8% for SNVer and Breseq, respectively). As expected, with lower coverage, sensitivity fell for all methods but LoFreq continued to improve on results from SNVer and Breseq. These results highlight the utility of the quality-aware approach in LoFreq for being able to exploit information present in high-coverage sequencing datasets to call variants with high sensitivity and specificity.\n",

In particular, results from a samtools analysis of 14 exome sequencing datasets for gastric tumor/normal paired samples from Zang et al.

(32) analyzed earlier. Heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations (present in only a fraction of the mtDNA) are often disease related and have been associated with tumor activity and cancer etiology (42,43). In particular, we identified two low-frequency somatic SNVs (3628:A>C at 8% and 12868:G>A at 10%) in NADH dehydrogenases 1 and 5 in patient NGC0092 which were non-synonymous and not listed in Mitomap (44). Somatic mtDNA mutations have been seen in a diverse set of cancers (45) and mutations in the NADH dehydrogenases, with their role in oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria (46), could potentially play an important role. Analogously, we identified one somatic SNV (8300:T>C at 25%) in the tRNA (Lys) gene in patient NGC0082, a known hotspot for mtDNA mutations and with several variants associated with myopathies (including one at position 8303 (47,48)). Rare heteroplasmic variations have previously been studied with targeted re-sequencing, followed by ad hoc filtering and detection rules, which have been shown to lead to irreproducible results (38). As shown here, the use of a sensitive variant caller on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing datasets provides a new approach to study this phenomenon.",

Since the putative mechanism of action of the drug is to lead to mutations in cytosine bases (C > N mutagen by inhibition of CMP incorporation (49)), this dataset provides an ideal test-bed for studying quasi species dynamics of the dengue virus using samples from two time points (Table 3). In particular, an important conclusion of the original study was that despite encouraging results in in vitro studies, the drug did not work as expected in vivo (31). To investigate this aspect further, we compared the frequency of C > N mutations in the placebo group versus the drug group (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section) in dengue virus serotype 1, 2 and 3 (DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3) samples using LoFreq SNV calls (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). Our results indicate that no significant changes can be seen in this frequency for any serotype (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P-value > 0.3), providing a molecular basis for the in vivo conclusion of this study. Despite this, we do detect other changes in viral intra-host variation, including an increase in the number of SNVs at later time points, as expected (one-sided Mann\u2013Whitney test P-value < 0.007 for DENV1 placebo group), as well as the disappearance of a mutational hotspot in NS3 (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section) at a later time point, possibly due to adaptation to the host\u2019s immune response (Figure 3).\n\n\n",

This region was only recently shown to be conserved across flaviviruses (51), though this conservation cannot be readily observed from an alignment of >2900 complete dengue virus genomes available in GenBank (Supplementary Figure S5). Comparison of clinical and cell-culture samples for DENV2 also revealed a shared hotspot in the known variable region of the 3-UTR (52), which has been shown to be dispensable for replication in some host cell types (53).",

For example, when viewed on the structure of the NS5 methyltransferase (Figure 4a), a first group of cold-spots consists of contiguous residues completely enclosing the binding site of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) molecule that serves as a methyl donor for the reaction catalyzed by NS5 for capping of viral mRNAs, while a second group of cold-spots corresponds to the carboxyl end which acts as the linker region that connects to the NS5 polymerase domain. Similarly, a representation of cold-spots on the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Figure 4b) encompasses the critical GDD catalytic triad and also most of the template tunnel through which the viral RNA substrate enters or exits during replication. Another example showing cold-spots and hotspots on the NS3 serine protease and helicase, delineating potential interaction surfaces and key resides can be found in Supplementary Figure S6. Our results here suggest that sequencing and characterizing the intra-host variation in a relatively small set of samples can be sufficient for such analysis and reveal candidate drug targets (cold-spots) as well as fast-evolving regions in the viral genome (hotspots) that can be used to estimate haplotype diversity, avoiding the computational complexity of the problem (54). The availability of a sensitive variant caller such as LoFreq thus opens up the potential for the use of this \u2018quasi species footprinting\u2019 approach (akin to phylogenetic footprinting) to reveal functionally important regions in other viral genomes as well.\n",

The sensitivity/specificity tradeoff results here suggest that while model-based approaches (SNVer, Breseq) provide an improvement over ad hoc approaches, further significant gains in sensitivity are possible (without loss in specificity) using a quality-aware approach (LoFreq).

As shown, while germline variants are consistently distributed around 50% (as expected for heterozygous variants), somatic variants are shifted to lower frequencies, likely due to contamination in the tumor sample from normal stromal tissue.

The inner bars mark mutational hotspots (red) and cold-spots (blue), which were derived from intra-host variations called by LoFreq (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). Height of hotspots indicates how often the hotspot was found (sqrt(count)), whereas the height of cold-spots is fixed. The cold-spot in prM is shared between both serotypes. The last hotspot window in NS1 for the DENV2 samples was only found in pre-dose samples (Table 3) and disappears at later time points.",

The nucleoside-analog ribavirin 5\u2032-triphosphate (RTP) is shown in blue and the by-product of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) after the transfer of a methyl group, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), is in red, both in ball-and-stick representation. Cold-spots are colored in violet. The first group of cold-spots consists of contiguous residues which completely enclose the binding site for SAM. SAM molecules serve as a methyl donor in the reaction catalyzed by the NS5 methyltransferase, which results in the capping of viral mRNAs. The second group of cold-spots corresponds to the carboxyl end of the NS5 methyltransferase which act as the linker region that connects the domain to the NS5 polymerase domain. (b) Surface representation of dengue virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (PDB accession number 2J7W). The GDD catalytic triad is colored in red whereas the cold-spots identified from SNV analysis are colored in violet. Cold-spots include the dengue virus NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase GDD catalytic triad and also parts of the template tunnel through which the viral RNA substrate enters and exits during replication.",
