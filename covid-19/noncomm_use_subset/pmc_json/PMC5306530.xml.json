As hospital care represents the most expensive component of a healthcare system,13 making use of these information can help to identify the actual burden for different types of fall-related injuries caused in terms of the frequency of AED visit and the length of stay (LOS) in hospital admission. Moreover, data sources such as death registry can provide insightful information on the pattern of mortality causes. Hospitalisation data, together with the detailed code of diagnosis, have also been recognised as important information for assessing fall-related injuries.14\n15 Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of AED attendances and hospitalisation data in quantifying the burden of fall-related injuries.13\n16\u201318 However, many of these studies mainly focused on fall injuries among older adults or specific occupational groups. There were only few studies examining the fall-related injuries among adolescents and children, as well as the burden caused by different types of fall-related injuries to the healthcare system. This study therefore aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related AED attendance by injury type and the associated hospitalisation among children and adolescents in Hong Kong.",

Over the 12 years, the number of overall fall-related attendance in Hong Kong has been increased and still remains high. Particularly, there have been a growing number of non-fracture cases, whereas the fracture cases remain fairly stable. With the shrinking population size of the children and adolescents aged 0\u201319 over the years from 1 559 736 to 1 230 000, the population size-standardised rates of the overall fall-related attendance have increased substantially among fracture and non-fracture groups.",

Such decrements in AED admission have also been observed worldwide during these outbreaks.21 During the outbreak of highly infectious and fatal diseases, AED became a comparatively high-risk place due to the admissions of newly infected patients. We suspect that although more severe patients with fracture injury would still attend AED for medical care services given no other alternatives for treatments, less severe patients with non-fracture injury would avoid attending AED for treatment during the disease outbreak due to their fear of being infected.22",

The increase in the overall attendance number was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups. The increase in the overall attendance was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups, which could be related the health seeking behaviour of the children's carer. As shown in previous studies, accessibility, convenience,23 high availability24 and confidence in the emergency care are all potential factors that could have driven the increasing number in attendance. Moreover, guardians/carers might sometimes overestimate the severity of their children's injuries,25 causing unnecessary usage of the AED services. This may require a structural change in the resource usage of AED for falls since increasing effort was put for treatment of mild cases. Owing to the fact that overcrowding was a problem to emergency departments in Hong Kong,20 administrative measures such as providing more community care, primary care, community education and change in the admission criteria may relieve possible inappropriate usage of AED services.26\n27 Nonetheless, the boom in non-fracture attendance could be explained by the enhanced awareness of the parents on the safety of their children or improvements in the reputation of AED.",

On the contrary, patients aged 10\u201319 were frequently injured because of falling on the same level instead, either slipping or having collisions with others.13 In our study, while the rate of non-fracture injury admissions in all body regions increased significantly, ankle and foot injuries had the highest annual percentage change followed by wrist and hand injuries. Head injuries had the highest proportion accounting for the number of fall injury attendance in the non-fracture injuries. It escalated to about 1.6 times of its initial value over the 12-year study period. However, such escalation could be accounted by a pure increase in head incidence or an improvement in diagnostic process. Research showed that young children having minor head injuries had low risk to coincide with clinically significant traumatic brain injury.28",

Yet, these two groups of people were different in the pattern of fracture-injured body region; the children and adolescents were most commonly injured with fractures on their upper extremity, while fractures on hips were the most common among the elderly.16 The explanation may lie on the differences in the falling mechanisms and the response time to accidents with respect to children and the elderly. Wrist fractures are usually associated with falling forward or backward with an outstretched hand while hip fractures are often due to falls to the side.29 It was suggested that wrist fractures are more common than hip fractures between ages 65 and 75. However, hip fractures become predominate in ages 75+, probably because of slowed reflexes and loss of ability to protect their hips with their hands.30 When fall occurs, the younger individuals have more available response time than the elderly, and hence they can sufficiently use their hand to land on the ground to protect their hips and prevent their heads from damages.31\n32 Therefore, it is most likely to see that the fracture appeared on the parts of the upper extremity of children and adolescents.",

First, as readmissions to AED were unlikely to be separated from new admissions and be excluded easily, potential double counting may compromise our study. Second, this study only included those subjects with a principal code and without complications of medical care. Hence, the number and the rates may not accurately reflect the actual admissions for each type of injury sustained. Third, we adopted LOS as a proxy for severity of injury which has been criticised for its instability in estimating the injury severity as compared with other standardised scores. However, LOS is a readily available statistic that can be easily understood by general public and LOS can reflect the potential improvements of medical treatments and policy changes in hospital for inpatients over time, which are of interest in our study. Finally, the current study did not examine the details of how falling mechanisms would result in injury of particular body regions among children and adolescents. Fall-preventive measures may be difficult to be implemented in practice. Further study would be needed to elucidate these mechanisms in the near future.",

It is possible that guardians/carers of children became more aware of their children's injuries, and more willing to seek professional help. Appropriate administrative measures in AED can be proposed to relieve possible inappropriate use of services and reduce the waiting time. More importantly, the increased number of childhood injuries signals the inadequacy of preventive measures for fall-related injuries. Different parties should work together and implement more effective preventive measures. For instance, schools can install soft rubber and waterproof floor for students' playgrounds, while parents can create a safe home environment for their children. A further study on disseminating safety knowledge to parents will be conducted.33 In the future, governments should coordinate different parties with appropriate public policy to protect our children from fall-related injuries.",
