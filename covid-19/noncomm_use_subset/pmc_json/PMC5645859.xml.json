The concept of the microbiome was first suggested by Joshua Lederberg, who coined the term \u2018microbiome\u2019 to \u2018signify the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space\u2019 (Lederberg & McCray 2001). It is generally accepted that the term \u2018microbiota\u2019 (in the past also referred to as microflora) is used to describe bacterial communities on mucosal surfaces (with or without luminal microorganisms) or on other body sites (e.g. skin). Overlapping, but distinct, the term \u2018microbiome\u2019 is nowadays used to refer to the entire genetic mass (\u2018genome\u2019) of microorganisms. It is mostly, but incorrectly, used to describe bacterial genomic communities. One should probably refer specifically to the \u2018bacteriome\u2019, \u2018virome\u2019(Mansfield 2015) or \u2018mycobiome\u2019 (Foster et al. 2013), respectively, and use the term microbiome globally for all microorganisms combined (ten Oever & Netea 2014). These microorganisms include eucaryotes, archaea, bacteria, viruses and fungi. Living in such close contact, they usually are not harmful to the host; but considered beneficial in most cases. For example the intestinal microbiota supplies short\u2010chain fatty acids (SCFA) as nutrients for colonocytes (Cummings 1981; R\u00e9rat et al. 1987; Cummings & Macfarlane 1991).",

            "text": "In general, bacterial number and diversity increase gradually along the GI tract (Suchodolski et al. 2005) (Fig. 1). In the healthy canine stomach, total bacterial load is comparably low (105 log10 16S rRNA copy numbers), and mostly belong to Proteobacteria (99.6% of obtained gene sequences) with only few Firmicutes (0.3%) (Garcia\u2010Mazcorro et al. 2012). The predominant species are Helicobacter and Lactobacillus spp. The healthy canine duodenal microbial community as reported by one study to consist of six primary phyla: Firmicutes (46.4% of obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences), Proteobacteria (26.6%), Bacteroidetes (11.2%), Spirochaetes (10.3%) Fusobacteria (3.6%) and Actinobacteria (1%) (Xenoulis et al. 2008). Another study evaluated the microbiota in the jejunum of healthy dogs, and identified Proteobacteria as the most abundant (46%), followed by Firmicutes (15%), Actinobacteria (11.2), Spirochaetes (14.2), Bacteroidetes (6.2%) and Fusobacteria (5.4%) (Suchodolski et al. 2009) (Fig. 1). Duodenal and jejunal ingesta samples contained 22% and 10% of Lactobacillales respectively (Xenoulis et al. 2008). Suchodolski et al. (2009) also identified four additional phyla in the jejunum that were not reported in dogs previously: Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Chloroflex, which were all present in low frequency (<0.1%) (Suchodolski et al. 2009). The ileal ingesta from healthy research dogs predominantly contained Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Suchodolski et al. 2008). This is significantly different to the composition of the duodenal and jejunal microbiome composition, as especially the orders of Fusobacteriales (30%), and Clostridiales (22%) with both Clostridium clusters XI and XIVa were predominant in the healthy ileum. Also in contrast to duodenal and jejunal samples, ileal contents had much lower proportions of Lactobacillus spp. (1.4%). Whether these variations are true qualitative and quantitative differences is hard to assess, as some of them \u2013 especially between different studies \u2013 are likely due to variations in the different DNA extraction methods, differences in amplification primers, and sequencing platforms used (e.g. 454\u2010pyrosequencing vs. 16S rRNA clone libraries). Colon samples showed the co\u2010dominant phyla of Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (around 30% each) in healthy dogs (Suchodolski et al. 2008). The presence of Fusobacteria (108 cfu/ml of intestinal content) also has been demonstrated using culture\u2010based techniques (Davis et al. 1977). The next abundant order present was Clostridiales (18%), with Clostridum cluster XIVa being the predominant member (50%) (Suchodolski et al. 2008). This cluster includes Eubacterium, Roseburia and Ruminococcus spp., which are dietary fibre fermenters. Proteobacteria, including E. coli\u2010like organisms, were present in low proportions (1.4%), whereas Lactobacillales where present at levels similar to the jejunum (10%) (Suchodolski et al. 2008). Results of the analyses of the canine faecal microbiome indicated a predominance of the phyla Fusobacteria (24\u201340%), Bacteroidetes (32\u201334%), Firmicutes (15\u201328%), Proteobacteria (5\u20136%) and Actinobacteria (0.8\u20131.4%) (Xenoulis et al. 2008; Suchodolski et al. 2009; Middelbos et al. 2010; Handl et al. 2011; Swanson et al. 2011; Garcia\u2010Mazcorro et al. 2012) (Fig. 1).",

Firstly, traditional plating techniques or qPCR to quantify a limited number of bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridia, E. coli) were mostly used (Spears et al. 2005; Strompfov\u00e1 et al. 2012a). Second, most studies were performed in healthy dogs, which make inferring results to diseased dogs or animals susceptible to GI disturbances (e.g. weanlings and geriatrics) difficult. Third, faecal samples were analysed rather than mucosal biopsies or ingesta (Spears et al. 2005; Verlinden et al. 2006; Hang et al. 2012; Strompfov\u00e1 et al. 2012b). Lastly, a wide range of prebiotic products and dosages have been administered, making comparisons between studies difficult. The authors of this review recently analysed the faecal microbiome of dogs with food\u2010responsive chronic enteropathy (CE) before and after 6 weeks of dietary intervention and compared these to the faecal microbiome of healthy dogs before and after they were switched to the same diet used in the diseased dogs (a hydrolysed protein diet), and could not detect a significant effect on microbial composition or diversity attributed to the dietary change (Schmitz et al., unpublished data). More research using molecular sequencing techniques is clearly needed to examine the effect of dietary interventions in healthy dogs and dogs with GI disease.",

This included increased abundance of Clostridium spp. (especially C. perfringens), E. coli, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus spp. with concurrent reductions of those bacterial groups that make up the majority of the normal colonic microbiota, such as Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia spp. (Bell et al. 2008; Minamoto et al. 2014b; Guard et al. 2015). In chronic diarrhoea, significantly higher counts of Bacteroides sp. were found using fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis (Jia et al. 2010).

These mechanisms are thought to be strain specific, with some strains having increased adherence capabilities (e.g. L. rhamnosus GG = LGG), and some strains being able to increase the adherence of pathogens to intestinal mucus (Collado et al. 2007b). In addition, probiotic bacteria can produce various antimicrobial substances, for example fatty acids, lactic acid and acetic acid (Saarela et al. 2000). Some Lactobacillus spp. can decrease toxin gene expression and production by Salmonella, E.coli or C. perfringens in vitro (Medellin\u2010Pe\u00f1a et al. 2007; Allaart et al. 2011; Bayoumi & Griffiths 2012) or inactivate toxins by production of proteases ex vivo (Castagliuolo et al. 1999). Immune modulation of the host organism \u2013 especially intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)\u2013 might occur through microbial cell wall components, their metabolites or DNA (Oelschlaeger 2010; Thomas & Versalovic 2010).

Several mechanistic studies show that key biological signalling pathways like nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), mitogen\u2010activated protein (MAP) kinases, Akt/phosphatidyl inositol\u20103 kinase (PI3K) and peroxisome proliferated activator of transcription receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) are targets for probiotics or their products both in vitro and in vivo (Thomas & Versalovic 2010) (Fig. 3). These pathways can be modified in different ways by individual probiotic strains. This is clearly a strain\u2010specific effect, as even bacterial strains of the same species can alter cellular responses differentially.

Even though most products available in Europe to date contain the E. faecium strain NCIMB 10415 E1707, sometimes in combination with other bacterial strains and different prebiotics, the products themselves have mostly not been specifically approved or tested. On the other hand, E. faecium NCIMB 10415 E1707 has been used most widely in experimental settings, to assess effect on immune function or gut health (see below). Other bacterial strains available as over\u2010the\u2010counter supplements for dogs contain different strains of Lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L. lactis, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius), Bifidobacteria (B. infantis, B. lactis, B. longum, B. bifidum), Bacillus subtilis or coagulans and in some cases yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or other fungi (Aspergillus oryzae). However, limited data are available about the safety and efficacy of these microorganisms/products or the health claims associated with them. Some microorganisms other than E. faecium have been tested as probiotics in experimental settings in dogs. For example Saccharomyces boulardii was investigated in a small pilot study presented as a congress abstract in dogs with IBD and protein\u2010losing enteropathy (P\u2010LE); (Bresciani et al. 2014)]. It significantly improved clinical activity score and serum albumin levels compared to the placebo\u2010treated control dogs (Bresciani et al. 2014). Apart from single bacterial strains tested in vitro (detailed below), some single\u2010 and multi\u2010strain probiotic products have also been tested to a certain degree in a clinical setting in dogs. For most single\u2010strain studies, this is limited to the use of E. faecium (Swanson et al. 2002; Sauter et al. 2006; Strompfov\u00e1 et al. 2006; Schmitz et al. 2015a). Several probiotic cocktails have been used with variable effect. For example a mixture of lactobacilli that showed promising ex vivo results regarding creating a more tolerant microenvironment in the gut, did not significantly improve outcome when administered in a clinical trial (Sauter et al. 2006). In another study, strains from a product approved for the use in people (VSL#3) have been administered to dogs with IBD leading to some clinical and immunological improvement (Rossi et al. 2014). This includes four Lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus), three Bifidobacteria (B. breve, B. longum, B. infantis) and Streptococcus thermophilus.",

Survival characteristics of probiotic strains (especially E. faecium) have been tested in vitro and in vivo, that is in low environmental pH (mimicking gastric passage), the presence of bile, adhesion to mucus, recovery of live bacteria from faeces of dogs after oral administration (Laukov\u00e1 et al. 2004, 2008; Strompfov\u00e1 et al. 2004a; Marci\u0148\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2006). Overall, it is not entirely clear if probiotic survival is even necessary for a beneficial effect, or if, for example their DNA is sufficient (Kant et al. 2014). There is some evidence that even non\u2010viable probiotic bacteria can cause immune modulation in the host (Zhong et al. 2012). Also, there is very little information regarding possible interactions of strains in multi\u2010strain formulations; even though some studies in experimental rodents or humans show a synergistic effect on the measured outcome (Baillon et al. 2004). The effect of formulation (liquid, capsule, in\u2010feed) or natural sources of potential probiotics (yoghurt, raw green tripe, fermented plant material) is mostly unexplored to date. Some preliminary data on the effect of feeding raw meat, prebiotic fibre and yeast cell wall extract on the composition of faecal microbiota are available (Beloshapka et al. 2013). Changes depending on the meat protein source (chicken vs. beef) were less evident, but minor changes in faecal microbiota composition were seen when prebiotics were added (e.g. greater presence of fusobacteria, lower abundance of Faecalibacterium). The significance of these observed changes, however, remains unclear, especially as this study was performed in healthy dogs. Furthermore, most studies evaluated faecal samples and noticed only minor changes. However, recent studies suggest that probiotic mixtures (i.e. VSL#3) are able to induce major changes in the ileal mucosa\u2010adherent microbiota in colitic mice and also dogs with chronic enteropathies (Mar et al. 2014; White et al. 2015).",

Main outcome measures included determination of total faecal IgA, total and vaccine\u2010specific immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) and IgA serum concentrations, and quantification of circulating lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry.

It was orally administered to healthy adult dogs of different breeds and ages for 1 week at a daily dosage of 2\u20133 \u00d7 109 cfu dog\u22121. Faecal cultures and blood samples for routine biochemistry values were obtained before and at the end of the treatment period, as well as 1, 2 and 3 months after cessation of probiotic administration.

Using E. faecium SF68, there was no effect on kennel stress\u2010associated diarrhoea, which might partially be due to the low prevalence of diarrhoea in this study (Bybee et al. 2011). Faecal scores were significantly improved in dogs undergoing kennelling stress when supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis AHC7 compared with an untreated control group (Kelley et al. 2012).

There were no control dogs in this pilot study, hence the exact potential of this inactivated bacterial mixture needs to be evaluated by further clinical studies. Interestingly, administration of Saccharomyces boulardii to dogs with experimental lincomycin\u2010induced diarrhoea could prevent, but not treat this condition (Aktas et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Similar to people, the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions of the GI tract in dogs (e.g. CE/IBD) is assumed to be due to an aberrant response of the immune\u2010system to the luminal or adherent intestinal microbiota (Sartor 2006; Hall & German 2010). There is ample evidence of immune dysregulation, even though the exact type of inflammatory response and pathogenesis has not been elucidated yet (German et al. 2000; Peters et al. 2005; Jergens et al. 2009; Schmitz et al. 2012). Several studies have shown that there are also alterations of the intestinal microbiome present in canine CE/IBD (Suchodolski et al. 2012a, b). Hence, there have been several attempts to influence the composition of the microbiota in those dogs to alleviate clinical signs; partially using probiotics that had already shown to have some immune\u2010modulatory properties in in vitro or ex vivo studies (Sauter et al. 2005, 2006; Schmitz et al. 2013, 2014). E. faecium NCIMB 10415 E1707 has been assessed as a single\u2010strain treatment in dogs with food\u2010responsive disease (FRD) and found to have no effect on clinical activity score, histology scores or duodenal and colonic gene expression of selected genes associated with specific T\u2010helper lymphocyte lines (Schmitz et al. 2015b). In addition, there was also no effect of E. faecium treatment on gene or protein expression of inflammasome compounds (Schmitz et al. 2015b). More promising results could be achieved by using probiotic mixtures in FRD dogs: A combination of LAB (L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) reduced duodenal interleukin (IL)\u201010 and colonic interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) mRNA levels and the number of faecal Enterobacteriaceae, whereas numbers of Lactobacillus spp. increased. Clinical improvement was noted to similar levels in dogs receiving the LAB cocktail compared with dogs treated with diet alone (Sauter et al. 2005).",

Clinical activity, duodenal histology scores and CD3+ lymphocytes in the intestinal tissue decreased post\u2010treatment in both groups. However, FoxP3+ cells (a marker of regulatory T\u2010helper lymphocytes [Tregs]) increased significantly after treatment only in the dogs treated with VSL#3 strains. Also, transforming growth factor beta (TGFb)+ cells (most likely Tregs) increased in both groups after treatment, but to a greater magnitude in probiotic treated dogs. There was some effect of the probiotics on expression of tight junction proteins, with occludin being significantly elevated in healthy control dogs and dogs treated with probiotics compared with IBD dogs. Microbiome analysis based on quantitative PCR revealed a reduced abundance of Faecalibacterium and Turicibacter in dogs with IBD at the start of the trial, with a significant increase in Faecalibacterium observed in the animals treated with VSL#3 strains (Rossi et al. 2014). This is noteworthy, as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been advocated as an anti\u2010inflammatory commensal bacterium in people (Miquel et al. 2013) and is of lower abundance in intestinal contents or faecal samples from human and canine IBD patients (Suchodolski et al. 2012b; Fujimoto et al. 2013).",

Dogs with CE or PLE additionally received standard medical treatment consisting of diet, antibiotics and/or immunosuppressive drugs.

In dogs with CE, clinical score improved significantly, and in dogs with PLE serum albumin values increased significantly compared with placebo treatment. Duodenal endoscopic and histology scores were not different before and after treatment in any of the dogs. The study concluded that S. boulardii can be safely administered to dogs and it might be useful as an adjunctive treatment in CE and PLE (Bresciani et al. 2014). However, as it is a small study and has not been fully published yet, awaiting of the full results and further research into the usefulness of S. boulardii as a potential probiotic is warranted.",

            "text": "Administration of single\u2010strain or even multi\u2010strain probiotic products might have a limited ability to influence the composition of the intestinal microbiome permanently, especially given the fact that the microbiome consists of hundreds of microbial species. Based on the assumption that a more complex change is needed in certain conditions (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection or IBD), there have been attempts of transferring the intestinal microbiota from one subject to another. This has been termed faecal microbial transplantation (FMT), microbiome restorative therapy or faecal bacteriotherapy. In human medicine, FMT has been mostly performed for recurrent C. difficile infection. Two reviews show that it is safe and effective in 83\u201392% of human patients, which achieved full resolution of clinical signs (Gough et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2012). Limited clinical data are available evaluating the use of FMT for IBD in humans, but pilot studies suggest that the response rate to FMT in chronic intestinal inflammation is much lower compared with C. difficile infection (Colman & Rubin 2014). Experience in small animals regarding the safety and efficacy of FMT is scarce and anecdotal. Two congress abstracts report some preliminary findings in dogs. One is a case report of an ongoing study (not published), where a dog with eosinophilic IBD of 2 years duration and moderate clinical signs with conventional therapy was given the FMT by enema, with 45 min retention time. Faecal consistency improved within 24 h and the dog had been clinically well at the time of the report (3 months after treatment). Next\u2010generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the faecal microbiome revealed that by day 2 after FMT, the dogs\u2019 faecal sample clustered with the donor, not the own baseline sample, and species richness increased compared to pre\u2010treatment values (Weese 2013). The other abstract reports the use of FMT in 8 dogs with refractory presumptive Clostridium perfringens\u2010associated diarrhoea (Murphy et al. 2014). Again, it was administered as an enema (1\u20133 transplants per dog). All dogs had immediate resolution of their diarrhoea and 6/8 dogs were negative on follow\u2010up PCR panels for C. perfringens alpha toxin. As mentioned before, C. perfringens can be part of the normal intestinal flora in dogs, hence it remains unclear if the detected C. perfringens was really the cause of the diarrhoea or rather a part of intestinal dysbiosis (Minamoto et al. 2014b). If that had been the case, it needs still to be critically assessed whether the FMT addressed Clostridiosis, even if the microbiome changes suggest an improvement of faecal dysbiosis. Both authors of the unpublished conference abstracts conclude that FMT should be considered as a treatment option in dogs failing other therapeutic options (Weese 2013; Murphy et al. 2014) and anecdotal evidence of its usefulness is increasing in the veterinary community. Prospective studies in large cohorts of dogs are needed to properly address the usefulness of FMT in defined GI diseases in dogs.",

            "text": "The microbiota on mucosal surfaces, especially the GI tract, in dogs is complex. The composition varies from site to site and there is some evidence that changes in the composition of the microbiota/microbiome are associated with certain diseases. However, analysis of the canine GI and faecal microbiota composition, its function, production of metabolites and immunological properties is far from complete, even though data on the microbiome are accumulating. Accordingly, overall knowledge of the best characteristics of a canine microbial commensal or probiotic is patchy and most assumptions about their best properties are derived from human studies. There are some bacterial strains that show promise as potential probiotics, especially LAB. However, the effects of the most commonly used strain (E. faecium) are still not well understood, particularly in diseased dogs. It is challenging to compare outcomes of different studies, both in healthy and in diseased dogs, as there is huge variation in the probiotics used (single\u2010strain, multi\u2010strain, type of microorganism), their dosage, application form and frequency. Measured outcomes are also not consistent. Overall, it seems to the authors that E. faecium tends to be more suitable for acute and/or infectious forms of diarrhoea; as there is some evidence it produces a more pro\u2010inflammatory rather than anti\u2010inflammatory reaction (Schmitz et al. 2014, 2015b); whereas some lactobacilli and bifidobacteria show more pronounced immune\u2010regulatory functions. Intriguingly, especially a combination of LABs (VSL#3) used in human medicine to prevent relapse of Ulcerative Colitis has some promise in treating chronic enteropathies in dogs and in creating a more anti\u2010inflammatory local environment (Rossi et al. 2014). It is interesting to note that even in well\u2010defined infectious diseases like parvovirosis or parasitic infestation, some probiotics show a beneficial effect. The mechanism behind this is not well understood and further research is warranted. It is clear from studies in people and experimental rodents, that the immunological outcome depends on both the bacterial strain or even subspecies \u2013 probably in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Weese & Anderson 2002; Evrard et al. 2011; Garcia\u2010Mazcorro et al. 2011) \u2013 and the respective host's immune response. In humans, probiotics have been classified into \u2018pro\u2010inflammatory\u2019 and \u2018anti\u2010inflammatory\u2019 by some authors, depending on their major properties (Shida et al. 2011). Because of this, careful assessment of potential probiotics in the target species and disease \u2013 possibly both in vitro and in vivo \u2013 is necessary to judge their full potential. Some authors even propose to test all probiotics in vitro or in tissue explants first, before performing in vivo trials (Tsilingiri et al. 2012). However, this might not always be possible in veterinary medicine.",
