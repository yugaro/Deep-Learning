He visited a hospital due to pneumonia; it was later found out that renal failure developed (1). He eventually died due to his illnesses. From 1 June 2015, 1,154 patients were infected with the virus; 431 patients died (WHO http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/). MERS is suspected to spread from animals to humans like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was from a similar coronavirus with respiratory infection syndromes and it is highly transmitted. Additionally, since the virus is related to a high rate of fatality, it has become a big issue for public health doctors and officials over the world.",

From the development of the disease to the patient's admission, it takes 4 days and the period that people die from the disease takes 11.5 days (2). In the first stage, flu like symptoms such as fever, coughing, chilling, myalgia, and arthralgia are observed. After this, respiratory difficulty is added. This quickly progresses to pneumonia (3). A part (30%) of the patients complain of bowel symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea (1). Cases of MERS-CoV can be found in countries like America, UK, France, Tunisia, Italy, Malaysia, the Philippines, Greece, Egypt, the Netherlands, Algeria, Austria, Turkey, etc. whose citizens have travelled to the Middle East.",

On May 4 2015, this patient entered in Korea, and febrile sense and respiratory symptoms appeared on May 11. He visited Clinic A on the day and was admitted to Hospital B from May 15 to 17. Since the symptoms got worsened, he visited Clinic C on May 18, and finally he was transferred to a university hospital in Seoul on May 18. On May 20, it was confirmed that he was suffering from MERS-CoV. After finding out about the disease, his family members and medical staffs who had been exposed to the virus were isolated. By June 9, 2015, 2 medical staffs in the Clinic A and C, one medical staff in the Hospital B, one patient and her wife who was together with the index case in the same room and 35 of admitted patients in the same ward and their family members visiting same ward with the index case in the Hospital B were confirmed to have been infected with MERS-CoV. After then, several tertiary cases were identified in the Hospital B or other hospitals that secondary patients were transferred from the Hospital B. A total of 108 people were infected, and 9 (8.3%) of them died by June 10, 2015.",

The secondary infection occurred from the index case before the correct diagnosis, which was inevitable. At present, the Korea CDC should focus on close monitoring of medical staffs and patients or visitors who have been exposed to the index, secondary, and tertiary cases in hospitals. It is very important to make nationwide effort to cope with this outbreak more actively and aggressively by organizing an emergency team with medical experts. Also correct and timely well-designed briefing to mass media is necessary in order to prevent further spread, to calm down public panic, and to lessen its untoward impacts in the society.",
