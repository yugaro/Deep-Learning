Our results indicate that the number of MERS-CoV cases and deaths remained inconsistent from the beginning of June to the end of December 2013 and that MERS-CoV incidence peaked twice, in June and September 2013. MERS-CoV incidence was very low in the months of January, February, and March 2014; however, incidence was observed and then peaked at the end of April. Therefore, we expected that MERS-CoV incidence would continue to increase until the end of June 2014. Saudi Arabia is in the Northern hemisphere, where the incidence of influenza is highest in winter, peaking between December and March.8 However, the highest rates of MERS-CoV cases and deaths were not observed in Winter, but in mid-Spring, between April and May.",

A recent study suggests that there is also a higher incidence of influenza in men than in women, which is due to a higher level of testosterone and a corresponding suppression of their immune response.9 Thus, a similar relationship may exist with MERS-CoV, and consequently, men with a lower level of testosterone may have improved immunity to viral infection.9 Another possible explanation for a higher incidence of MERS-CoV among men is that men are likely to spend more time outdoors and thus have a higher risk of exposure to a source of infection.",

In Jeddah and Mecca, there is concern about the increase of MERS-CoV cases because hundreds of thousands of people frequently travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah and Hajj. Although no Hajj-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported, Umrah-associated cases have.11\u201313 Therefore, the World Health Organization suggests that governments should provide advice on the risk of infection to pilgrims with major medical problems, such as chronic diseases. In addition, general travel health information should be provided, including advice on food safety practices, good personal hygiene, and avoiding unnecessary farm visits and contact with animals.14",
