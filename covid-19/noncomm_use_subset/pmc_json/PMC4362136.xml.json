Current uses of beta-blockers in cardiovascular diseases (CD) include ischemic heart diseases, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. Other substantial non-cardiac uses include glaucoma, migraine, situational anxiety, benign essential tremors, and cardiac symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. The authors conclude that beta-blockers may no longer be the undisputed leader, however they still hold a special place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension due to their cost-effectiveness, and a reasonable adverse effects profile.",
