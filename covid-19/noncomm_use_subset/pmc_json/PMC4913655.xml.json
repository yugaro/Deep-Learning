Also, high analytical sensitivity of a PCR assay does not necessarily imply high clinical sensitivity. In other words, an assay may detect minute quantities of DNA in the laboratory but have poor sensitivity for detection of a pathogen in a blood specimen. Most PCR assays utilize 10\u2013200 \u03bcL of blood, and animals can receive over 10,000 times that volume during a transfusion. Although most molecular assays have high analytical sensitivity, these assays cannot amplify microbes that are not in the specimen collected; thus, false negative results can occur with some agents found in very low quantities in the bloodstream, such as Ehrlichia canis and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).",

Donation screening or inactivation by pathogen reduction technologies is considered in human medicine.5 Anaplasmosis occurred in a splenectomized dog on chemotherapy after a packed RBC transfusion; both the donor and recipient tested positive by PCR (Kohn unpublished data).

Experimentally, SC inoculation of E. canis results in dose\u2010dependent infection and positive blood cultures.28 Screening of potential donor dogs for antibodies to some Ehrlichia antigens can be performed by IFA assay, 1 of several commercial point\u2010of\u2010care assays,1,3,4 or other laboratory\u2010based assays.b Variable serologic cross\u2010reactivity occurs among some Ehrlichia species.

In general, dogs are subclinically infected with these organisms, but M. haemocanis can cause anemia in splenectomized dogs, with a few case reports of infected dogs with other immunocompromising comorbidities. Only a single clinical infection with \u201cCandidatus M. haematoparvum\u201d has been reported in a splenectomized dog with hemic neoplasia being treated with chemotherapy, and it was unclear to what extent the hemoplasma played a role in development of anemia.33 This dog received several units of blood products, some of which tested positive using PCR for \u201cCandidatus M. haematoparvum,\u201d and tested negative before transfusion (Sykes et al, unpublished data). Therefore, optimally, donor dogs should be screened for all hemoplasma by PCR assay and excluded if positive (Table 1).

It also should be kept in mind that the prevalence of hemoplasma infection in the general client\u2010owned pet dog population in North America appears to be low (<5%).34 Whether the viability of canine hemoplasma species is lost during storage of blood products (see feline hemoplasmas) requires further study.

Visceral leishmaniosis has been transmitted by blood transfusion to dogs, with clinically healthy foxhounds as blood donors.39 A retrospective study (2000\u20132003) performed on 12,000 serum samples from foxhounds and other canids in the United States reported an 8.9% seroprevalence in foxhounds, but no other randomly selected domestic dogs or wild canids were seropositive.40 Because the infection appears to be only endemic within foxhounds in North America, screening of every potential blood donor is not necessary. However, all foxhounds and dogs with travel history to or from endemic countries should be screened for Leishmania spp infection using IFA serology performed by a reputable laboratory. Because IFA serology may lack sensitivity in subclinically infected dogs,41 foxhounds or dogs living in or traveling to endemic areas, and found to be seronegative should then be screened additionally by Leishmania PCR.38, 42, 43 The IFA assay for Leishmania spp. can cross\u2010react with Trypanosoma cruzi.44 Although dogs with either infection should be excluded as blood donors, Leishmania spp. seropositive dogs can be evaluated for the presence of specific antibodies to T. cruzi if further clinical information is desired.44\n",

After tick transmission, the organism undergoes schizogony in myeloid cells (specific lineage is unknown) followed by merogony in erythrocytes. The schizogenous stage is associated with illness and disease can be transmitted experimentally by transmission of blood from a cat with cytauxzoonosis to a naive cat.88 The majority of cats with cytauxzoonosis that are presented to veterinary hospitals develop severe febrile illness, cytopenias, and often die within 5 days of presentation if appropriate treatments are not given. A carrier state (erythrocyte infection only) has been identified that is not associated with clinical disease.89 In fact, transfusion of blood from a chronically infected cat into a naive cat does not result in illness.

In the presence of any of these findings, culture of the blood should be performed to determine whether contamination has occurred. If the unit appears abnormal, it should not be administered.Currently, screening of individual units for infectious disease is not practical in veterinary medicine because of the turnaround time and costs of testing.
