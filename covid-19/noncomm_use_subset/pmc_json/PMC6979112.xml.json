Neurological examination revealed obtunded mentation, mild ambulatory tetraparesis and vestibulo\u2010cerebellar ataxia, occasional truncal swaying with the tendency to fall on both sides and generalised whole body tremors. The postural responses were markedly delayed to absent in all limbs. Menace response was absent bilaterally. The findings indicated a multifocal intracranial lesion affecting the central vestibular system (cerebellum and brainstem) and forebrain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected multiple haemorrhagic lesions in the forebrain, thalamus, mesencephalon and metencephalon. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection was not performed due to the increased risk of bleeding. Baermann test and zinc sulfate flotation with centrifugation performed on faecal samples were positive for lungworm larvae and an antigenic test confirmed Angiostrongylus vasorum infection. Anthelmintic treatment was started with consequent marked clinical improvement. Seventy days later the dog was clinically normal and no larvae were detected on Baermann test. Repeat MRI of the brain revealed marked improvement of the haemorrhagic lesions. CSF then showed marked eosinophilic pleocytosis and anthelmintic treatment was restarted. Follow up CSF analysis 4 months after first presentation revealed resolution of the eosinophilic pleocytosis.",

The cuff design is based on the anatomy of sheep sacral nerves. Using this implant, we have conducted impedance measurements following stimulation of explanted pig vagal nerves. This showed impedance values of ~5k\u03a9 for frequencies ranging 100\u20101,000Hz, which fulfils theoretical requirements for afferent bladder sacral nerve recording. This cuff contains up to 10 electrodes to exploit the method of velocity selective recording, a powerful technique to discriminate various afferent fibres based on their conduction velocity. In particular, we plan to use this device in a sheep model, in which bladder afferents coding for pressure and volume of the urinary bladder are similar to man, ~38 and 41 m/s respectively.",

The lesions were isointense in T1W images and showed a mild contrast enhancement and a mild mass effect. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not show significant abnormalities. The gastric content was toxicologically tested and found to be positive for metaldehyde screening. Thus, a diagnosis of metaldehyde intoxication was made. The dog progressively recovered to normal within 7 days with antiepileptic and supportive therapy. A 2 month\u2010follow up MRI showed small, symmetrically well defined bilateral lesions in the caudate nuclei with a hyperintense signal in T2W images and a hypointense signal in T1W images, which were interpreted as cavitated lesions.

CNS Lymphoma associated with CD has not been reported in small animals previously.

Neuroanatomic diagnosis indicated a diffuse cerebellar lesion. Blood count analysis showed thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated mononuclear and neutrophilic pleocytosis. Contrast CT imaging revealed multiple hypodense heterogeneous areas in both cerebral hemispheres, mild ventriculomegaly at the level of the caudal fossa, and a circular sharply marginated, homogeneously hyperdense mass occupying the right cerebellar hemisphere. Post\u2010mortem study indicated a 5 mm x 1 mm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere close to the vermis. Histopathological analysis showed diffuse and severe loss of Purkinje cells with a decrease in the density of granular cells and moderate gliosis. Additionally, numerous neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the infiltrated mass consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. Inmunohistochemestry revealed expression of CD20 and a B\u2010cell inmunophenotype.
