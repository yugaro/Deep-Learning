Nair et al. estimated that 111 500 deaths in children <5 years were attributable to influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) in 2008, the vast majority of which occurred in developing countries.10 RSV was estimated to have caused 33.8 million LRI episode in children under five, of which 3.4 million were severe causing up to 199 000 deaths.11 In addition to the health burden of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the economic impact is also high if we account for health care costs (direct cost) and loss of productivity (indirect cost). A study by Fendrik et al. estimated the total economic impact of non-influenza-related viral RTIs in the United States at $40 billion annually.12",

To simplify the analysis, we treated subtypes or genotypes of a virus as a single group (e.g. RSV for RSVA and RSVB, etc.). Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology or co-infection (Table 2). Additionally, we investigated the seasonal variation of viruses. Rhinovirus infections were detected throughout the year however the peak rate occurred during the main rainy months (November, December), likely for Coxsackie/Echovirus and RSV. On the other hand, Influenza A virus infections had a peak in the fall (September, October); (Figure 3). In terms of clinical symptoms, fever, cough and rhinorrhea were major symptoms observed in most of the patients infected with one or more respiratory virus (Table 2). Chi-square analysis revealed a significant correlation between rhinorrhea and INF, CVEV, and RhV and coinfection (Table 2). Bivariate logistic regression was then performed to determine the risk associated with these infections. Our analysis revealed that RhV or CVEV infected patients or patients infected with more than one virus were more likely to have rhinorrhea (OR for RhV: 2.25; CI: 1.18 \u2013 4.31; OR for CVEV: 5.57; CI: 1.90 \u2013 16.28; OR for co-infection: 6.34; CI: 2.17\u201318.44).",
