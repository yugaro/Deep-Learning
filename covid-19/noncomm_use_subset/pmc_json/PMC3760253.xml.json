            "text": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans are zoonoses, and the majority of these originate in wildlife (1\u20133). These diseases are largely viral (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Nipah virus) and represent a significant global health threat. Analyses of trends in EIDs suggest that the rate of infectious disease emergence is increasing (3) and that the emergence of new viruses is not yet constrained by the richness (number of viruses) or diversity (genetic variability) of unknown viruses in wildlife, which is thought to be high. Systematically measuring viral richness, abundance, and diversity (here termed \u201cvirodiversity\u201d) in wildlife is hindered by the large number of host species (e.g., around 5,500 mammals), their global distribution and often remote habitats (4), and the expense of collection, sampling, and viral identification or discovery (5), and it has not yet been achieved for even a single host species. In this study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate primers targeting nine viral families to discover a large number and diversity of viruses. We then adapted the techniques normally used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants to estimate the total viral richness within these nine families in P. giganteus. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept and provide the first statistically supported estimates of the unknown viral richness of a mammalian host and the sampling effort required to achieve it.",

None of the samples were positive for IFAVs or HTVs, despite previous studies documenting their presence in other bat species (6\u20138); however, a total of 985 viral sequences representing the other seven viral families were detected in these bats. These sequences were segregated into 55 discrete viruses based on distinct monophyletic clustering (see Materials and Methods) (Table 1), and a virus was considered novel if the sequence identity to its closest relative was less than or equal to the identity between the two closest species for a given viral family (9).",

            "text": "Eleven PMVs were detected, including 10 novel viruses (PMV-1 from P. giganteus [PgPMV-1] to PgPMV-10) and Nipah virus (PgPMV-11). These PMVs exhibited high sequence variation and clustered phylogenetically with either the rubulaviruses or an unassigned group related to the henipaviruses (Fig. 1). Within the AdV family, 14 viruses were discovered (PgAdV-1 to -14). Thirteen were novel mastadenoviruses, while one virus (PgAdV-2) had 98% nucleotide identity to the aviadenovirus Fowl adenovirus E (Fig. 2). Eight different AstVs were found (PgAstV-1 to -8), all of which were novel and clustered within the genus Mamastrovirus (Fig. 3). Within the CoV family, four distinct viruses were discovered. The first two were closely related betacoronaviruses (PgCoV-1 and -2). The third was also a betacoronavirus (PgCoV-3) but was more distantly related and showed 97% nucleotide identity to bovine and human coronaviruses (human strains 4408 and OC43). The fourth CoV was a gammacoronavirus (PgCoV-4) with 91% nucleotide identity (97% at the amino acid level) to the avian Infectious bronchitis virus (Fig. 4). Three novel PyVs were identified (PgPyV-1 to -3), all of which clustered with viruses in the genus Orthopolyomavirus (Fig. 5). A total of 639 HV sequences were detected, which segregated into 13 distinct clades (PgHV 1 to 13) using hierarchical clustering (see Materials and Methods). None could be reliably classified within any existing genus, and they likely represent new groups within the Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies (Fig. 6). One virus, PgHV-11, appears to be a recombinant between PgHV-10 and PgHV-13, with a breakpoint evident at approximately nucleotide 90. Upstream from this breakpoint, the sequences for PgHV-11 are related to PgHV-10, while downstream from the breakpoint, they are related to PgHV-13. Finally, two different BoVs were discovered (PgBoV-1 and -2), both of which showed >98% nucleotide identity to known human BoVs (Fig. 7).",

To ensure internal consistency, only those samples screened for the full complement of nine viral families/genera were included (n = 1,092), which accounted for 44/55 viruses identified in this study. The relative frequency of these viruses is presented in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Of the 1,092 samples included, 766 were negative for all viruses. There were 595 viral detections from 326 positive samples, with 167 samples containing >1 virus. When all 44 viruses were considered, the accumulative discovery curve began to show signs of saturation (Fig. 8). The Chao2 estimator demonstrated asymptotic behavior as early as 500 samples (<50% of tested samples) and was highly stable (low variance) by 1,000 samples (Fig. 8). The total viral richness within our sample population was estimated to be 58 viruses (limited to viral families tested for), and the required sampling effort to discover all 58 was estimated to be 7,079 samples. Asymptotic estimates of viral richness were also calculated individually for PMVs, AstVs, HVs, and AdVs (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). For HVs, AstVs, and PMVs, estimates were stable or stabilizing and showed that most of the predicted viral diversity had been identified. For AdVs, none of the estimators stabilized, probably due to a high singleton-to-doubleton ratio (i.e., the rate of discovery of new viruses was still high). Individual assessments were not performed for CoVs, PyVs, or BoVs because a lack of single or double detections prevented meaningful estimates (10).",

However, these assessments principally consider the emergence of disease-causing agents rather than an ecological assessment of virodiversity. Here, we measured viral richness using nonparametric species discovery curves, which are commonly used in biodiversity studies (10, 13, 15\u201317) and rely on the frequency of rarely occurring species to measure the completeness of discovery (15) and make statistical estimations of the undiscovered fraction (10). Our estimate of the viral carrying capacity of P. giganteus as 58 viruses (for the nine viral families assayed) was robustly supported, with the cumulative number of new viruses slowing toward an asymptotic trajectory and with statistical estimators showing reliably asymptotic behavior. Given that our total discovery effort revealed 55 of the estimated 58 viruses, we suggest that most have now been identified and that the remaining viruses in P. giganteus in Bangladesh are extremely rare. However, we make the qualification that this estimation of richness is likely a minimum and that additional viruses will almost certainly be found through the expansion of viral family testing and the use of high-throughput sequencing.",

In general, surveys for undiscovered diversity present diminishing returns, since the commonly occurring species are quickly identified, while the rare species require an increasingly large sampling effort. Here, the Chao 2 estimator predicted that 85% of the total richness could be achieved if another ~500 samples were screened but that a further ~5,500 would then be required to find the remaining 15%. Considering that only very rare viruses would exist within this final fraction and assuming that this rarity reduces both exposure and the chance of transmission, the public health advantage gained by knowledge of their biological properties or taxonomy may not be sufficiently high to justify the cost of their discovery. Similar estimations were made for each of the viral families individually. For example, 13 HVs were discovered in a total of 1,741 samples, with an estimated 8,503 additional samples needed to identify just 2 more predicted viruses (100% of the estimated). Equally, 11 PMVs were identified in 1,108 samples, with one additional virus projected from a further 773 samples. In both cases, an extremely limited return is expected from a costly discovery effort.",

If we assume that all 5,486 described mammalian species (19) harbor an average of 58 viruses in the nine families of interest (as estimated here in P. giganteus) and that these viruses exhibit 100% host specificity, the total richness of mammalian viruses awaiting discovery exceeds ~320,000. We used the data on expenditures for surveillance and pathogen discovery in this study to calculate the direct cost of discovering all 58 viruses in P. giganteus (see the supplemental material for details of this cost analysis). We estimate this cost to be $1.2 million, including collection and laboratory testing of 7,079 samples. Assuming expenditures to be equal for all host species, the cost of sampling and viral discovery for all mammalian viruses would be approximately $6.3 billion. Accounting for diminishing returns means that discovering 85% of the estimated diversity would be disproportionately cheaper at approximately $1.4 billion. Our estimates of virodiversity and cost of discovery are preliminary; however, we include them to demonstrate (i) how a systematic estimation of total viral diversity could be used to inform better surveillance through strategic resource allocation and (ii) that, given our cost estimates, the discovery of the majority of potential zoonotic viruses is not an unattainable goal over the next few decades. The generation of sequence data will not, of course, in itself prevent pandemics. However, it does provide data that refine our knowledge of the functional relationship between host and viral diversity, including traits associated with increased risk of spillover and subsequent emergence (e.g., viruses closely related to and sharing receptor binding domains with known lethal agents [20]) and, also, facilitates the development of rapid diagnostic tests for intervention and control.",

Clearly, many of these limitations and assumptions require additional exploration. For example, while including more viral families in our survey would increase the viral richness estimate, accounting for species turnover (viral sharing between species) would reduce it. Also, while the cost of sample collection in Bangladesh is relatively low because of logistical simplicities, in some regions (e.g., tropical montane forests of Africa and Southeast Asia), the cost of transportation is much higher. Better estimates of the total number of viruses in mammals (and the cost of their discovery) will be achieved iteratively as other hosts are more extensively sampled and tested, additional viral families are included, and the limits of viral detection increase.",

Additional discussion of the 50 novel viruses is provided in the supplemental material. Here, we discuss a number of important limitations that must be considered in the interpretation of these results. First, the use of consensus PCR limits surveillance and discovery to viruses related to those targeted in these assays. Second, variations in virus concentration can also influence the probability of detection. Third, we evaluated the diversity of viruses in a limited set of compartments and tissues, and unbiased sequencing was not used as a secondary method of capturing diversity. The classification of viruses is also significant, as redefining the genetic limits between one virus and another would change the total number and prevalence of viruses discovered and would impact our estimations of viral richness.

It is also unknown why these viruses should so readily coexist, though ecological mechanisms such as simultaneous transmission (codispersal), the availability of requisite resources, and/or shared benefits associated with host immunomodulation by one or more of these viruses may explain the observed cooccurrence. Recombination is also a possible consequence of coinfection and is a common feature in the ecology and evolution of herpesviruses (30\u201336).

These two viruses are very closely related, and we speculate that cooccurrence may offer little benefit to the viral population because of increased competition for resources coupled with minimal potential for fitness gains via recombination. Even though previous studies showed a lack of immune recognition in betaherpesviruses (37), we suggest this might act as an effective mechanism for reducing the coexistence of closely related viruses by preventing sequential infections. Such a mechanism would not completely preclude cooccurrence due to codispersal and would therefore serve to explain why some codetections were still observed between these two viruses.",

These included two human bocaviruses (PgBoV-1 and -2), an avian adenovirus (PgAdV-2), a human/bovine betacoronavirus (PgCoV-3), and an avian gammacoronavirus (PgCoV-4). In each case, these viruses were only observed once and showed strong phylogenetic association to viruses found in humans, birds, or ruminants. The interface by which these viruses were able to move from these disparate hosts into bats is unclear. However, on several occasions, we have observed P. giganteus in Bangladesh drinking from bodies of water (rivers and ponds) that are used by people, livestock, domestic animals, and wildlife for drinking, bathing, and in some cases, sewage, and we hypothesize that shared water sources may be a source of exposure. Viral spillover (and/or host switching) is an example for which the concept of virodiversity in defined animal host populations might be particularly important. Such processes precede many emergence events (3, 38); however, there is almost certainly additional asymptomatic movement of viruses between hosts, the frequency and impact of which remain poorly understood.",

If annualized over a 10-year period, the discovery of 85% of mammalian viral diversity would be just $140 million/year, which is both a one-off cost and a fraction of the cost of globally coordinated pandemic control programs such as the \u201cOne World, One Health\u201d program, estimated at $1.9 to 3.4 billion per year, recurring (64). While these programs will not themselves prevent the emergence of new zoonotic viruses, they will further contribute to pandemic preparedness by enhancing our understanding of viral ecology and the mechanisms of disease emergence and by providing sequences and other insights that reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic impact of emerging infectious diseases by expediting recognition and intervention.",

This included urine (n = 926), throat swabs (n = 806), feces (n = 78), and roost urine (n = 97). All samples were collected by trained veterinarians, and all animals were released unharmed. Samples were collected directly into lysis buffer (bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc.) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until transfer to the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University. Roost urine samples were also obtained by suspending 3- by 2-m polyethylene sheets underneath roosting colonies, which collected urine (with possible fecal contamination) from the bats roosting above. Total nucleic acid was extracted from all samples using the EasyMag (bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc.) platform, and cDNA synthesis performed using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen), all according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Viral discovery was performed using broadly reactive consensus PCR assays targeting coronaviruses (49), paramyxoviruses (50), astroviruses (51), influenza A viruses (38), adenoviruses (52), polyomaviruses (53), bocaviruses (54), and herpesviruses (55). Consensus primers for hantaviruses were modified from an existing protocol (56) in order to increase the degeneracy of the assay, and the assay validated for its ability to detect diverse hantaviruses, including Andes, Puumala, Sin Nombre, Prospect Hill, Seoul, and Thottapalayam hantaviruses. The modified primer sequences were UHantaF1 (GWGGVCARACWGCHGAYT) and UHantaR1 (CCWGGTGTDADYTCHTCWGC) (expected amplicon, 250 bp), and the annealing temperature was 52\u00b0C.

We focused instead on collections of viral sequences that form distinct monophyletic clades within a particular family, and we considered a virus novel if the sequence identity to its closest relative is less than or equal to the identity between the two closest species for a given viral family. Due to the very large number of herpesvirus sequences identified in this study (n = 650), we used hierarchical clustering to segregate sequences for this particular family. To do this, we first extracted 598 polymerase sequences from published complete genomes (downloaded from NCBI on 14 September 2012) and combined them with the sequences generated in this study (total of 1,248 sequences). Coding sequences were translated and aligned using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) (57) with the default settings. The nucleotide alignment was constructed by replacing each amino acid with the codon that gave rise to it. Columns containing gaps in more than 1,000 of the 1,248 sequences were removed. The genetic distance between HV species was subsequently established using the published sequences in the alignment only, as described previously (58), and a >7% nucleotide difference (Hamming distance) was used to define HV clusters. PgHV sequences were then segregated using hierarchical clustering, as implemented in the SciPy package (59) using average linkage clustering.",

The basic mechanism of species detection occurs from drawing samples by collection from some larger assemblage (61). In this context, our samples are as described above, urine, throat, fecal, or roost urine taken from an individual bat or bat roost, which represent the biomes for our assemblage of interest. These methods require the assemblage of viruses under sampling to be closed for valid inference, that is, that the assemblage size and composition remained stable throughout the course of the study, an assumption we felt was justified. Although each of these sample types targets a unique biome of potential viral habitat from the host species, each with potentially differing efficacy for detecting any given virus, for the purposes of our analyses, we considered each sample a random and equivalent draw from the assemblage of viruses associated with this host species. We also assumed sample independence, even though multiple samples (e.g., urine and throat) were often drawn from the same individual host and sampled bat populations are likely to be geographically nonrandom. The consequence of this sampling strategy is that our analysis is blind to this additional source of geographical variation and occasional pseudoreplication, which means our virus accumulation results are specific to our sampling methodology and our extrapolations assume ongoing sampling with a similar average composition of samples. The results of additional analyses in which we isolated sample types and individuals and considered geographic variation are not presented herein.",
