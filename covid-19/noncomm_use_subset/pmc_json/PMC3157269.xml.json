This disease is characterized by anorexia, increased late-term abortions, increased number of stillborn pigs, mummified fetuses, weak live-born piglets, increased pre-weaning mortality, and delayed return to estrus 2. In vivo, PRRSV productive infection occurs predominately in alveolar macrophages of the lung 3, followed by viremia and subsequent interstitial pneumonia within 3 days 4. It was hypothesized that respiratory pathology, especially lung damage during PRRSV infection, results from an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs 5.",

This systematic analysis of the pulmonary gene expression profiles suggested that upregulation expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during PRRSV infection processes 6. Another high-throughput deep sequencing was performed focusing on the pulmonary gene expression profiles after a highly pathogenic-PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain infection 7. The system analysis of the pulmonary gene expression provides a comprehensive basis for better understanding the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV 7. Because PRRSV infection occurs predominately in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) 3, the interaction between PRRSV and PAMs have been studied systematically by high-throughput research methods in vitro. PAMs, lavaged from six piglets, were challenged with the Lelystad PRRSV strain in vitro, and the gene expression of the PAMs was investigated using Affymetrix microarrays 8. The result suggested that the expression of beta interferon 1 (IFN-\u03b2), but not of IFN-\u03b1, was strongly upregulated in the early stage of PRRSV infection 8. Besides microarray, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was also employed to examine the global expression of genes in PRRSV-infected PAMs in vitro 9. These studies have provided global gene expression profiles of lung tissue in vivo and PAMs in vitro following infection with PRRSV; however, transcriptome-wide understanding of the interaction between PRRSV and PAMs in vivo has not yet been established.",

In this study, laboratory infection was performed in Tongcheng piglets (a Chinese indigenous breed living in Tongcheng county of Hubei province) using PRRSV stain WUH3 11, a highly pathogenic PRRSV isolated in China during the pandemic period of HP-PRRS in 2006. We also employed Affymetrix microarrays to investigate the gene expression patterns of PAMs isolated from the piglets after infection.

Twelve 5-week-old Tongcheng boars (a Chinese indigenous breed) were obtained from three litters (four piglets per litter), and raised in pathogen-free facilities. To perform a paired experiment, individuals within a full-sib litter were separated into two groups: one infected group and one control group with 6 piglets in each group. The infected groups were challenged with PRRSV-WUH3 (3 ml/15 kg, 10-5 TCID50/ml) by intramuscular inoculation. Slaughters were carried out at 0 day post-infection (dpi) for uninfected (control) groups, and at 5 or 7 dpi for infected groups. Rectal temperature and clinical signs were recorded daily during the experiment. The serum samples for viremia detection were collected daily from all animals (one ml blood per sampling point).

The lung damage caused by the infection was regional and mild at 5 and 7 dpi (Figure 1C and D), but further observation for a longer period of time was not performed in this study. The slow reproduction rate of the virus (viremia) at 3 to 7 dpi (Figure 1B) suggested a near balance between the viral replication and the defense mechanisms in the PAMs. Transcriptomic analysis of the PAMs at 5 dpi identified 321 DE genes under the filter of 1.5-fold change, and the number of upregulated genes (219) was greater than that of downregulated genes (102). In comparison, an in vitro transcriptomic analysis of PAMs revealed that only small numbers (no more than 100) of DE genes (threshold of 1.5-fold change) were identified at 1 to 12 hours post PRRSV infection, and the overall effect of PRRSV on the host transcription machinery was downegulation 8. It is not sure whether there is a conversion of the overall effect of PRRSV on host transcription machinery from downregulation to upregulaton as time goes on, or the change is only the effect of the difference between in vitro and in vivo assays. As compared with the number of DE genes in this study, some thousands of DE genes (threshold of almost 1.5-fold change) were identified in lung tissues at 4 and 7 dpi following both PRRSV and HP-PRRSV infection, by high-throughput deep sequencing assays 6, 7. This great number of DE genes might result from the huge amount of data obtained by the deep-sequencing method and from the many cell types in lung tissues.",

The induction of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, but not IFN-\u03b1 mRNA, is observed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and primary alveolar macrophages infected by PRRSV at 12 dpi 8, 37. In some cases, even the expression of IFN-\u03b1 can be detected in the lung 38 or serum 39 of pigs infected with PRRSV during the early days. Interestingly, in this study, no induction of type-I IFN was detected in PAMs at 5 dpi (Figure 3), whereas a series of IFN induced genes that are critical for the cell to defend itself against viral infection, were upregulated (Table 2). Similar results were shown in lung tissues at 4 and 7 dpi following both PRRSV and HP-PRRSV infection 6, 7, and it was speculated that the IFN induced genes were predominantly expressed by the uninfected cells 7. Here, another possibility is suggested that a certain amount of type-I IFN might be induced at the early stage of the infection before 5 dpi.",

Recently, zinc ion has been reported to efficiently inhibit the RNA-synthesizing activity of the multiprotein replication and transcription complex of both SARS-coronavirus and equine arteritis virus 40. Upregulation of SLC39A14 (also known as Zip14) (Table 3), a member of the SLC39 (Zip) family which transports zinc from the extracellular space or organellar lumen into the cytoplasm 43, might be a defense mechanism in PAMs during HP-PRRSV infection. Nevertheless, none of the SLC39 family genes was identified as a DE gene in a microarray assay of PAMs infected with PRRSV in vitro 8. Furthermore, the expression of SLC39A7, another member of the SLC39 family, was downregulated in the lungs of Landrace\u00d7Yorkshire crossbred piglets at 7 dpi following HP-PRRSV infection 7.",

Besides, the complement system is one of the key players in the defense against infections. However, excessive activation of the complement can also exaggerate the disease induced by viral or bacterial infection. In 2009, a new H1N1 influenza A virus caused severe disease in naive middle-aged human individuals with preexisting immunity against seasonal strains, and this disease is reported to be induced through high titers of low-avidity nonprotective antibody and immune complex-mediated complement activation in the respiratory tract 44. Excessive complement activation can contribute to organ damage in combination with the cytokine storm in the later stages of sepsis caused by bacterial infection 45. It is reported that blocking complement activation can ameliorate hepatic inflammation mediated by the hepatitis C virus core protein 46. Likewise, inhibition of complement with a potent C3 inhibitor (compstatin) in a baboon model of late-stage sepsis markedly improves organ preservation and other clinical parameters 47. As it has been shown here, inhibition of the complement system might also be a contributor to the mild regional lung damage during HP-PRRSV infection. Interestingly, infection of HP-PRRSV in six-week-old crossbred weaned pigs (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire) induces complement activation accompanied by severe lung damage 7.",

Microarray analysis revealed that HP-PRRSV infection has affected PAMs in vivo in expression of the important genes involved in cytoskeleton and exocytosis organization, protein degradation and folding, intracellular calcium and zinc homeostasis. Several potential antiviral strategies might be employed in PAMs, including upregulating IFN-induced genes and increasing intracellular zinc ion concentration. Furthermore, inhibition of the complement system likely attenuated the lung damage during HP-PRRSV infection. This system analysis could lead to a better understanding of the HP-PRRSV-host interaction, and to the identification of novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine tolerance/susceptibility to HP-PRRS.",
