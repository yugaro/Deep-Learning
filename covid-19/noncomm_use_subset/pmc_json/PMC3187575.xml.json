These membranous structures range from small spherular invaginations in mitochondria or endosomes and lysosomes (e.g., nodaviruses and togaviruses, respectively) to massive rearrangements of the secretory pathway (e.g., nidoviruses and flaviviruses). Despite these differences in origin and morphology, these structures are thought to reflect a common advantageous strategy that may in fact serve multiple purposes. Confining replication sites within membranous structures could help, for instance, to ensure the proper topological orientation and concentration of the different components required for viral RNA synthesis and to shield viral RNA products from the sensors of the cellular innate immune system (1, 3).",

Such a diversion of membranes could explain the strong inhibition of the anterograde transport from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi complex caused by enterovirus infection (14, 15). Additionally, enterovirus replication is extremely sensitive to treatment with brefeldin A, a well-known inhibitor of the secretory pathway (16, 17). Consistent with this membrane origin, ER and Golgi markers have been detected in enterovirus replication structures (10, 18, 19).",

The fact that, depending on the particular EM study, they were visualized as either single- or double-membrane structures is particularly intriguing. Furthermore, the technical approach has thus far been limited to conventional two-dimensional (2-D) EM. Electron tomography (ET) (24) allows a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) analysis of viral replication structures, as illustrated by recent studies for other positive-strand RNA viruses (25\u201330). These works revealed new structural details (e.g., connections and openings) that have important mechanistic implications for the overall organization of the replicative cycle. In this study, we set out to investigate the membrane structures induced by the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) at different stages of infection, using a combination of advanced cryofixation methods and serial ET. Our results document a variety of CVB3-induced structures that appear at different time points after infection, reveal their detailed 3-D architecture, and provide the basis for a model in which early single-membrane structures are transformed into late DMVs and multilamellar structures.",

Both dsRNA and nonstructural proteins were first detectable at 4 h postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A). By 5 h p.i., not only had the percentage of visibly positive cells increased significantly, but also nonstructural protein expression levels were clearly elevated relative to 4 h p.i. (Fig. 1A and B). Western blot (WB) analysis on cell lysates confirmed this substantial increase in the amounts of 3A and 3D from 4 to 5 h p.i. (Fig. 1C). During the next two hours, the number of positive cells continued to increase slightly (Fig. 1A). Notably, approximately half of the positive cells showed severe cytopathic effects by 7 h p.i., while at 8 h p.i. the vast majority of cells had gone into demise (data not shown).",

In this stage, most tubules are tightly packed in domains where they adopt a similar orientation (Fig. 3B). Parts of ER (Fig. 3B, blue) were often found in proximity to CVB3-modified membranes, but connections between the two were never detected in any of our tomograms, and in agreement with previous observations (5, 7), ribosomes were not detected on any of the virus-induced structures. The length of individual tubules, which occasionally branched in two, was highly variable, ranging from around 300 nm to more than 1 \u00b5m (average, 654 \u00b1 292 nm, n = 22), whereas their width was quite consistent (maximum diameter, 81 nm \u00b1 7 nm). We sometimes observed short, lateral membrane continuities that connected two tubules (Fig. 3C). This raised the question of whether the observed clusters could actually form an interconnected network, as described for some other groups of positive-strand RNA viruses (26, 27). However, a thorough analysis of the tomograms revealed that the majority of the tubules (around 75%) constituted individual, unconnected entities, and no more than two tubules ever appeared to be interconnected. It should be noted, though, that this analysis is limited by the anisotropic resolution that is typical of ET, since connections perpendicular to the third dimension cannot be resolved (24). Nevertheless, at most this effect would account for only a minor fraction of undetected connections. Therefore, our observations make the existence of an interconnected tubular network highly unlikely and instead are consistent with a superstructure of individual tubules that cluster together through homotypic interactions (Fig. 3D).",

Although their size often exceeded the thickness of the sections, our serial tomography approach allowed us to examine complete structures. With this method, tomograms of the region of interest are obtained in successive serial sections and joined in a single, larger reconstruction (24). The vesicles were then assigned to a particular class depending on their architecture (Fig. 4A and B; also, see Movie S2 in the supplemental material). The 3-D analysis demonstrated that the elaborate multilamellar structures (Fig. 4B, red), despite their various shapes and degrees of complexity, in all instances contained only one closed inner vesicle delimited by a double membrane. These inner DMVs were enwrapped by one or several layers of curved cisternae, which often engulfed most of the DMV but remained open to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4D and E). The spherical shape of these DMVs appeared to be distorted by the enwrapping process.",

Whereas pairing of the tubular walls by interaction of the inner surfaces would help to flatten a tubule, membrane curvature needs to be induced to produce the round DMV shape. These predicted intermediate structures, which would be better described as cisternae, were indeed present in our tomograms (Fig. 5B to D). The combined effect of curvature and pairing would eventually result in a rounded-up cisterna enwrapping cytoplasmic space. In this stage, the curved cisternae would be indistinguishable from an open DMV in a vase-like configuration (Fig. 5E). Fusion of the membrane ends would then account for the transition into a closed DMV with tightly apposed membranes (Fig. 5F). This enwrapping mechanism can also explain the formation of other structures apparent in our tomograms, such as tubules engulfed by open DMVs or by layered cisternae (see Movie S4). Likewise, the multilamellar structures typical of the late infection stage could just be the result of an analogous enwrapping process of DMVs by cisternae and, therefore, would also be ultimately derived from the original tubular structures.",

One of these is whether these structures exist as single- or double-membrane compartments, an issue that has important mechanistic implications. Whereas a single-membrane vesicle can simply form from its membrane donor organelle through a budding mechanism, a more complex process is required for the genesis of a DMV (3, 31). The observations of open DMVs in 2-D EM images previously suggested an enwrapping mechanism, analogous to autophagosome formation, and a possible role of the autophagocytic pathway in enterovirus replication (10, 20). However, this was difficult to reconcile with studies showing single-membrane structures, with viral proteins and newly synthesized RNA on their surfaces, budding from the ER (7).",

Our results establish that both single- and double-membrane compartments are characteristic CVB3-induced membrane alterations whose relative abundance is correlated with the infection stage. This newly discovered time dependency provides an explanation for the discrepancies between previous reports on enterovirus replication structures. Single-membrane tubular clusters occur predominantly early in infection (Fig. 2A, 2A\u2032, and 3), whereas the number of DMVs increases as infection progresses (Fig. 2B, 2B\u2032, and 4). Importantly, similar observations have been made recently in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells in an independent study (G. A. Belov, V. Nair, B. T. Hansen, F. H. Hoyt, E. R. Fischer, and E. Ehrenfeld, submitted for publication), which suggests that this phenomenon is general for enteroviruses and independent of the specific cell line. In addition to these compartments, we detected a third type of modification, the multilamellar structures (Fig. 2C and C\u2032), which are typical of the late phase of infection. The basic structural unit of these complex structures is a DMV tightly enwrapped by one or several apposed cisternae.",

Nevertheless, such an initial budding event was not detected in our tomograms, which seems to indicate that it may be a fast process that is completed in the early phases. Proteins of the entire secretory pathway as well as autophagy markers have been detected in enterovirus replication structures (10, 11, 18, 19, 32), suggesting that several cellular pathways may be involved in their generation. In light of our results, it is tempting to speculate that the different pathways may play a role during different stages of infection as the replication structures evolve. An in-depth immuno-EM study of host and viral markers (including viral RNA) at different time points, which is beyond the scope of this work, will be necessary to elucidate this.",

In the overall process, the enteroviral 2BC and 3A proteins must be key players, since their coexpression generates membrane structures that mimic those observed during viral infection (20). Importantly, 2B and 2C both contain an amphipathic \u03b1-helix (33\u201335), a well-known curvature-inducing motif (3). Also, recruited host factors may well play a role in membrane remodeling (18, 19, 36). Elucidating the mechanistic details of the formation and transformation of enterovirus replication structures will be one of the challenges for future investigations. In any case, the mechanisms must be essentially different from those that generate the replication structures of nodaviruses, togaviruses, and flaviviruses. Rather than protrusions, the latter are invaginations into mitochondrial, endo/lysosomal, and ER membranes, respectively, with a neck-like connection to the cytosol (25, 27\u201329). From this point of view, the replication structures of enteroviruses are more similar to those of nidoviruses, which have also been reported to generate DMVs in infected cells (31, 37, 38). However, in light of our results, important topological differences between the two groups are apparent, since CVB3-induced DMVs are isolated compartments, whereas our previous 3-D studies on nidoviruses established that, in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and equine arterivirus, the DMVs are actually interconnected, forming a large reticulovesicular network continuous with the ER (26, 39).",

In comparison, the scenario for enteroviruses looks conceptually simpler, since the replication complex has been reported to be situated on the cytosolic face of the membranous structures (7, 40), consistent with the membrane topography of the nonstructural proteins thought to assemble into the replication complex (41\u201343). We show here that the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis occurs relatively early, coinciding with the predominance of single-membrane tubules, strongly suggesting that these are the essential structures supporting viral RNA synthesis. Accordingly, pulse-labeling and autoradiography experiments performed early in infection pinpointed the active replication complex to the outer surface of single-membrane structures (7). Nevertheless, since DMVs appear to be derived from the tubular structures, it seems plausible that they could also support viral RNA synthesis.",

When the multilamellar structures emerge, the replicative cycle of the virus is almost complete: progeny virions have already been produced, and the cell is going into demise. Notwithstanding the fascinating complexity of these structures, they could well be the by-product of the membrane-remodeling activities operating during the initial phases. As for the unwrapped DMVs, the reasons for their formation remain mysterious. The DMVs induced by poliovirus were postulated to mediate nonlytic release of progeny virus particles (44). Although this process would account for only a minor fraction of the total progeny viruses released after cell lysis, it might promote viral spread within the infected host.",
