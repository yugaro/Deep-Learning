Published shortly after ICAR, a multi-author report entitled \u2018Highlights of the 30th International Conference on Antiviral Research\u20191 gave an overview of a broad range of the ICAR presentations. In contrast, this meeting report gives detailed accounts of the lectures by the recipients of ISAR\u2019s three major awards, held in memory of Gertrude (Trudy) Elion, Anton\u00edn (Tony) Hol\u00fd and William (Bill) Prusoff, the presentation by the first ISAR Women in Science (WIS) awardee and the four Keynote addresses. Following the suggestion by Joe Colacino, a previous ISAR President, I have added my own personal comments within the \u2018My personal comments and Conclusion\u2019 section.",

In the USA, during the period 1999\u20132007, the burden of mortality with viral hepatitis due to HBV had been falling steadily (from six to four per 100,000 each year) whereas that due to HCV was rising (three to over four per 100,000 each year). In the same period, the mortality due to HIV was less than one per 100,000 each year. HCV has genotypes 1\u20136, genotype 1 being the most common in North and South America, Europe, Australasia and some parts of Asia, genotype 3 being most common in South Asia and all genotypes being found in differing proportions through Africa. When considering the prospects for finding a cure for HCV-infected patients, the high rates of HCV replication (10e12 virions/day) and viral mutation (0.1\u20131 error per viral RNA synthesised) were seen as presenting a huge challenge. However, there was one aspect which offered hope; there was no known viral reservoir.",

Also, the highly active, critical nature of the polymerase active site means that any mutations resistant to nucleoside/tide drugs are likely to reduce polymerase efficiency and hence the fitness of the mutated virus and hence reduce the probability of generating highly resistant virus. When Mike joined Pharmasset, the standard-of-care HCV therapy was IFN together with ribavirin (RBV) which could not be used without IFN. The cost was high, in terms of dollars, time (one year) and in severe restrictions on patient lifestyle. Also, the outcome was uncertain, the cure rate being around 40%. But Pharmasset had an early lead compound, PSI-6130 (Figure 2).",

In collaboration with Roche, a prodrug approach was started with the aim to increase bioavailability and, if possible, decrease the conversion to the uridine metabolite. This programme led to RG7128. In a 14-day monotherapy Phase II study in HCV GT1 non-responder patients, there was a 2.7 log10 reduction in HCV RNA levels. In a four-week combination study (RG7128 (1000 or 1500 mg bid) with pegylated IFN and RBV), there was \u223c 90% response rate with safety comparable to the corresponding placebo control. Certainly, this was an encouraging result but the high doses and the twice-daily dosing regimen were of concern which were unlikely to be overcome by the prodrug approach. So was there another option? Why was the uridine metabolite (PSI-6206) inactive? The Pharmasset team decided to try a different approach.",

Both the cytidine and the uridine TPs inhibited the HCV polymerase but the uridine TP was the less potent as assessed by their inhibition constants (Ki), 0.42 and 0.06 \u00b5M, respectively. However, the half-life (T1/2) of PSI-6206-TP was much longer than that of PSI-6130-TP (38 and 5 h, respectively). The 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily.",

Because the phosphates carry a charge, they remain trapped within the cell. [Phosphoramidate prodrugs were first introduced by Chris McGuigan, a former President of ISAR.] Although the phosphoramidate approach is well known, there are side chains which can influence the properties of the prodrug. In addition, this approach in the past never demonstrated clinical efficacy and the concept of liver targeting using phosphoramidates was never contemplated. [In his Elion Award lecture at the 2015 ICAR, Phil Furman described how over 140 phosphoramidate prodrugs of PSI-6206 were synthesised and how PSI-7977 was selected to become sofosbuvir (Figure 3).

Although with slightly less activity, l-BHDU inhibited two other herpesviruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV, glandular fever/infectious mononucleosis) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (cold sores). Against these herpesviruses, l-BHDU was more active than the positive control, ACV. In contrast to the known anti-VZV compound, bromovinyl-deoxyuridine (BVdU), l-BHDU does not interfere with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolism. This became an important toxicity issue when BVdU and 5-FU were co-administered to cancer patients. In a VZV animal model, l-BHDU (150 mg/kg) was markedly more effective than valacyclovir (200 mg/kg).",

With adefovir, the resistance was much less, at about 30% after five years but a better treatment was needed. With entecavir and tenofovir, the resistance levels remain very low, just a handful of patients having resistant virus.

Acidification of the endosomal compartment triggers structural changes in E leading to its reorganisation and refolding as a post-fusion trimer (E3). These structural changes in E bring the endosome and viral membranes in close enough proximity to fuse, leading to formation of a fusion pore through which the viral genome can escape into the cytoplasm. In this fusion process, E acts as a catalyst in that it lowers the energy barrier for membrane fusion, but it has no classical active site to which an inhibitor can be rationally targeted. In addition, although each virion has 180 copies of E (90 pre-fusion dimers) that can reorganise as 60 post-fusion trimers, it has been unclear how many of these copies of E must be bound by an inhibitor to prevent fusion.

For the primary antiviral assay, cells were infected with dengue virus serotype 2, the compound added 1 h after infection and the assay read at three days, to allow inhibitors of every step in the viral life cycle, including viral spread, to be identified. In secondary screens, time-of-addition experiments were performed, including experiments in which compound treatment was restricted to a preincubation of the viral inoculum and the initial 1 h infection period. This enabled identification of three chemical series, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines, 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidines and cyanohydrazones that all appeared to inhibit dengue virus entry via binding to a target present in the viral inoculum. Medicinal chemistry efforts were used to improve the initial lead compounds, leading to inhibitors including 1-100-1 (4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine), 7-148-6, 2-12-2 (2,4-diaminopyrimidine) and 3-110-22 (cyanohydrazone) that had 90% effective concentration (EC90) values in cell culture between 2 and 10 \u00b5M. Medicinal chemistry was also used to generate derivatives containing biotin and fluorophores, which were used to demonstrate binding to pre-fusion, E2, rather than to post-fusion, E3. An in vitro fusion assay monitoring pH-triggered fusion of virions to synthetic liposomes was used to demonstrate that all three compound series inhibit E-mediated fusion. To establish where these compounds bind on E2, virus was serially passaged in the presence of inhibitors to select for resistance mutations. Up to passage 9, no resistance was detected with three of the compounds but resistance to 7-148-6 was obtained at passage 4, due to a single mutation, E-M196V, located in the detergent-binding pocket. This mutation reduces the affinity of recombinant E for all three series of inhibitors. The mutation T171A located in domain I away from the pocket also confers resistance to compound 3-110-22, but does so without affecting the affinity of the E-3-110-22 interaction. Additional point substitutions in the pocket were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. These were introduced to the pocket (Q52A, F193L, M272S, L277M and F279S) by site-directed mutagenesis and the impact of each of these substitutions was assessed by measurement of Kd values against each of four compounds (3-110-22, 7-148-6, 2-12-2, GNF-2 and 1-100-1). The compounds were all affected by mutations in the pocket but \u2018footprints\u2019 of inhibitors in the same structural class were more similar to each other than to compounds in the other structural classes.

When growth in culture was achieved, it was shown that, unlike RV-A and RV-B, it uses the cellular receptor, cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3).

Since 2006, RV-C has been shown to be the primary cause of asthma exacerbations and viral pneumonia in infants. In a clinical study, RV-C was detected in 60% of children with asthma exacerbations versus 24% with either RV-A or RV-B, 14% with another virus without RV and 8% with no virus detected.

In the 1988 baseline year, there were about 350,000 cases/year in 125 countries \u2013 by the 2000 target year, there were less than 3000 cases. Each year, this low number of cases has continued to decline, there being just five cases in two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) so far this year (April 2017). Initially, the oral vaccine (OPV), containing attenuated viruses of the three serotypes, was widely used because its administration was so easy. It was highly effective in reducing the number of new cases. Although most vaccinated subjects clear the attenuated virus, a small reservoir of virus was identified in immunocompromised subjects. As the number of polio cases have declined in a particular area, the oral vaccine has been replaced by the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), thus avoiding the creation of potential new virus reservoirs. However, IPV supply shortages are a problem. OPV remains in use in most countries.",

For comparison, this mutation rate is faster than that for HIV, influenza viruses and HCV, viruses generally considered to be rapidly evolving. Most mutations will generate synonymous codons that do not alter the protein coding. However, the few, critical, attenuating mutations in OPV are under negative selection pressure to revert towards the wt. Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) have been defined on the basis of threshold divergence in the VP1 capsid protein, There have been a few vaccine-associated paralytic polio cases, about 1\u20132/1,000,000 (cf. 1/200 from wt virus). Various types of immune deficiency can lead to prolonged virus shedding (>6 months) but severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) can result in chronic shedding (>5 years). One individual has been shedding poliovirus for >30 years. Regardless of paralysis status, VDPV in immunodeficient subjects (iVDPV) has been identified as a major threat to polio eradication, especially in those countries that do not have a good medical system. In countries from which poliovirus has been eliminated for many years, the chronic excretors have largely either cleared the virus or died. For example, in the UK there is just one individual alive and still excreting virus after 32 years. In the USA, there may be none remaining, with one potential case lost to follow-up.",

For individuals with low VL (102\u2013103), intermediate VL (103\u2013105) and high VL (>105), the proportion retaining more than 300 CD4 cells/mm3 were 100%, about 25% and virtually 0%, respectively. Indeed, the high VL group reached the end point within three years (p = <0.001). In a similar study comparing individuals infected with low vRC, intermediate vRC and high vRC virus, the latter also lost CD4 cells more rapidly with only \u223c25% with CD4 count > 300. In contrast, 50% low vRC individuals retained CD4 cells above 300. To determine if this detrimental effect of higher vRC was simply an effect on VL, individuals infected with low and high vRC viruses, but with similar set point VLs (3.8 and 4.0 log10), respectively, were compared.

This suggests that a vaccine for Zika virus may be possible \u2013 certainly, the medical need is high. Generally, inactivated vaccines and subunit vaccines have a better safety profile than live attenuated vaccines. However, the later may give lifetime immunity after a single dose, a feature that Pei-Yong considered critical for a successful Zika vaccine. He has considered two possible approaches to produce an attenuated vaccine with a good safety profile; to knockout a key viral enzyme or to delete sections of the three prime untranslated region (3\u2032UTR). His target enzyme was methyltransferase, which enables the Zika virus to acquire a cap to protect the viral RNA. The active site was inactivated by changing two amino acids. In the 3\u2032UTR approach, he compared vaccines with 10-, 20- and two different 30-nucleotide deletions. Rather unexpectedly, the 10-nucleotide deletion (10-del ZIKV) seemed to be more attenuated than both a 20- or 30-nucleotide deletion vaccines. This may be due to the 10-del ZIKV being more susceptible to IFN than the other deletion vaccines \u2013 the reason for the differing IFN responses is not known. The 10-del ZIKA vaccine was the focus of the remainder of his ICAR presentation. The initial evaluation was done in a mouse model using type 1 IFN receptor-deficient A129 mice. To study the protective effect provided by vaccination in pregnant mice, C57BL/6 mice were used. Studies on male mice used A129 mice. Then safety and efficacy were confirmed in rhesus macaques.",

Although the uridine analogue (PSI-6206-TP) was less potent than the cytidine analogue (PSI-6130-TP) as an inhibitor of the HCV polymerase, the half-life (T1/2) of PSI-6206-TP was much longer than that of PSI-6130-TP (38 and 5 h, respectively). The 38 h half-life would enable PSI-6206 to be administered once daily. The second crucial decision was to select the half-life as the more important parameter, the reduced activity as being of less importance. A prodrug approach was initiated to maximise activity, synthesising and evaluating many phosphoramidate prodrugs in order to select the best candidate drug.

Although it limits HBV DNA effectively, it neither eliminates viral cccDNA nor the production of VPs transcribed from cccDNA. In this situation, compounds targeting VP production, and thereby allowing the restoration of the host immune response, require compounds with good activity and safety profile but not necessarily with a high genetic barrier because such compounds will always be used with TAF.",

It has been confirmed that small molecules can interact with E to give activity in both a target-based assay and a cell culture antiviral assay. The next step is to validate E as an antiviral target in vivo. Although it is necessary to confirm antiviral activity, it is also necessary to show that this approach can lead to antiviral compounds having a high genetic barrier to resistance. It was an encouraging start to find that some compounds did not show resistance up to passage 9. However, I think that Sophie Duraffour holds the record for ICAR\u2019s longest resistance test, with resistance to (S)-HPMPDAP appearing in two strains of camelpox virus after passaging 30 times, taking 18 months, before resistant clones could be obtained. (Sophie Duraffour, 22nd ICAR, 3\u20137 May in Miami Beach, FL, USA). To investigate resistance to dengue, Priscilla\u2019s group prepared various dengue mutant viruses containing point substitutions, which were chosen from naturally occurring E sequences identified in public databases. None of the current compounds were active against all these mutant strains. Surely, that suggests that, for these compounds, resistance will be a critical factor to be investigated.",

Hugh Field8 and I devised the term \u2018back door escape route\u2019. We illustrated the concept using the HIV protease. When treating an HIV patient with a single PI, the first (primary) resistance mutation will decrease the inhibition by the antiviral drug but perhaps by a small degree. Then other mutations (secondary) will further decrease the inhibition by the drug. These mutations are usually near the active centre of the protease. Further mutations (tertiary) may be remote from the active centre and may not decrease the inhibition of the drug but restore some of the lost functionality of the protease. By carful combination of PIs with different resistance mutations, it may be that none of the spontaneously arising mutant proteases can be both resistant to the drugs and be a competent enzyme \u2013 the \u2018front door is locked\u2019. However, there is a \u2018back door escape route\u2019 \u2013 the viral RNA encoding both the protease and that for the cleavage sites (the protease substrate) can co-mutate so that both the enzymic activity and the substrate change. The altered protease is no longer inhibited by the PIs, it has \u2018escaped through the back door\u2019. The \u2018back door escape route\u2019 is not available to the viral polymerases because the natural nucleotides are absolutely required for building the viral DNA/RNA. Hence, careful combinations of nucleoside/tide analogues have given the drug therapies with the highest genetic barriers.",

I consider it optimistic to expect the inhibition or blocking of a host protein will give an antiviral therapy that is free from viral resistance problems. Although the target host protein may not be subject to change, the virus may well be able to use a \u2018back door escape route\u2019. Priscilla Yang\u2019s team may find that is so for their antiviral approach. To my mind, the important result from her work is a good demonstration that antiviral compounds, which maybe not good enough for clinical use, are effective tools to learn more about viral replication. Her compounds have given more information about the dengue virus fusion process. I recall discussing with my friends from Roche at the 1999 ICAR (Jerusalem) the use of their HSV thymidine kinase inhibitors to investigate how an initially (immature) latently infected cell can mature to become a competent latently infected cell from which HSV can reactivate. Shortly afterwards, that work was closed down but the opportunity still remains. I ought to declare an interest in such an investigation into herpesvirus latency \u2013 famciclovir appears to act like a thymidine kinase inhibitor, preventing immature latently infected cells maturing8 (and references therein).",

Douglas (Doug) Richman, in his Elion Lecture at the 29th ICAR in La Jolla,7 reported clinical studies which indicated that both EFdA (a nucleoside analogue inhibiting HIV RT) and cabotegravir (an HIV integrase inhibitor) could be administered by injection at long time intervals.
