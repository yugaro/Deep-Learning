Thus it is no surprise that, at present, the vast majority of European countries do not yet have a formal system for educating respiratory physicians, at a specialty level, on the knowledge and skills considered essential in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of respiratory infections. Furthermore, European countries have very different resources dedicated to the continuing development of respiratory professionals.",

Members of ERS Assembly 10 (respiratory infections) and national experts were asked to complete an online questionnaire, which was then processed by the ERS office. The results were presented to the task force for more detailed discussion. The decisions derived from these consultations were integrated into the next Delphi round (Delphi 1). It is to be noted that although the same respondents were contacted in each round, there was a drop off in the number of responses between rounds. Respondents were asked to rate in terms of agreement whether sections should be included (mandatory or optional) or excluded. A Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was chosen to ensure measurement reliability over the three different Delphi rounds. Agreement was operationalised through a majority of responses in the top two points of the scale (measured as the sum of frequencies of agree and strongly agree responses). In Delphi studies consensus is considered a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for agreement concerning the inclusion of items [6]. The iteration of rounds was also required to establish the stability dimension for agreement. Stability was defined as \u201cthe consistency of responses between successive rounds of a study\u201d [7]. Both consensus and stability dimensions were investigated in the study.",
