Oropharyngeal swabs and bloods samples were taken in cases. One week after enrolment, symptoms and signs were evaluated by phone call in all cases.

Antecedents of fever had to occur within 24 hours before enrolment. Respiratory symptoms included cough, thoracic pain, sore throat, dyspnoea, chest indrawings, tachypnoea, cyanosis, and rhinorrhoea. Tachypnoea was defined using the WHO definition of a respiratory rate >60 breaths/min in children <2 months of age, >50 breaths/min in children 2 to 12 months of age, and >40 breaths/minute in children \u2a7e1 year of age.3 Tachycardia was defined as >160 beats per minute (BPM) for infants <2 years of age and >140 BPM for children 2 to 12 years of age.25 Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) suggestive for severity of disease was defined as \u2a7e50 mg/L.26,27 Leucocytosis was present if leucocytes are increased to more than 11 000/mm3. Pneumonia was defined using the WHO guidelines as tachypnoea with cough and/or dyspnoea.3 Alarming signs were defined as tachypnoea, chest indrawing, or hypoxemia.",

Most of the co-detections in our study were caused by S pneumoniae combined with influenza virus A. In a review by Brealey et al, the prevalence and clinical significance of co-detections in children with ARTI were studied. They found a similar prevalence to what our study shows. After adjusting for pathogens significantly related to illness, no relation was detected between the presence of a co-detection and illness in our study, which means that we did not detect a synergic effect in co-infection, possibly due to a small sample size.",

Furthermore, selection bias could have occurred, because no matching was done. The average age of controls is lower than the average age of children with a respiratory infection, probably due to the young age of children enrolled in vaccination programmes. However, we did not discern significant heterogeneity regarding pathogens in different age groups (except for the mentioned differences in prevalence of RSV) or living areas. Another limitation is the use of only throat swabs. The nasopharyngeal swab is found to be superior in detecting influenza virus, S pneumoniae, and Moraxella species, but oropharyngeal swabs are superior for the detection of M pneumoniae and H influenzae.47-50 It is preferable to use both techniques, but limited resources inhibited that. There was a lack of a gold standard such as chest X-ray for pneumonia. By taking a clinical definition of ARTI, there is possible overlap with other feverish diseases such as malaria and gastrointestinal illnesses. Other limitations are the short duration of the study and a lack of follow-up data of patients due to nonresponse to phone calls. We might have missed data on severity of illness and hospitalizations.",
