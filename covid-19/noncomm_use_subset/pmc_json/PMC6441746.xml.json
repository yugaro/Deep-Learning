It is now classified into three major histologic patterns: capillaritis, bland hemorrhage, and alveolar bleeding due to other conditions (eg. infection, pulmonary embolism). In DAH with capillaritis, there is profound neutrophil infiltration into the peri-capillary and pulmonary interstitial spaces. In bland pulmonary hemorrhage, there is leakage of blood into the alveoli without evidence of inflammation and in alveolar bleeding from other causes, there is minimal inflammation with evidence of another primary process. Typically patients with DAH present with cough, hemoptysis, alveolar infiltrates, and hypoxemia. Some patients do not have hemoptysis because alveolar surface area is large and blood can be resorbed. The diagnosis of DAH is classically made by bronchoscopic alveolar lavage with increasing bloody return on each subsequent lavage [2].",

Chest x-ray was unremarkable (Fig. 1a). He was given a diagnosis of viral upper respiratory infection and dehydration, and discharged from the Emergency Department in haste, as he needed to \u2018catch a flight to Hawaii\u2019 per hospital documentation. However, he returned later that day with severe dyspnea. Vital signs included maximum temperature to 102.7 \u00b0Fahrenheit, heart rate 131 beats per minute, respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, blood pressure 94/40, and arterial oxygen saturation was 55% on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula. He was emergently endotracheally intubated and copious bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube were noted. Other abnormalities included mild elevation of transaminases and total bilirubin, acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dL with protein and blood on urinalysis), rhabdomyolysis (creatinine kinase 2811 U/L), abnormal coagulation profile (prothrombin time 16.9 s, partial thromboplastin time 29 s, international normalized ratio 1.4), leukocytosis (18.3 K/l), anemia (hemoglobin 7.0 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia (96 K/ \u03bcl). CXR showed development of interstitial opacities (Fig. 1b). Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oseltamivir were initiated empirically at the community hospital, to cover for usual bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and influenza.",

Bronchoscopy revealed severe erythema and inflammation of mucosa with increasing blood secretions returned with each bronchoalveolar lavage.

Past medical history was notable only for Bells palsy as a child due to Lyme disease, and he had received recommended childhood vaccinations. He had flown to Maryland from HI, and then driven to Vermont with a friend to ski and they had skied \u2018hard\u2019 for five days. They stayed in a cabin, which according to the friend was clean and otherwise unremarkable. Contact with medical personnel and military officials from his unit provided an accurate travel history for the antecedent 6 months of military service, which cannot be detailed here. However, we were able to confirm that he had not traveled recently to the Middle East or any areas with endemic malaria. Based on areas traveled, mild liver involvement, and the short list of infectious causes of DAH in immunocompetent patients, leptospirosis and dengue fever were suspected. Influenza remained a possibility also as the presentation occurred during influenza season, though all military members on the ship had received annual influenza vaccination. Tick-borne illnesses, while unlikely causes of DAH, were also considered based on travel to Vermont (though seasonality was not consistent). S. aureus pneumonia also was a possibility, made less likely by the presence of viral prodrome unless it had occurred as a complication of influenza. Family history was unknown as the patient had been adopted from Romania at birth, and there were no known sick contacts or disease outbreaks on his submarine.",

He had participated in the \u201cWarrior Dash\u201d in Hawaii. The event consists of fourteen outdoor obstacles, several of which involved full body exposure to mud or fresh water. Consistent with clinical suspicion, IgM for Leptospira was positive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Hawaii Department of Health (HI DOH) Disease Investigation Branch were made aware, and they provided confirmatory testing. A four-fold increase in IgM titers from acute to convalescent phase, as well as PCR positive for Leptospira interrogans serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Mankarao, further bolstered the diagnosis. The dominant serovar in HI is icterohaemorrhagiae; therefore transmission likely did occur while the patient was in HI, during participation in the \u2018Warrior Dash\u2019 two weeks prior to symptom onset. The presence of serovar mankarao is consistent either with co-infection or with cross reactivity on testing. Per HI DOH, there were no other known cases occurring in association with this event.",

Cases of leptospirosis can occur worldwide but are classically associated with tropical and subtropical regions [5]. Of the states in the USA, Hawaii has the highest endemicity [6] and was the initial clue to the diagnosis in this case. Exposure to contaminated water, soil, and other matter places several populations at risk-- rural animal or vegetable farmers, slaughterhouse workers, flood victims, soldiers, and urban sanitation workers or children exposed to rat urine in garbage or alleyways. Based on the various presentations and patterns of exposure, the human form of this disease has gone by many names: Weil\u2019s syndrome, hemorrhagic jaundice, swineherd\u2019s disease, Fort Bragg fever, swamp fever, mud fever, autumn fever, field fever, rice-field fever, cane-cutter\u2019s fever, and canicola fever [5]. Improved sanitation and mechanization of agriculture decreased rates of this disease, with epidemic leptospirosis disappearing in the 1960s. Global climate change has now been implicated in its reemergence beyond classic geographic boundaries [[7], [8], [9]]. The epidemiology is changing in another way also-- outbreaks associated with recreational water sports have been increasingly documented [[10], [11], [12]]. Chemoprophylaxis for participation in water sports has been suggested by some but remains controversial [2,12].",

In this case, the presence of DAH significantly narrowed the differential diagnosis, and exposure to mud and fresh water in HI were important epidemiologic clues that suggested Leptospirosis. Treatment should include penicillin, doxycycline, or a third generation cephalosporin [15,16]; this patient received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 10 days and did recover.",

Comparatively, a recent description of LPHS patients in an endemic region revealed a mortality rate of 65.5% with standard care [20]. It therefore would be reasonable to extrapolate that the use of ECMO in severely ill patients with LPHS may reduce mortality. The timely coordination of care between the community hospital and the tertiary care center intensive care unit with ECMO capability played a major role in the successful outcome in this case.",

The importance of obtaining epidemiological data on travel and exposures cannot be understated. Anyone engaging in recreational water-based activities in areas endemic for Leptospira spp. should be made aware of the potential risks. Further research on the role of chemoprophylaxis is needed, especially as the cases of leptospirosis become more common in traditionally non-endemic areas due to climate change. Additionally, this case highlights the potential benefits of ECMO in LPHS and of streamlining transition of care from community hospitals to tertiary care centers for patients requiring advanced support strategies such as ECMO.",
