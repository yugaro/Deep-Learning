By January 27, 2020, 2823 cases were confirmed, with 81 deaths. To date, there have been a few reports of chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Here, we report chest CT findings in two patients confirmed with 2019-nCoV pneumonia at Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital.

The 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that includes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1234). Most early patients had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. The source of infection is thought to be wild animals, possibly the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) (5678). Transmission of 2019-nCoV is mainly via droplets but can also be through contact. People are generally susceptible to the 2019-nCoV infection and the elderly patients or those with underlying diseases are more seriously affected. The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is generally 3\u20137 days but no longer than 14 days, and the virus is infective during the incubation period. The main symptom is fever with a temperature > 38\u2103. Other symptoms include fatigue, dry cough, and diarrhea, and acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in severe cases (910).",

In case 2, the percentage of lymphocytes and CRP levels were normal, although this difference may be attributed to the milder symptoms of this patient. As a result, this case was prone to misdiagnosis in the clinic. However, 2019-nCoV pneumonia was diagnosed in case 2 based on the characteristic CT findings, which were further confirmed using positive results of the timely rRT-PCR analysis.",

In the SARS outbreak in 2003, infected patients exhibited rapid progression of lung lesions, with both lungs showing diffuse infiltration within a short period and producing \u201cwhite lungs\u201d and mediastinal emphysema (1112). In contrast, these lung lesions are relatively mild and are easily misdiagnosed as bronchopneumonia or any common viral infection. In addition, no obvious fibrosis was found in these cases, which may be related to the short course and mild intensity of the disease in these patients; this speculation remains to be confirmed using subsequent large-scale studies.",
