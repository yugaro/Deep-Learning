About 25 different supplements including chitosan, squalene and others are approved as supplementary health foods, and they have been sold as medicine or food. The term \"health food supplements\" used until 2002 is now currently converted to \"health functional foods.\" This term is used interchangeably as dietary supplements in the United States, food for specific health use in Japan, and food supplements in Europe.1 Even though accurate statistics have not been available in Korea, the scale of Korea's health functional food market was estimated to be worth 3.9 trillion won in 2011. Some reports have suggested that sharp rise in demand for health functional foods has been observed as external environmental factors such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have increasingly drawn much attention since 2008. Red ginseng is one of the most widely consumed health functional foods, in addition to multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and others. The most commonly consumed food is red ginseng, followed by multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and aloe in women in the 50's.2 The amounts of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C, as well as omega-3 and omega-6, consumed are found to show a decreasing trend in Korean postmenopausal women as they age.3 This study is aimed to review four health functional foods most commonly consumed by women in the 50s.",

Fresh ginseng is a term used to refer to ginseng plant that has been cultivated for less than 4 years. While ginseng is usually grown for 4 to 6 years, peeled and then dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less. White ginseng may contain less of the therapeutic constituents. Red ginseng is made from 6-year-old fresh ginseng that is steamed at 100\u2103 and then sun-dried. Through this process, ginseng starch begins to gelatinize, increasing the amount of saponin content. Therefore, red ginseng is more widely used as herbal medicine compared to white ginseng. The pharmacological action of red ginseng is mostly generated by ginsenosides, known as ginseng saponins, and polysaccharides. In addition, polyacethylenes, sesquiterpenes and peptidoglycans are identified to have pharmacological effect.4",

Moreover, red ginseng is believed to improve immune function, physical performance and sexual function, and manage cancer, diabetes (DM) and hypertension. In a study of Hwang et al.5 1 g/kg of red ginseng was given to mice orally daily during two weeks of exercise. Consequently, fat oxidation during the initial exercise period significantly increased in the red ginseng group compared to the non-red ginseng group. Furthermore, the liver glycogen stores significantly decreased immediately after the one-hour exercise but compared to at rest in the red ginseng group, but did not differ between immediately after the one-hour exercise and at rest in the red ginseng group. These findings suggest that the administration of mice with red ginseng during two weeks of exercise boosts fat oxidation and has glycogen-sparing effect, and red ginseng is involved in delaying peripheral fatigue during exercise.5",

This study was performed to examine whether esophageal and gastric cardia cancers were reduced in patients with esophageal dysplasia that appeared to be a precancerous lesion. According to the results, although multivitamin supplementation did not decrease the incidence of esophageal, gastric and other cancers and cerebrovascular disease and mortality rate in overall, mortality rate was reduced in the group administered with selenium, vitamin E and beta carotene in combination compared with other groups administered with other components.13 During the 10-year follow-up after stopping multivitamin and mineral supplementation, the effect of combined administration of selenium, vitamin E and beta-carotene persisted in reducing mortality rate, but this effect lasted only in subjects aged below 55 years.14",

Major types of omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-6 fatty acids include linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA). Mammals require the two essential fatty acid, ALA and LA to yield more bioactive derivatives through elongation and desaturation, and longer chain derivatives, EPA and DHA as well as AA can be obtained through oral intake of diet.23 LA is elongated and desaturated to form AA which encourages the production of proinflammatory cytokines, setting the stage for inflammation. ALA is elongated to EPA and DHA which are major components of the phospholipid membranes of the brain and retina and have anti-inflammatory effect.24 Omega-3 rich foods are salmon, herring, anchovi, sablefish, whitefish, tuna and others. Common vegetable oils have a higher content of omega-6 than omega-3. Although flaxseed, canola, mustard, walnut, soybean and other vegetable oils are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vegetable oils abundantly contain ALA and have low levels of EPA or DHA. Since the conversion of ALA contained in vegetable oil to DHA or EPA is very inefficient, there is weaker evidence that ALA intake decreases cardiovascular events compared with DHA or EPA. Thus, it is almost impossible that taking flaxseed oil may influence cardiovascular disease progression.22 The mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids may reduce risk for cardiovascular disease are thought to be attributable to lowered serum triglyceride levels and antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activities.24",

Glucosamine naturally found in all human tissues is particularly found at high concentrations in connective tissues, and at highest concentration in articular cartilage.34 Glucosamine is made in the body from glucose using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the amine from glutamine. However, most glucosamine supplements are made from chitosans obtained from crustacean sources prepared using sulfate. After oral administration of glucosamine sulfate, 90% is absorbed and helps to build articular cartilage. Glucosamine exists in a number of different forms including sulfate, hydrochloride, N-acetyl-glucosamine, chlorohydrate salt, and as a dextrorotatory isomer, but it remains controversial which form is most effective. Glucosamine sulfate has showed effective clinical results to date, but many clinical studies have reported ineffectiveness of glucosamine sold in other forms.35 Even though the potential mechanisms of glucosamine are known to be direct stimulation of chondrocytes, incorporation of sulfur into cartilage, and protection against degradative processes, the exact mechanism is unclear.36 In addition, the effect of glucosamine in the treatment of osteoarthritis still remains controversial.",
