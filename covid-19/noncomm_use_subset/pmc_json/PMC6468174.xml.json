            "text": "Historically, vaccines have had enormous impact on human health, eradicating smallpox, polio and many other childhood and adult infections of public health concern. Worldwide, attention is now turning to the task of vaccines for these emerging and re\u2010emerging pathogens, with renewed interest and support from international governments, the World Health Organization (WHO) and organizations such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and philanthropic organizations such as the Gates Foundation. This review series sets out to survey the progress to date. In their article, Afrough, Dowall and Hewson 1 review a range of emerging viruses and make the case for applying molecular techniques to understand viral pathogenesis. The authors discuss the exploitation of vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non\u2010replicating viral vectors; they suggest that the use of viral vector platforms should accelerate progress, as the insertion of a gene for a new antigen allows rapid targeting of newly emerging diseases. They point out, however, that despite 50 years of research and the preclinical evaluation of many vaccine candidates for the Lassa fever virus, for example, that no vaccine has yet been approved and suggest that economic factors such as the lack of a commercial market have impeded progress. There needs to be concerted international action to overcome the regulatory hurdles to bring vaccines for these emerging pathogens into clinical use.",

            "text": "Understanding the interaction of the host with a viral pathogen to expedite vaccine development is a theme taken up in the review contributed by Sharpe et al.\n2. Specifically, they address the targeting of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)\u2010E molecule, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1b molecule, by viral vectors to induce non\u2010classical CD8+ T cell immunity and to inhibit natural killer (NK) cell activity. However, the authors acknowledge that there remain some questions of safety with this HLA\u2010E targeting approach to vaccination; for example, the existence of self\u2010peptides which are able to up\u2010regulate HLA\u2010E activity. The preclinical data, for example for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), is promising and the authors conclude that if viral\u2010vectored vaccines can also be developed to induce HLA\u2010E\u2010restricted T cells in human patients, this could lead to vaccines with broad, fast\u2010acting and appropriately targeted immunogenicity and efficacy.",

            "text": "This review series also includes articles on bacterial pathogens, such as the Burkholderia species, which cause significant morbidity. Morici, Torres and Titball 3 address progress in the development of vaccines for melioidosis, a bacterial disease which causes an estimated 165 000 human cases per year, with a mortality rate which can reach 40% where there are co\u2010morbidities, such as diabetes. This disease occurs in tropical areas of the globe, with a high incidence in northern Australia and South East Asia, where the disease is considered endemic. The causative agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, has multiple virulence mechanisms, including efflux pumps, which effectively confer antibiotic resistance. The authors describe the need for multiple components in a vaccine for melioidosis in order to defeat the secretion systems and other virulence mechanisms that this bacterium possesses, as well as the heterogeneity of B. pseudomallei strains. In the last decade, progress towards efficacious candidate vaccines has been made and is comprehensively reviewed here. However, while initial protection against exposure is achievable in preclinical models, the inability so far to induce sterilizing immunity to B. pseudomallei remains a challenge.",

            "text": "New technologies for vaccine formulation and administration would be advantageous in the context of rapid vaccination on a large scale to curtail disease outbreaks. In their article, Wallis, Shenton and Carlisle 4 review novel approaches for the design, delivery and administration of vaccines. The authors consider a range of vaccine formulations and presentations (e.g. virus\u2010like particles, conjugate vaccines, liposomes, live attenuated vectors) and parenteral (conventional and novel such as transdermal aided by ultrasound) administration routes. They discuss the potential for self\u2010administration of vaccines (e.g. by oral and intranasal routes). Additionally, the need to target the immune system appropriately to induce both serological and cellular responses in systemic and mucosal compartments has been considered. In this context, the review by Miquel\u2010Clopes et al. \n5 focuses on vaccines which are designed to induce mucosal immunity to protect mucosal surfaces (principally the respiratory, inhalational, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts) from pathogen invasion. The authors review the handful of mucosal vaccines for either human or veterinary use which are already licensed. They make the case that the use of effective vaccine delivery systems and the avoidance of immune tolerance induction are essential factors in the development of vaccines inducing mucosal immunity. This is a theme to be expanded in the second part of this review series, where there will be a review of current developments in oral vaccine delivery technologies, and the selection of appropriate preclinical models to determine vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy and from which to derive immune correlates of protection. The latter are required to understand the mechanism of action of candidate vaccines and to identify potential surrogate markers of vaccine efficacy, to apply to clinical trials. Additionally, potential pathways will be discussed for regulatory approval of vaccines for emerging pathogens.",
