To date, 59 ADNSHL genetic loci have been mapped, and 36 causative genes have been identified (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/). Based on the type of gene product, these genes can be categorised into several groups of encoded proteins such as those involved in the structure and function of hair cells, the auditory nerve and virtually every structural element of the inner ear. The pace of gene discovery has accelerated with the increased availability of high throughput sequencing techniques.",

After filtering out low-quality and duplicate reads, clean data were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. After alignment, variants were called using four types of software (SOAPsnp, GATK, Samtools and Platypus), merged into variant call format files and annotated using a variant effect predictor, including those with minor allele frequencies (MAF), in public databases and the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in-house databases. We used ExomeDepth software to detect the CNVs of this pedigree. By setting the parameters and following the instructions, we obtained rare CNVs from exome sequencing data. Under the assumption of autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, only variants that were heterozygous in the four affected siblings and absent in the two unaffected individuals were selected as candidates and verified using PCR-Sanger sequencing.",

The affected individuals reported a progressive nature of hearing loss, which was verified with audiograms. While affected family members initially had normal low-frequency hearing, their hearing loss became progressive and ultimately deteriorated at all frequencies by the fourth or fifth decade (figure 1E). There were no indications of a relationship between hearing loss and infections or noise. Result of ABR and DPOAE excludes auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders. All affected individuals did not complain of imbalance, and no abnormalities were found in a detailed vestibular analysis. The affected individuals had no obvious delay in gross motor development and no indications of visual problems or morphological features to suggest a syndromic form of hearing loss. High-resolution CTs of the temporal bone in affected individuals were normal, excluding inner-ear malformations.",

These variants were shared by the four cases and were absent from two controls. In the 21.45 MB region, After the PCR-Sanger sequencing, we found two variants, c.296G>A (p.Arg99His) (figure 1D) and CDC20 c.1436G>A (p.Arg479Gln), that cosegregated in the phenotype and genotype in this pedigree. All nine affected individuals were heterozygous for these mutations. We further expanded the BGI in-house database and checked the frequency of the two variants. CDC20 c.1436G>A (p.Arg479Gln) was carried by eight individuals who were diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa but reported no hearing loss. IFNLR1 c.296G>A was absent from 2896 in-house controls in Chinese population. We detected an average of 346 CNVs per sample, but none met the genetic model of this pedigree. PCR-Sanger sequencing of the variant in 500 normal-hearing controls having the same genetic background revealed no carriers of IFNLR1 c.296G>A (p.Arg99His) and this residue is conserved in all vertebrates, from zebrafish to mammals (figure 1C).

An antibody directed against the heavy chain of neurofilament (NF200), which was used to specifically stain nerve fibres and neurons, revealed colocalisation of NF200 with Ifnlr1 in the cochlear nerve fibres and spiral ganglion neurons (figure 2D,E). A magnified imaged of Ifnlr1 expression in the organ of Corti revealed high expression of Ifnlr1 in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of most cells, although their distributions in these cells were somewhat variable. In contrast to the expression of Ifnlr1 in cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of IHCs, Ifnlr1 was negative in the nucleoplasm in OHCs (figure 2C,H\u2013J).

In this study, we found broad expression of Ifnlr1 in the inner ear, including sensory and non-sensory epithelia of the organ of Corti, cochlear nerve and spiral ganglion of the cochlea and in the crista ampullaris of vestibular organ. To exclude the non-specific reaction of polyclonal antibiotics, we applied two polyclonal antibiotics against mouse Ifnlr1 from different companies (Bioss and Abcam) and the results demonstrated similar Ifnlr1 localisations. In the affected individuals of family JS4842, DPOAE and ABR were absent, excluding the possibility of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders. Although Ifnlr1 was expressed abundantly in both the cochlea and the vestibulum in mice, the affected individuals of the JS4842 family showed no symptoms of vestibular dysfunction. Despite the wide tissue distribution of IFNLR1, IFNLR1 missense mutation identified in this study only influenced hearing, as additional clinical signs outside the auditory system were absent in the affected individuals. Such an observation is not unusual; non-syndromic hearing loss is associated with mutant alleles of several ubiquitously expressed genes such as ILDR1 (MIM 609739), TPRN (MIM 613354), MARVELD2 (also known as TRIC, MIM 610572), HGF (MIM 142409) and ACTG1 (MIM 102560).17\u201321 Whether hearing impairment is due to disruption of IFNLR1 function in hair cells, supporting cells, cochlear nerve or all of these remains to be addressed in future studies.",

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the identified IFNLR1 mutation is responsible for autosomal-dominant hearing impairment: (1) IFNLR1 c.296G>A completely cosegregated with hearing loss in an ADNSHL family; (2) the identified mutation influenced the conserved residue of the IFNLR1 protein and in silico analysis suggested that this mutation disturbed protein function; (3) the identified mutation was absent in 3396 ethnically matched controls (2896 in-house controls and 500 controls with normal hearing); (4) Ifnlr1 was expressed in the inner ears of mice and (5) ifnlr1 knockdown induced hair cell and supporting cell loss in zebrafish. Further research is needed to address the spectrum and prevalence of IFNLR1 mutations in ADNSHL families of different ethnicities, the various functions of the different IFNLR1 isoforms and possible ligands and interaction partners. Further characterisation of the exact molecular mechanisms by which genetic defects in IFNLR1 cause non-syndromic hearing loss will contribute to our understanding of the essential processes for normal hearing, which might lead to the development of therapeutic interventions.",
