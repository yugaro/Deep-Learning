            "text": "Single administration of mouse mAb 2\u20134 improved the survival time and quality of life of\ncats with FIP [4]; however, single administration did\nnot exhibit a therapeutic effect in some cats. It is known that single administration of an\nanti-fTNF-alpha drug is unlikely to exhibit a therapeutic effect on cats with FIP; thus,\nseveral administrations of mAb 2\u20134 are necessary for treatment. However, several\nadministrations of mouse mAb may induce anaphylactic reactions, as described above.\nMoreover, mouse mAb is a xenogeneic protein for cats, suggesting that a feline anti-mouse\nantibody response is induced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2\u20134, decreasing the reactivity\nagainst fTNF-alpha and thus reducing the therapeutic effect. The possibility of feline\nanti-chimeric antibody production similar to the production of anti-mouse mAb 2\u20134 antibody\ncannot be ruled out due to the variable region of chimeric mAb 2\u20134 being derived from mouse\nprotein. Thus, the induction of feline anti-mouse antibodies in cats treated with mouse and\nchimeric mAb was investigated. As the feline anti-mouse antibody was increased in serum, the\nfTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mAb 2\u20134 was reduced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2\u20134\nand 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2\u20134. That is, no neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2\u20134\ninduction was observed in cats treated with 1 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2\u20134, suggesting that feline\nanti-mouse antibody induction was prevented by modifying mouse mAb 2\u20134 to chimeric mAb 2\u20134.\nAccordingly, repeated administration of chimeric mAb 2\u20134 may not decrease the therapeutic\neffect in cats. However, in cats receiving 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2\u20134 administration, the\nneutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2\u20134 was induced after the 2nd administration,\nstrongly suggesting that chimeric mAb 2\u20134 also induces production of neutralizing antibody\nagainst chimeric mAb 2\u20134 when administered at a high dose. A decrease in the therapeutic\neffect of infliximab due to production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb has\nsimilarly been reported [7]. However, neutralizing\nantibody against chimeric mAb production can be inhibited by concomitant administration of\nan anti-inflammatory drug, methotrexate (MTX). MTX suppresses the humoral immune response\nand is thought to reduce production of antibody against chimeric mAb after infliximab\nadministration [10, 11]. Concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2\u20134 may also inhibit\nproduction of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb. Future studies are necessary to\ninvestigate the applicability of concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2\u20134 in\ncats with FIP.",
