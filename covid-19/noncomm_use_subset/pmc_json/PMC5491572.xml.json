These data lead to the belief that this disease is due to multiple factors that interact with each other. Among the most prominent are genetic factors that can condition patients to have a certain susceptibility to COPD. For example, deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) (responsible for inhibiting proteases, whose function is to deplete the extracellular matrix) is present in at least 1% of the carriers of the disease in Europe and the United States and other regions around the world such as Africa and Australia.3",

Among them, ICAM-1 overexpression stands out, where, for example, rhinoviruses are anchored and more easily enter epithelial cells, favoring infection.41 It has been described in several studies that the functionality of NK lymphocytes in patients with COPD is severely diminished, which leads to a greater propensity for virus infections (rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, etc.), causal agents of a high percentage of exacerbations in this type of patients. The low antiviral activity is due, in large part, to the inhibition of the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, in addition to the low production of enzymes such as perforins, so they cannot eliminate the cells already infected by virus, so that the infection continues its course without having a response that attenuates it.56",
