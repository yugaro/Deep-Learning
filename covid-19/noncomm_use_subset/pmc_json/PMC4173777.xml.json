            "text": "The order Nidovirales encompasses a diverse group of viruses that includes significant veterinary and human pathogens (1\u20136). These viruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild enteric infection to severe respiratory disease or hemorrhagic fever (7, 8). Examples of disease-causing nidoviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a number of other coronaviruses that cause typically mild respiratory disease in humans, and agriculturally important animal pathogens, such as equine arteritis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and yellow head virus. Nidoviruses are characterized by their overall genome architecture, distinct pattern of gene expression, and presence of a conserved set of functional domains in their nonstructural polyproteins. The nidoviruses cluster into five major groups, which have been taxonomically categorized into four families: Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Coronaviridae. Viruses in the Coronaviridae family (subfamilies Torovirinae and Coronavirinae) have the largest known RNA genomes, an attribute thought possible because of a virally encoded proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that increases replication fidelity (9\u201312). Although nidoviruses are known to infect mammals, birds, fish, and crustaceans, no nonavian reptile nidovirus has been previously described.",

Native to West Africa, these snakes make popular pets because of their relatively modest size (\u22641.5 m), docile behavior, and ease of care. Selective captive breeding has resulted in a tremendous variety of colors and patterns (morphs), many of which command high prices. Since the late 1990s, veterinarians have been aware of respiratory tract disease as a common syndrome affecting ball pythons. This syndrome is often characterized by pharyngitis, sinusitis, stomatitis, tracheitis, and a proliferative interstitial pneumonia. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics suggested an infectious etiology.",

Although TEM of the lung suggested a viral etiology, traditional molecular diagnostic methods did not identify an agent. Metagenomic sequencing was used to identify and assemble the genome of a novel virus in the order Nidovirales.

Hyperplastic alveolar cells completely proliferated over capillary beds that are normally distributed at the surface of the primitive faveoli (Fig. 2C and D). Epithelial cells were tall and columnar with abundant apical mucus production (mucous metaplasia). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and alcian blue staining were positive, consistent with the presence of mucopolysaccharides. Heterophils, lymphocytes, and in some cases macrophages infiltrated the interstitium of the pulmonary septa (Fig. 2D) and often were seen in air passageways along with sloughed epithelial cells. In deeper areas of the faveolar spaces, the lung was histologically normal. In more severe cases, the proliferative changes occurred diffusely throughout the lung and were seen from the proximal to distal surfaces lining faveolar structures.",

These particles were observed within ciliated and mucous epithelial cells overlying smooth muscle bundles at the tips of faveolar septa and alveolar type II cells lining faveolar spaces of both snakes (Fig. 3A). The particles corresponded to stages of a virus with both circular and bacillary (elongated rod-shaped) nucleocapsids and were seen within electron-lucent areas of the cytoplasm. At a higher magnification, bacillary nucleocapsids contained a lucent core that was surrounded by fine granular cytoplasmic material (Fig. 3B). The uncoated intracellular capsids measured 10 to 12 nm. Nucleocapsids lined up along membranes of cytoplasmic vesicles of uncertain origin, and as they progressed into a vesicle, a membrane coat was acquired (Fig. 3C). Cross sections of mature virions having a lipid envelope and surface spikes were also identified in cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3D). Bacillary virions were observed within vesicles subadjacent to epithelial cell membranes on the free cell surface (Fig. 3E) and extracellularly between cilia and microvilli projecting into the air passageway (Fig. 3F). The mature particles measured approximately 50 by 180 nm. In some sections, filamentous bacteria (200 nm by 200 \u00b5m) were occasionally observed between cilia and closely associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 3F).",

We then used a stepwise analysis pipeline to efficiently identify possible pathogen-derived sequences. First, we removed low-quality and low-complexity sequences and trimmed adapter sequences from reads. For each library, identical reads were collapsed to yield sets of unique sequences. Next, we filtered out snake ribosomal sequences and sequences aligning to the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21).

The data set from snake 2 had the most nidovirus-like sequences: 92 read pairs with BLASTx alignments to nidovirus protein sequences with an expect (E) value of \u226410\u22123 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). These sequences were used to seed targeted de novo genome assembly using the PRICE metagenomic assembler (22), which produced a draft assembly of what appeared to be the complete viral genome of 34.5 kb (Fig. 4A). Sanger sequencing of the entire genome and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were used to validate the assembly and to confirm that it contained the proper end sequences (Fig. 4B) (23\u201325). We used the Bowtie2 software alignment tool to retrospectively map paired-end reads to the draft genome assembly and found it to be well supported by deep sequencing data (26, 27). Coverage levels were even across the genome, and read pairs generally mapped concordantly (Fig. 4C and D). We found that the deep-sequencing-based assembly represented nearly the entire genome, except for 165 bases of 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) sequence, which were determined by 3\u2032 RACE. This genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (see below).",

ORF1a is translated to produce the pp1a polyprotein. A fraction of translating ribosomes undergo a \u22121 frameshift near the end of ORF1a, resulting in the continuation of translation though ORF1b and the production of the pp1ab polyprotein. This virus is likely to utilize a similar mechanism of translation. ORF1a and ORF1b are offset by a \u22121 frame difference and overlap by 52 nt. This overlapping region contains a putative \u201cslippery\u201d sequence (AAAAAAC) that may be the site of frameshifting (Fig. 4A; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) (35, 36). In this virus, pp1a is predicted to be a 5,803-amino-acid (aa) protein with a molecular mass of 663 kDa, and pp1ab is predicted to be 8,108 residues long with a mass of 925 kDa (Fig. 4E).

We first queried the snake virus pp1ab sequence against the NCBI nr database using the BLASTp tool. The best alignments produced were to pp1ab sequences from viruses in the Torovirinae subfamily, with bafinivirus sequences producing slightly higher scoring alignments than did torovirus sequences. The best alignment was to the pp1ab sequence of fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV) (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) (40). This alignment covered nearly the entire second half of pp1ab in 2 contiguous pieces from residues 3973 to 5060 and 5429 to 8029 of snake virus pp1ab. In these regions, the polyproteins shared 22% and 29% pairwise identities, respectively. Thus, the overall organization and domain content of the second half of the snake virus\u2019s pp1ab protein resembled most closely those of bafinivirus replicase polyproteins (see Fig. S3).",

The expected domains present in snake virus pp1ab included a 3C-like protease located between two predicted transmembrane regions near the end of pp1a (TM2-Mpro-TM-3), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a helicase (Zn-Hel), a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN), a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribunuclease (NendoU), and a ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase found at the carboxy terminus of pp1ab (O-MT) (Fig. 4E and Table 2) (12, 37, 38, 43, 44). The replicase polyproteins of some taxa of nidoviruses encode a guanine-N7-methyltransferase (1, 9, 43, 45). As is the case for viruses in the Torovirinae subfamily, snake virus pp1ab appears to lack this enzyme. Functional experiments will be necessary to validate the cleavage patterns, biochemical activities, and roles in the virus life cycle of these predicted replicase proteins.",

The activity of this domain is not essential for replication in vitro but may help counteract the innate immune response in vivo (49, 50).

First, the size of the snake virus protein (215 aa) is just under the range for other Coronaviridae M proteins (216 to 268). Second, the protein contains 3 predicted TM domains in the N-terminal half, a characteristic feature (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies based on individual domain and concatenated alignments had nearly identical topologies (Fig. 7; see also Fig. S6). In these phylogenies, the 5 major groups of nidoviruses (Torovirinae, Coronavirinae, Roniviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Arteriviridae) formed well-separated branches. Ball python nidovirus (BPNV) formed a monophyletic clade with the viruses in the Torovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family. The snake virus is approximately equally distant from the two genera in the subfamily, the toroviruses, which infect mammals, and the bafiniviruses, which infect ray-finned fish (Fig. 7; see also Fig. S6). We noted in the protease alignment that two putative active site motifs previously identified by Ulferts et al. (57), one containing a histidine and a GX[S/C] G motif, aligned in all sequences. A third putative Asp/Glu-containing motif shifted drastically in alignments, even within Coronavirinae. Nevertheless, the topology of the tree generated using the protease alignment was in close agreement with other phylogenies. This analysis did not find a monophyletic grouping of the Torovirinae and Coronavirinae subfamilies of the family Coronaviridae.

Respiratory tract pathology was consistent with a viral etiology, as was the presence of virus-like particles in lung epithelium of affected snakes. Using unbiased deep sequencing, we identified and assembled the genome of a previously uncharacterized nidovirus.

Second, the virus load is most profound in the respiratory tract, the site of disease. Third, other animal nidoviruses cause severe respiratory disease. Nevertheless, formal evidence of disease causality remains to be demonstrated.

This suggests that at least for the core replicase gene, the snake virus shares a common evolutionary origin with these mammal and fish viruses. Although it has not been proven that the virus sequence corresponds to the particles observed in electron micrographs, the ultrastructural appearance and size of the observed virus are notably similar to those of virions of white bream virus in the genus Bafinivirus (61, 62). We propose that ball python nidovirus establish a new genus in the Torovirinae named Barnivirus, for bacilliform reptile nidovirus, a naming convention borrowed from the genus Bafinivirus.",

The availability of a more complete representation of existing species for comparison results in greater phylogenetic resolution (64).

Captive snake breeding operations typically operate at high stocking densities, and breeders commonly attend trade shows, where animals from different sources are juxtaposed. In addition, animals from geographically and ecologically diverse areas are commonly imported and mixed with minimal quarantine. These practices increase pathogen exposure and lower barriers to transmission. The outcome is evident in the case of farmed turtles, which typically have very high Salmonella carriage rates, in contrast to the low prevalence in wild turtle populations (66\u201368). It is also possible that these practices select for increased virulence, as has been the case for feline calicivirus (FCV), which has independently evolved multiple times from a pathogen that causes a relatively benign upper respiratory disease to one that causes hemorrhagic disease with high mortality (69). This increase in FCV virulence has been documented only in high-density environments, such as shelters. Surveillance of wild ball pythons in Africa will shed light on whether a similar phenomenon has occurred here. Further investigation of the pathogens of reptiles and improved biosecurity practices and disease surveillance of the herpetoculture industry are indicated.",

Additional studies will help to answer these central questions and uncover additional details about the biology of this putative pathogen.

Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed for 30 min at either 45\u00b0C or 50\u00b0C, respectively, and then denatured for 2 min at 94 to 95\u00b0C. For RNAs amplified according to the protocol described elsewhere (74), reaction mixtures were thermocycled 40 times at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, followed by successive incubations at 45\u00b0C and 68\u00b0C for 30 s each. For RNAs amplified according to the previously described protocol (75), reaction mixtures were treated identically except that the annealing and extension temperatures were 53\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C degrees, respectively. Positive- and negative-control reactions were carried out in parallel to validate the performance of the testing.",

The sequences of all oligonucleotides are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 42\u00b0C and then for 15 min at 70\u00b0C. Then, 1 U RNase H (NEB) diluted in 5 \u00b5l 1\u00d7 RT buffer with 100 pmol MDS-286 was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and then 94\u00b0C for 2 min. Then, primer extension was used to convert single-stranded cDNA to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA): 2.5 U Klenow DNA polymerase (3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exo-; NEB) diluted in 5 \u00b5l 1\u00d7 RT buffer with 2 mM (each) dNTP was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. DNA was purified using DNA clean and concentrator columns (CC-5; Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and using a 3:1 ratio of binding buffer/sample. The DNA concentration was determined fluorometrically, and 10 ng was used as a template in 10 \u00b5l Nextera transposon reactions, which contained 1\u00d7 buffer and 0.5 \u00b5l transposase mix (Illumina), which were incubated at 55\u00b0C for 10 min and then placed on ice. Tagmented DNA was cleaned with CC-5 columns (4:1 buffer ratio), eluted in 20 \u00b5l H2O, and used as a template in PCRs that added full-length bar-coded adapters to library molecules. PCR mixtures contained 1\u00d7 Kapa real-time library amplification PCR mix (Kapa Biosystems), 0.33 \u00b5M (each) primers MDS-143 and -445 and 0.017 \u00b5M (each) adapter1 and adapter2 bar-coded primers, and 5-\u00b5l library template. Thermocycling conditions were 72\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 30 s, and then 5 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 63\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 3 min. Relative concentrations of libraries were then quantified in quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction mixtures containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.08% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2 mM (each) dNTP, 1\u00d7 Sybr green (Life Technologies), and 0.5 U Taq polymerase, and 0.1 \u00b5M (each) primers MDS-143 and -445.

Low-quality sequences and low-complexity sequences (defined as having a ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length of less than 0.46) were removed from further analysis. The first 5 bases of each sequence were trimmed, as was the last base. The CD-HIT sequence clustering tool was then used to collapse reads with >98% global pairwise identity (77). Host-derived sequences were then filtered, first by using the BLASTn alignment tool (version 2.2.25+ [30]) to query a database of snake ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences and then by using the Bowtie2 alignment tool (version 2.0.0-beta7 [26]) to query databases composed of draft assemblies of the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21). Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10\u221212 (BLASTn) or with \u2013local mode alignment scores greater than 86 (Bowtie) were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned to the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or to PhiX-174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed on average 98% of sequences (see Table S2). The remaining sequences were searched against custom databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTx alignment tool. Sequences aligning to any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 0.25 were further examined. False positives were reduced by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair\u2019s best hit were still to viral sequences were retained. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (22). The reference assembly (NCBI accession no. KJ541759) was assembled using reads from a single snake (no. 2); other animals lacked sufficient coverage to assemble the complete genome. To validate this assembly and generate coverage and pairwise identity data, reads were aligned to Sanger validated assemblies using the BLASTn algorithm. Sequencing data have been deposited in the UCSF Integrated Data Repository.",

Amino acid substitution models were evaluated for each region using corrected Aikake information criteria in the software program ProtTest 3.2.2 (81). LG was identified as the best-fit model (82, 83). Bayesian analyses of each alignment were performed using the software program MrBayes 3.2.2 (84) on the CIPRES server (85), with gamma-distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariant sites, and amino acid models were also assessed by model jumping. The first 10% of 1,000,000 iterations were discarded as a burn-in, based on examination of trends of the log probability versus generation. Two independent Bayesian analyses were run to avoid entrapment on local optima.",
