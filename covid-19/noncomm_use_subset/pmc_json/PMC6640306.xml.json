Binding of LTA to TLR2 induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) and neutrophil influx.3,4 Bacterial cell wall components are released when bacteria are killed by autolysis or host immune cells, and are important determinants of the severity of inflammation.5 An acute breakdown of the bacterial cell wall occurs upon exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics,6 the first-line treatment for pneumococcal infections in many guidelines.7,8",

As we anticipated that the LTA and biomarker responses induced by \u03b2-lactam treatment would be spread across a broad range, we included more patients with rifampicin added to \u03b2-lactam treatment than \u03b2-lactam treatment only and randomized at a 2:1 ratio. With only four patients with pneumococcal pneumonia treated with \u03b2-lactam therapy only, this assumption was imperfect and the small group hindered comparisons. For example, in the analyses of biomarkers for inflammation, at the start of treatment, the PCT value seemed higher in the \u03b2-lactam group, while those of CRP and MR-proADM were higher in the rifampicin group. Since only three samples (one sample was missing) were available in the \u03b2-lactam group, the interpretation of these findings is difficult.",

In addition, with a median number of only one infected lung lobe, representing relatively limited pneumococcal load, the LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via TLR2 in vitro (see the Supplementary data), but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo.",

Therefore, it would have been unethical to withhold this first-line treatment from patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
