We closely monitor novel influenza A viruses, because influenza A viruses continue to evolve and because zoonotic transmission could herald an increasing pandemic influenza health threat. If a novel influenza A virus acquires the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission, a pandemic can result. Accordingly, early detection of pandemic-potential viruses may aid in the control and possible prevention of the next pandemic. Although a swine-origin influenza A virus caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,10,11 and sporadic transmission of swine-origin influenza A viruses to humans (termed \u201cvariant viruses\u201d) continue to be detected in the United States and in other countries with appropriate laboratory capacity, the public health threat posed by avian influenza A viruses appears to be higher because of their diversity and wide circulation among birds worldwide; the birds' migratory flyways may also be conducive to spread of influenza A viruses. Furthermore, some previous pandemic influenza A viruses have been partly of avian origin.11",

Signs and symptoms were nonspecific at clinical onset but progressed to include others such as sore throat, fever, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, and bleeding.43 Ultimately, there were 318 cases reported in association with this outbreak, with 280 deaths. Laboratory investigations revealed the outbreak was caused by a virus similar to Marburg virus (discovered in 1969), and it was named Ebola virus. Ebola virus is now a member of the genus Ebolavirus (in the Filoviridae family), which contains 5 related virus species: Ebola, Sudan, Reston, Ta\u00ef Forest, and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses. Since their discovery, these viruses have been the cause of more than 30 separate reported outbreaks.44 Fatality rates vary between the viruses and among outbreaks, however; for example, Reston ebolavirus infection does not cause disease in humans, only in nonhuman primates.45,46",

Signs and symptoms associated with these cases included high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding.

Cases had increased to a total of 86 cases with 59 deaths; all cases were epidemiologically linked and included healthcare workers.48 Later that March, cases began to be reported from other Guinean prefectures, including the capital Conakry, and from Liberia in patients who had traveled to Guinea prior to illness onset; additional cases began to be reported from Sierra Leone and Nigeria.",

Laboratory testing conducted at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa, consisted of testing for filoviruses, arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses, as well as for chikungunya and dengue viruses, by using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR); all tests were negative.59 However, a real-time RT-PCR for yellow fever virus produced positive results for samples from 3 of the patients. The results were reported back to the Angolan Public Health Institute on January 19, 2016, and a subsequent investigation determined that the cases had not been vaccinated against yellow fever; they had falsified yellow cards.60",
