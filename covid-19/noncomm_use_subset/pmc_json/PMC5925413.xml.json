Both ebolaviruses and marburgviruses cause severe human disease, with mortality rates of 24%\u201390%2, 3. Cuevavirus is found in bats, and whether it is infectious to humans remains unknown. Ebola virus (EBOV, species Zaire ebolavirus) is the most frequently erupting filovirus. It caused the 2013\u20132015 EBOV epidemic in West Africa, resulting in more than 28,000 suspected cases and 11,310 confirmed deaths4. The etiology of Ebola virus disease remains unclear, and new cases appeared in May 20175. Although some vaccines and drugs under study have shown effects6, 7, 8, there are still no licensed anti-filovirus agents available. Filoviruses are select agents and listed as World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogens, for which live virus research requires BSL-4 facilities9, 10, limiting the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs.",

Because of its safety, pseudovirus based on an HIV-core (pNL4-3.Luc.R\u2013E\u2013) is a powerful model for highly pathogenic enveloped viral entry studies in vitro (filovirus, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and etc.)11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The bioluminescence imaging assay is a visualizing tool that has been used for viral studies in animal models16, 17, 18. Although some Ebola virus-like particles used for vaccine studies in vivo have been reported19, 20, 21, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the comparative in vivo pharmacodynamics of filovirus entry inhibitors on different genera of filoviruses. In this study, we constructed nine pseudo-filoviruses, covering all filovirus genera, for screening of filovirus entry inhibitors in vitro, and we successfully established three in vivo mouse infection models for filovirus entry inhibitor evaluation using the pseudotyped EBOV, Marburg virus (MARV), and Lloviu virus (LLOV) as representative viruses. The robustness of this evaluation system was confirmed by the assessment of two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene22. This sequential in vitro and in vivo filovirus entry inhibitor evaluation system in BSL-2 conditions will provide powerful technical support for the development of broad-spectrum anti-filovirus agents.",

For all filoviruses, the glycoprotein (GP) is the only viral component responsible for entry, and the phylogenetic relationship between filovirus-GPs is shown in Fig. 1A. In this study, we prepared nine HIV-based pseudo-filoviruses covering all species of filovirus. The pseudoviruses were produced by co-transfection of the HIV-core (pNL4-3.Luc.R\u2212E\u2212), which contained a firefly luciferase gene, with the filovirus-GP expressing plasmid into 293 T cells. The packaged HIV/filovirus-GP virions had viral envelopes encased with filovirus-GP, which could mediate one-round viral entry into host cells, and the luciferase in infected cells could be used as a reporter for infectivity evaluation. In this system, besides the HIV/filovirus-GP virions, the HIV-alone virions, which had no envelope glycoprotein, and the HIV/VSV-G virions, with the envelope protein of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), were also prepared as the model controls. The pseudo-filoviruses infecting 293T cells yielded 6 to 8 log signals, and the HIV-alone virions and HIV/VSV-G virions yielded 2 and 8 log signals, respectively (Fig. 1B). Clomiphene and toremiphene, two known filovirus entry inhibitors, were evaluated on these pseudoviruses for system validation. As shown in Table 1, the IC50 of clomiphene on filoviruses ranged from 0.28 to 2.26 \u03bcmol/L, and the IC50 of toremiphene on filoviruses ranged from 0.13 to 3.81 \u03bcmol/L; the specificity of the compounds was confirmed by the HIV/VSV-G model (Fig. 1C and D). These results were consistent with the previously reported effects of the compounds on live ebolavirus and marburgvirus22.",

All pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed a chronological bioluminescence increase in intensity; after reaching the peak value, the intensity gradually descended. The time point at which the bioluminescence in pseudo-filovirus-infected mice reached the peak differed slightly: for HIV/EBOV-GP and HIV/MARV-GP groups, the peak appeared around 114 h post-infection (h.p.i.), i.e., the 5th d.p.i., while for HIV/LLOV-GP group, the peak appeared around 90 h.p.i., i.e., the 4th d.p.i.

The infection of host cells with HIV-based pseudovirus is a single round infection mediated by GP-receptor recognition23, and expression of the luciferase reporter gene in infected cells or organs can be conveniently used to quantify infection. These features make pseudoviruses a highly secure and efficient model for drug evaluation. Among animal models, the mouse-adapted model is the most widely used for the primary identification of antiviral drugs because of its easy operation and low cost.

Moreover, it is also difficult to achieve in vivo live virus infection models for the virus strains of low pathogenicity and the strains that could be identified only by sequencing. Furthermore, the mutated sites of virus proteins of mouse-adapted virus models might cause some drug candidates to be overlooked, especially small compounds targeting just those sites in wild-type viral proteins. These flaws could be compensated for by pseudo-filovirus in vivo models, which could directly use the identical clinically-occurring viral GP gene to construct a corresponding in vivo imaging model.
