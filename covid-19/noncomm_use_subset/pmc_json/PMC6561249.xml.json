For a few bat species, genomic (chromosomal) sequences are available, and for others, transcriptomic sequences exist. For each bat species with an annotated genome project, we downloaded the relevant RefSeq database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website and extracted the protein and coding sequence of the longest isoform of each gene for orthology search. After finding orthologous genes from each species, we selected the gene isoform which most closely matched the consensus sequence for further analysis (Methods). Genome assembly accession numbers, as well as basic assembly statistics, for each genome are given in SI Appendix, Table S1. Human, common shrew (Sorex araneus), and pig (Sus scrofa) genomes were also included as outgroups. Finally, we harvested mRNA and sequenced the transcriptomes of H. monstrosus and R. aegyptiacus on Illumina machines (Methods). For all other bats with available transcriptome data, we downloaded the raw sequencing reads from the Sequence Read Archive (SI Appendix, Table S2) (23, 27\u201338).",

Furthermore, the splits were observed to happen at sharp boundaries highly suggestive of exon boundaries. This effect can be largely explained by the fact that we chose the longest isoforms predicted from annotated genome sequences, even though the longest isoforms might not be expressed at high enough levels to appear in the transcriptomic datasets from a given tissue. Other artifacts in transcriptomic or genomic data assembly and annotation could also contribute to this effect. Quantification of this bias, based on the cleaning pipeline described below, is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S2.",

While no substitution pattern in a single column of an alignment can distinguish real biological mutations from artifactual mismatching of isoforms, runs of an alternate consensus sequence are exponentially unlikely as a function of run length according to all site substitution models, so we want to remove them before analysis. Briefly, the MIXR algorithm works as follows. First, we define the alternate-consensus-run score, designed to give high scores to runs where some subset of species is internally consistent but differs from the majority of species. We then find the maximum alternate-consensus-run score for all species bipartitions (divisions of the species into two subsets) in a given alignment, such as the bipartition into transcriptomic and genomic species in Fig. 2A. Finally, exons with significant scores are removed. See Methods for additional details.",

This is because our intention is to perform positive selection analysis on the cleaned alignments, an analysis which measures the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations. Filtering strategies based on whether the protein sequences agree will directly bias the data in favor of synonymous mutations, and the exon-length-matching and MIXR steps are expected to have this effect to some degree. However, to whatever degree this is true in our data, it will have a conservative effect, biasing the data to fewer rather than more significant hits in a positive selection analysis.",

We define unanimous second-consensus runs to be runs in an alignment where some subset of species has unanimous agreement of the amino acid sequence but disagrees with the majority of species. This is correlated with but distinct from the alternate-consensus runs defined for the MIXR algorithm as it is independent of the substitution model used for the MIXR scoring function. The results after each step of the cleaning process are shown in Fig. 2D. We see that the most significant reduction in second-consensus runs is due to the exon structure filtering step, and MIXR cleaned up essentially all of the runs which passed the previous two steps. After cleaning, only seven runs of more than three columns were detected, and those were up to only five columns in length. Furthermore, all but one of these alignments contained only species with genome data available, removing the concern of separation by data type.",

Our strategy, as expected, preferentially discriminates against more weakly conserved sites [as defined by CLUSTAL (47)], filtering >80% of nonconserved sites vs. 44% for unanimous sites, and almost all gapped sites (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, both the exon-structure filtering step and the MIXR algorithm improve sequence conservation. Fig. 2F shows the positions and distribution of conserved sites in the first 2,000 multiple sequence alignments. Many of the poor quality exons are at the ends of the alignments, which is to be expected. The ortholog finding process scores sequences based on length of agreement, which naturally tends to include matching sections in the center. The ends are then more free to vary, with variability expected due to differences in isoform selection, as well as due to incomplete or incorrect transcript assembly. Transcripts tend to have less coverage near the ends and correspondingly poorer assembly. This also helps explain why so many unanimous sites end up being filtered: correctly matched exons will still be filtered if partial assembly results in exons of different lengths. From these results, as well as manual inspection, the alignments have significantly fewer erroneous columns after exon filtering.",

We additionally fit the phylogenetic tree using RAxML with the CDS sequence of the longest 100 alignments after subjecting the corresponding amino acid alignments to manual inspection. The full length of all 100 alignments looked highly credible to manual inspection.

The traditional division of order Chiroptera into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, the large and small bats, respectively, has been challenged in recent years as molecular phylogenetic analyses have gained prominence. An alternative history has been proposed, dividing bats into two suborders named Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera (51). In the proposal, the microbat families Rhinopomatidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and Megadermatidae are joined with the megabats to form the new clade Yinpterochiroptera, while the rest of the microbats form Yangochiroptera. Our phylogeny agrees with this model, with R. ferrumequinum falling into Yinpterochiroptera (Fig. 3A). This restructuring has gained additional recent support (9, 11, 13, 15, 52), although it must be noted that the accurate rooting of ancient species groups is a notoriously difficult aspect of phylogenetics (44).",

In all of our calculated trees shown in Fig. 3B, with 100% reported posterior probability where calculated, M. leucogaster disrupts the monophyly of the genus Myotis (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). One must keep in mind, however, that the quantity of data here considered is so large it will tend to produce results with 100% reported posterior probability at each node, pushing the question of credibility further upstream to the quality of the data. No data assembly and cleaning strategy, including our own, is perfect, and it is possible that sufficient errors remain in our data as to result in an erroneous topology of such closely related species. It at first even seems suggestive, given our previous observations of bias by data type, that M. leucogaster has moved closer than expected to Myotis ricketti, the Myotis species represented by transcriptomic data. SI Appendix, Fig. S6, takes a focused look at the data for these five bats in the 100 manually inspected alignments. Strikingly, the bipartition of M. leucogaster as outgroup to Myotis has less than or equal the support of any other Myotis bat being outgroup to Myotis + M. leucogaster. This includes the hypothesis of M. ricketti as outgroup, which should have near-zero support under the data-type bias hypothesis. Meanwhile, the bipartition of M. leucogaster, M. ricketti, and Myotis davidii vs. the other two Myotis bats is the bipartition most clearly supported by the data. Furthermore, the relationships between the ranges of the bats in this clade roughly match our consensus phylogeny: M. ricketti lives in southeast Asia, M. davidii lives in central China, M. leucogaster lives in southeast Asia and central China, Myotis brandtii lives across Europe and parts of northern Asia, and Myotis lucifugus lives in North America (54\u201358). We recognize that this placement is surprising given previously published work, but our results suggest the placement of M. leucogaster may merit further consideration.",

We used the PAML software package (61) to identify dN/dS > 1 codons within each of the orthologous gene alignments that we created. We used codon models M8 and M8a, which estimate the evolutionary pressures that have acted at specific codon sites over the entire phylogeny of species included. These models do not consider unique evolutionary scenarios that have affected gene evolution along different branches over the phylogenetic tree like some other models. In M8, the data in each multiple sequence alignment is fit to a model where one group of codons from within the alignment is allowed to evolve with dN/dS > 1. M8a is the null version of this model, where that same category of codons is allowed but is constrained to dN/dS = 1. Because there is one additional degree of freedom in M8, the data will usually fit better to the M8 model (as estimated by a likelihood value). A gene was deemed to be evolving under positive selection when the data are a statistically better fit to M8 than to M8a (P < 0.05 after correction for multiple tests; Dataset S1). We performed this analysis on 10,650 genes that met criteria of having at least six species and 30 codons represented in the alignment. Out of these, 181 genes met the statistical criteria for being subject to positive natural selection, and these genes were hand-curated for function (Dataset S1). Table 2 shows a subset of the genes. Nineteen percent are known to be involved in immunity or the replication cycles of pathogens. Surprisingly, 8% are known to be involved in collagen formation, including 10 out of the 27 top scoring genes for positive selection (Dataset S1). We also looked at the gene ontology (GO) classifications which are overrepresented in the list of genes under positive selection and present this data in Dataset S2. The GO categories most enriched for positively selected genes are dominated by immune responses and collagen formation.",

            "text": "Understanding the evolutionary history of bats is important not just for the study of Chiropteran zoology but also for the study of bats as reservoirs of deadly human viruses. Knowledge of an accurate phylogeny improves analysis of positive selection in bat genomes because dN/dS analysis requires both gene alignments and a phylogenetic relationship of the orthologs being analyzed. Also, the reliable identification of gene orthologs will allow molecular biologists to functionally test differences in these genes from one species to the next (62). Functional studies such as these will allow us to understand whether some bats have unique features of their immunity that allow them to harbor viruses that are dangerous to humans (63). Herein, we have curated multiple sequence alignments of thousands of bat genes. Using both genomic and transcriptomic data, we were able to find 11,677 orthologous gene families. To enhance these alignments, we provided transcriptome data for two of these bats, H. monstrosus and R. aegyptiacus, from which we annotated 7,858 and 9,682 genes, respectively. We furthermore developed a general data cleaning method for filtering exons with nonrandom structural errors, in this case observed to result from genomic vs. transcriptomic data. For this method, we developed the MIXR software package which directly detects and removes alternate consensus run artifacts, and is available at http://github.com/hawkjo/mixr. The multiple sequence alignments that we have created for bat genes, both before and after exon filtering, are available for use by the wider bat and virology communities (http://numerical.recipes/chiroptera/). Using these alignments, we examined the history both of speciation and of positive selection in 18 species of bats. This study hopefully sets the stage for continued and more in-depth study of the evolution and functional differentiation of bat genes relevant to immunity and beyond.",

Due to the sheer scale of the data, we resolved each node in the tree with 100% reported posterior probability, although the topology differed slightly depending on the analysis method. Our results support the division of Chiroptera into the two suborders Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, in disagreement with the traditional division into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera. However, we acknowledge that rooting ancient clades continues to be a difficult phylogenetic problem, and further data may shed more light on this issue. We furthermore provide evidence for the placement of M. schreibersii, in which we agree with Hoofer and Bussche, supporting their proposal for the separation of Miniopteridae into its own family (53). We also provide evidence for the disruption of proposed subfamily Phyllostominae by D. rotundus. Most intriguingly, we saw M. leucogaster placed in the Myotis genus, which will require further investigation.",

Previously, work aimed at describing adaptive evolution in bats primarily focused on their unique traits, selecting families of genes to study for selection. These studies can broadly be divided into two categories, those that dealt with specific life traits, such as echolocation or metabolism related to frugivory (24, 64\u201373), and those that were related to pathogens or immunity (74\u201380). There are three studies that used larger datasets, two of which used whole-genome data (13, 23, 24). Unlike our study, Tsagkogeorga et al. (13) used genome-wide data to ask which genes might explain the alternative subordinal topologies supported by their data. Similarly, the Shen et al. (24) study was specifically interested in energy metabolism in bats due to their energy-expensive mode of locomotion, flight. Finally, Zhang et al. (23) used whole-genome data available from two distantly related bats, along with orthologs from a number of mammals, and inferred adaptive evolution in the innate immune pathway and DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Our work, in comparison, includes more Chiropteran species and a holistic analysis of selection in the bat genome. The addition of more species, and the generation of a high-confidence tree for these species, gives us better resolution for detecting adaptive evolution specifically within Chiroptera (81).",

Collagens are a family of structural proteins that form connective tissues in the body, including tendons, ligaments, and skin (89). The walls of veins, arteries, and capillaries also contain collagen (90). Collectively, the different forms of collagen constitute the most abundant protein in mammalian bodies (89). Bat wings consist of a network of collagen (91), and bats often have injuries on their wings which need to heal quickly (92). Recently, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungal pathogen that has killed more than 6 million bats, has been reported to damage collagen (93). It is less clear how pathogens would have placed pressure on collagen-formation pathways in the past, across many species. Alternatively, it seems possible that the demanding physical and physiological constraints inherent in muscle-powered flight put bats at an edge of what is evolutionarily achievable. In that case, one might expect to see, after speciation events, comparatively more positive selection in wing- and flight-related genes compared with genes involved in other adaptations, with collagen an indicator of the former set.",

For each analysis, we used the species tree generated in this study. Using PAML (61), each alignment was fit to the M8 and M8a codon models, both performed with the f61 codon model. Both the M8 and M8a models assume the dN/dS value for a given aligned codon is either a draw from a binned beta distribution (with fit parameters a and b) or a draw from a floating bin with parameter dN/dS = \u03c9. The parameter \u03c9 can float to values >1 in M8 and is set to \u03c9 = 1 for M8a. P values were calculated via \u03c72 test on twice the difference in reported log likelihoods of the two models, a likelihood-ratio test of nested models. GO category enrichment among positively selected genes was performed with the STRING database online software (101).",

(B) The alignment cleaning pipeline. First, each gene derived from genomic data was revisited to choose the isoform which best matches the consensus alignment sequence. Second, exons were filtered by structure, where exons with disagreement about boundary positions in the alignment and exons with >1% length difference between species were filtered out. Last, exons were filtered using the MIXR algorithm described in the text. (C) A total of 3,444 improved genomic isoform selections were performed, shown as a function of the improvement in percent matching the consensus sequence, i.e., (percent matching after) \u2013 (percent matching before). (D) Counts of unanimous second-consensus runs after each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline (with steps progressing from top to bottom in the graph). Unanimous second-consensus runs are defined as runs of more than three columns in a row where some minority of bat sequences agree with each other but disagree with those of all other bats. The final output contains only seven such runs with two or more species, and these are only up to three species and five amino acids long. (E) In each step of the alignment cleaning pipeline, weakly conserved sites are filtered at higher rates, enriching the final alignments for conserved sequences. \u201cStrong,\u201d \u201cWeak,\u201d and \u201cNone\u201d conservation categories are as defined by Clustal (47).
