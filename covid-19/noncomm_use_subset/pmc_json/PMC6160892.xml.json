Little is known about the protection conferred by the commonly used live attenuated vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A against IBV prevalent local strains in\nsouthern China. In the present study, significantly higher antibody levels and percentages of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes in vaccinated groups compared to the non-vaccinated\ngroups within 21 dpi indicated that the vaccines H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A could stimulate the immunized chickens to produce humoral and cellular immunity that potentially resist or eliminate the\ninfection of IBV.

Therefore, our data indicated that the vaccine 4/91 had a greater\nability to inhibit the replication and reduce the shedding of a homologous serotype virus than a heterologous serotype virus; the vaccine H120 provided poor protection against the heterologous\nserotype viruses. These findings support the necessity of developing new vaccines whose antigenicity match the antigenic profile of current prevalent IBV variants in the region.",

            "text": "According to the requirements in China, the clinical protection offered by a compliant IB vaccine must be not less than 80% against a virulent challenge [13]. Previous studies demonstrated that the H120 vaccine couldn\u2019t provide sufficient protection against the field isolates in China [6, 13,14,15, 24]. The latest report showed\nthat a novel recombinant virulent IBV strain was isolated from an H120- and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China [27]. In our study, the attenuated vaccine\n4/91 could not provide complete protection against IBV GX-NN09032 strain even though they shared the same serotype [20]. The reason for this may be that\na single vaccine dose of a monovalent vaccine could not provide sufficient immunity with complete protection to birds. Therefore, in an attempt to provide broader protection to chickens, the\nprime-boost vaccination program in combination with application of two different IBV vaccines (\u201clive + live\u201d or \u201clive + inactivated\u201d) should be performed for the birds in southern China. In\nother countries, it has also been showed that vaccination with two antigenically distinct live-attenuated vaccines can achieved a broad cross-protection against multiple different IBV types\n[5, 21, 22]. Further investigation will be necessary to determine which\ncombination of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines could provide the most effective protection against the prevalent local strains in southern China.",
