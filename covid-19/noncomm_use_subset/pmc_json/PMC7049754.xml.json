Fortunately, although researches in immunology are experimentally costly and very intensive, colossal amounts of data are usually generated. Such data can only be analyzed with high precision and speed using bioinformatics tools. For instance, genome sequencing as well as in vitro T-cell confirmation is done in few months as opposed to years using the conventional vaccine design.8 Also, computational immunological methods drastically reduce both time and labor needs in epitopes screening.5,9 With computational immunology techniques, it is possible to discover vaccine candidate epitopes simply by scanning the protein sequences in a pathogen of interest.5 Many of these proteins are yet to be isolated or at least cloned. Being pathogens specific and unique, they present ready candidates in vaccine construct.",

These pathogens do not depend on one route for their virulence of pathogenesis in human and thus to alter this process, increasing the specificity of the vaccine should be the aim and not just the effectiveness as seen in the current conventional vaccines.28,29",

Fortunately, with global research efforts, the genomes for several pathogens causing neglected tropical diseases and several emerging pathogens are becoming available.33 Computational vaccinology may now be applied to screen these genomes for possible vaccine target. With these tools, many proteins of virulence interest can be sequenced and the most essential gene of interest modeled for a potential vaccine candidate specific for that pathogen.

The human host\u2019s erythrocytes and hepatocytes usually display modified parasite proteins called Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) and Plasmodium falciparum hepatocyte membrane protein 1 (PfHMP1), respectively. These proteins function to assist the parasite to evade destruction by the host immune systems.95,96 The PfEMP1 proteins were identified as the prime ligands responsible for cytoadherence and resetting.97 They cause the infected RBCs of host tissues to sequester thus helping the parasite to circumvent clearance by the host\u2019s spleen.98 The membrane proteins also shield infected host cells from destruction by the spleen by adhering to the endothelium. Luckily, if the PfEMP1 protein is expressed for a long while; it comes under attack by the naturally acquired immunity.98,99 In defence to this, the parasite has expanded the var genes coding for PfEMP1 such that the genes can exist as a polymorphic family of as much as over 50 members in every genomic haploid. Antigenic switches work well here in that members of the polymorphic family (also called antigenic-variant-protein family) can be interchanged and cannot express their proteins at the same time. In this way, only one particular protein at the surface of the infected RBC is expressed at any given time.97,100",

Trypanosoma brucei replicates in the bloodstream (outside the cells) of their host, but at maturity, it crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier to cause several fatal complications. During replication in the bloodstream, the parasites are subjected to humoral as well as cellular immune responses. It evades the host defenses by encasing itself in homogeneous coat of glycoprotein called the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG).106,107 Though at initial invasion, the protein coat tends to protect the microbe from the immune system but on constant exposure, the coat will be identified as a foreign matter, and at this point the immune effectors can launch an attack against it. In a particular Trypanosoma brucei, there are diversities of the VSG protein being coded by more than a thousand genes in the parasite\u2019s genome. Unfortunately for the host, the expression of these genes is mutually exclusive. Expressed VSG gene is normally due to genetic re-assortments causing new alleles to be copied into the sites of expression. Some trypanosomes with these abnormal VSG genes evade humoral immunity and multiply thereby causing re-infection and chronic recurring infections.107",
