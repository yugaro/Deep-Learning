In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan, medical service utilization decreased due to fear of nosocomial transmission.12 However, in the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, which is highly infectious but has a low case-fatality rate, emergency care utilization increased.34",

The Korean government runs NHI as a single insurer, compulsorily covering inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services.1415 While NHI service ensures high accessibility to medical care, the gatekeeper function of primary clinics is weak, meaning that people can visit tertiary-care hospitals freely, with low out-of-pocket costs.

The effects of fear impacted everyone in the society regardless of age, sex, and SEP groups.7 The greater reduction in the epidemic areas than in other comparison areas also corroborates the explanation that the fear of MERS infection caused the reduced utilization of healthcare.",

Patients decide to use medical care based on their consideration of risks and benefits. During an infectious disease epidemic, patients use medical care when they feel that the benefits of healthcare utilization are greater than the risk of infection.1 When there were concerns about nosocomial infections, those with low-acuity diseases, which are considered to have little benefits from emergency service use, were less likely to visit the ER. In Korea, due to the absence of limitations on healthcare utilization and the weak gatekeeping role of healthcare delivery system, unnecessary hospital utilization of low-acuity patients is prevalent.2829 As a result, overcrowding in a tertiary-care hospital ER caused the MERS epidemic, and low-acuity patients decreased most when the risk of infection overwhelmed the benefit of emergency service use. A study of the SARS epidemic showed that restriction of non-urgent hospital utilization during the epidemic did not increase mortality and complication rates.30 The authors of that study concluded that restriction of non-urgent visits is a safe public health strategy to control nosocomial infections and to maintain hospital surge capacity. Examining the scale of ER visits for low-acuity diseases with little benefit from service use is important, not only for preparing appropriate emergency surge capacity but also for providing evidence to redesign emergency service to decrease healthcarerelated infectious disease outbreak.",

This implies that the number of patients with serious conditions visiting the ER did not change, even though overall emergency care utilization decreased. As shown for cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic stroke in this study, the reduction in ER use for high-acuity diseases is expected to be minimal in infectious disease outbreak. When fear of an epidemic spreads and ER visits decrease, preparations for serious conditions need to be focused, and patients with severe diseases should not face barriers to emergency care use.",

            "text": "This study had some limitations. First, our analysis was based on the assumption that no meaningful changes in factors affecting ER visits, except for the MERS epidemic, occurred during the study period, which might not have been completely true. For example, the ratio of ER visits in December 2015 was relatively low compared to the ratio in other comparison months (87.3%; Supplementary Table 1, only online). This may have been due to the influenza epidemic in December 2016, which occurred a month earlier than usual (influenza epidemic alarm was announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 2, 2014; January 22, 2015; January 14, 2016; and December 8, 2016). However, our analysis on the utilization by region (MERS risk area versus comparison area) corroborated our explanation. Second, the scope of this study only included patients who visited the ER. The health outcomes of those who did not use emergency services were not investigated. Although ER visits for the most severe conditions did not decrease, the reduction in emergency care utilization for MI and ischemic stroke, where acute care is important, might have led to complications other than short-term mortality.3132\nSupplementary Fig. 5 (only online) employing mortality data among the entire Korean population from Statistics Korea shows no apparent changes in overall mortality according to the MERS epidemic. However, further study is needed to investigate the long-term outcomes of reduced emergency care utilization. Third, ER visits due to traffic accidents, which account for a considerable proportion of injured patients, were not included in this study, as these cases were covered by auto insurance in Korea and not by the NHI. However, based on the estimates from NEDIS database in Korea, 5.1% of ER visits were covered by auto insurance.33 Changes in the ER visits covered by auto insurance would not critically change the findings.",
