            "text": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15-20% of all lung cancers [1]. SCLC differs from non-small-cell lung cancer in its rapid tumor doubling time, high growth fraction, early development of widespread metastasis, and better response to platinum doublets chemotherapy. Thus chemotherapy is a treatment mainstay, even in poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2, 3]. Bone marrow involvement or paraneoplastic syndrome is common in patients with SCLC [4]. Hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are reported to be occasionally accompanied by bone marrow metastasis or paraneoplastic phenomenon [5, 6]. However, complications such as fatal hemorrhage are rarely reported. The clinical presentation can make diagnosis or treatment difficult. Herein, we report an SCLC patient who presented with rapid-onset, refractory severe thrombocytopenia and development of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage.",

SCLC is the most aggressive histological subtype of lung cancer. However, favorable response is expected in 60% to 70% of patients with extensive-stage disease when systemic chemotherapy is given [3, 4]. Life-threatening manifestations rarely present in SCLC patients. When such manifestations do appear, as in the present case, the rapid-onset, unusual presentation may delay diagnosis or hesitation in deciding treatment, affecting survival adversely [7]. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment is a critical issue [8].",

However, hematologic abnormalities resulting from bone marrow metastasis and paraneoplastic phenomenon are not as common as those resulting from anti-cancer therapy [5, 6]. Severe thrombocytopenia developed rapidly and was refractory to platelet transfusion and dexamethasone administration. In addition, tests for anti-platelet antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative and anti-nuclear antibody was within normal range. These findings indicate that autoimmune disease was not likely to be the cause of thrombocytopenia [9]. Bone marrow examination is a diagnostic process for evaluating hematological abnormality or staging the disease. However, it rarely changes the stage [10] and bone marrow as an isolated metastatic site is found in fewer than 5% of SCLC patients [3]. Leukoerythroblastic reaction on peripheral blood smear is suggestive of bone marrow metastasis in the present case [11, 12]. Although bronchoscopy may be considered for localization or treatment in massive hemoptysis, it is contraindicated in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia [13].",
