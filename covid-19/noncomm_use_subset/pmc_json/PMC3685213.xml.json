Upon infection, H. pylori activates an inflammatory response which leads to the recruitment of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes to the gastric tissue (3). Macrophages can efficiently engulf H. pylori; however, this pathogenic bacterium has developed mechanisms to avoid killing upon phagocytosis and prevents the induction of an adaptive immune response (4\u20137). It is likely that the failure of macrophages to eliminate H. pylori contributes to bacterial persistence in the host and thereby to the development of chronic infection. Indeed, we have previously reported the requirement for macrophages in the development of H. pylori-induced gastritis in vivo (8).",

Several different mechanisms have been suggested based on the virulence factors expressed by H. pylori (9). H. pylori retards its own uptake by phagocytes, which has been suggested to be dependent on type IV secretion components encoded by the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (CagPAI) (10, 11), one of the main pathogenic factors in H. pylori infection (12). Once it is intracellular, H. pylori actively delays actin polymerization and phagosome formation in addition to disrupting membrane trafficking in macrophages (5).",

            "text": "It has been reported that probiotic supplementation to H. pylori eradication therapy increases tolerability and decreases side effects (14\u201316), but the results are contradictory (17). We have previously shown that the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a strong inducer of the Th1-polarizing cytokines interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) in dendritic cells (18\u201320). In this study, we investigated whether L. acidophilus is able to modulate the inflammatory response induced by H. pylori in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in uptake and processing of the bacteria in addition to the immune response generated. BMDMs were stimulated with either L. acidophilus or H. pylori or with both bacteria in combination. Contrary to our expectations, our results demonstrate that H. pylori is able to block the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-12 by L. acidophilus. Furthermore, Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, key regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, respectively, required for the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed when H. pylori was added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus. This inhibition was independent of the viability of H. pylori or the virulence factor CagPAI but completely dependent on the VacA toxin. Confocal microscopy revealed that the addition of H. pylori to L. acidophilus-treated BMDMs induces alterations in the endocytic pathway that prevent intracellular processing of L. acidophilus and thereby the induction of IFN-\u03b2. Thus, H. pylori is able to prevent the activation of innate cytokines that can modulate the adaptive immune response in macrophages via the virulence factor VacA, which possibly allows persistence and limited eradication in the host.",

Since we wanted to ensure that L. acidophilus is able to interact with the macrophages prior to their encounter with the motile pathogen H. pylori, we added H. pylori 251 to BMDMs after 1 h of prestimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM (cell-bacterium ratio, 1:1).

Furthermore, in epithelial cells, VacA utilizes the Rac1 GTPase to induce cell vacuolation in host cells (32). We therefore speculated that the H. pylori VacA toxin may also play a role in macrophages and may be implicated in the inhibition of Ifn-\u03b2 (Fig. 3C). Our hypothesis was confirmed, since an isogenic H. pylori 251 vacA mutant, in contrast to the wild-type strain, was unable to block Ifn-\u03b2 when added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (P < 0.01). To recapitulate that VacA is essential for the immunosuppression of L. acidophilus-induced IFN-\u03b2, we added bacterial-free supernatants (SN) from wild-type H. pylori 251 in various dilutions to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). Our finding was confirmed, since the VacA-containing supernatant from wild-type H. pylori 251 strongly inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 response induced by L. acidophilus.

To determine the intracellular location of H. pylori and L. acidophilus, we applied deconvolution microscopy and analyzed the uptake of the bacteria with the early endosome marker EEA1 (34) and the late endosome and lysosome marker LAMP-1 (35). Since we have shown that H. pylori is able to block the induction of Ifn-\u03b2 at a very early stage (Fig. 2B), we added L. acidophilus NCFM to BMDMs and analyzed the localization of the bacterium after 2 h. As can be observed in Fig. 4A, a large proportion of intracellular L. acidophilus bacteria did not colocalize with either EEA1 or LAMP-1 compartments. Indeed, we determined that after 2 h of incubation, approximately only 7% and 30% of intracellular L. acidophilus NCFM were contained within endosomal and lysosomal compartments, respectively (Fig. 4C). The remainder of bacteria were not associated with either marker (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01). In contrast, we detected the formation of megasomes and a significant increase in L. acidophilus colocalized in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments (19% and 50%, respectively, after 2 h incubation) when H. pylori was added, compared to results for BMDMs that were stimulated with L. acidophilus alone (Fig. 4B and C). Figure 4D presents a magnified image of L. acidophilus localized in lysosomes (white arrow) in either the presence or absence of H. pylori. Our results indicate a greater release of L. acidophilus from the phagocytic compartments in the absence of H. pylori. We suggest that the addition of H. pylori leads to an accumulation of L. acidophilus in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, thereby preventing the induction of IFN-\u03b2 by L. acidophilus.",

Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that while L. acidophilus induces T-cell recruiting chemokines (Cxcl10 and Cxcl11), proinflammatory (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), and Th1-skewing cytokines (IFN-\u03b2 and IL-12), H. pylori predominantly induced cytokines indicative of innate immune responses (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1) and neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl3). Most importantly, microarray analysis revealed that when H. pylori is added to BMDMs prestimulated with L. acidophilus, Th1-skewing cytokines induced by L. acidophilus are strongly inhibited. Real-time PCR confirmed that H. pylori blocks the gene expression of IFN-\u03b2, IL-12, Cxcl10, and TNF-\u03b1, while it has an additive effect on the cytokine IL-1\u03b2. Thus, our results show that H. pylori prevents the production of factors induced by L. acidophilus in macrophages that contribute to initiating the adaptive immune response.",

In contrast, the genes Rgs1/2, Fgd2, and Dock8, regulators of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases, which are molecular switches controlling the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, were strongly suppressed. It is well established that many bacterial pathogens regulate host trafficking pathways by the selective inclusion or retention of GTPases in host cells during infection and use these important cellular regulators as part of their overall virulence strategy (36, 37). Thus, our data suggest that H. pylori modifies GTPases in macrophages to promote bacterial persistence in the host.",

Both inhibitors completely abrogated the expression of IFN-\u03b2 in BMDMs stimulated with L. acidophilus, indicating that both phagocytic uptake and phagolysosomal maturation is a prerequisite for IFN-\u03b2 signaling in response to this bacterium. Our microscopy data showed that H. pylori changes the endosomal transport of L. acidophilus from the endosomal and lysosomal compartments in BMDMs, suggesting that a specific endocytotic pathway is a key step for the induction of IFN-\u03b2.",

LAMP-1 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (concentration, 100 ng/1 \u00d7 105 cells; Rohan Teasdale, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland) was transfected into half of the wells containing BMDMs using the jetPEI macrophage in vitro DNA transfection kit (Polyplus Transfection SA, France), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The next day, medium was removed, and 200 \u00b5l of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (without antibiotics and FCS) was added. L. acidophilus NCFM was labeled red with the dye Dil (Vybrant cell-labeling solutions; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA), and H. pylori 251 was labeled green with the dye DiO (Vybrant cell-labeling solutions) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The bacteria (or medium) were added (100 \u00b5l/well) to the BMDMs at an MOI of 1:1 (total volume, 400 \u00b5l).
