Antigenicity studies in the avian infectious bronchitis virus indicated that the N protein is one of the immunodominant antigens that induce cross-reactive antibodies in high titers, whereas the S glycoprotein induces serotype-specific and cross-reactive antibodies (10). It has also been reported that the N protein from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus is the major immunogen of the virus. Several domains of antigenic importance in the N protein were identified by monoclonal antibodies raised against PRRS virus 11., 12., 13.. Interestingly, deletion of the 11 amino acids from the C-terminus of the N protein (NC) disrupted the epitope configuration recognized by all of the conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (13); amino acid substitution within the C-terminal domain revealed that the secondary structure of the domain is an important determinant of conformational epitope formation (14).",

In this study, the coding region of the C-terminal portion of the N protein was cloned as GST-Hisx6 (Glutathione S-transferase Histidine) fusion and the peptide was expressed in yeast. The purified fusion protein showed positive signals when probed with sera from SARS patients in Western analysis. Using the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) approach, the purified fusion protein was shown to specifically recognize the sera from SARS patients, but not those from the negative controls.",

Genetically engineered peptides would be one of the best ways to identify the genomic segment associated with the antigenicity and to develop vaccines defended against SARS. Of various methods to overproduce proteins of interest, the yeast system was chosen to express the fusion protein based mainly on two major considerations. First, the cloning procedure is simplified by taking advantage of the homologous recombination cloning strategy in yeast because it is a restriction and ligation reaction-free system, which remarkably simplifies cloning procedures. Secondly, most posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, could be reserved in the eukaryotic expression system (16). These properties may play an important role in immunoreaction. Our data provided firm evidence that the antigenicity of the N protein was well preserved in the NC fusion protein.",

This model was established for other coronaviruses and recently confirmed by Northern analysis of the SARS-CoV-containing Vero-6 cells using a 3\u2032 terminal probe (7). If the co-terminal model is correct, the N gene in all other 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic transcripts would be translated into huge amount of the N protein in addition to the N-specific transcripts, unless a possible mechanism stop or inhibit the ribosome binding site of the gene from translation with the subgenomic transcripts.",

There are only two possible reasons why the N protein is freely exposed to the host immune system. First, the virus collapses after injecting its genome into the host cells. Second, the extra N protein, after binding to the genomic RNA in a fixed molecular ratio, would not be packaged by the cellular liquid bilayer membrane and therefore remains in the cytoplasm. When the host cells collapse, the N protein is released. The most possible mechanism is that the N protein is engulfed by the antigen presenting cells (APC) and presented to T cells for the adaptive immunity. Whether the N protein is involved in the process of the innate immunity remains to be revealed.",

Both Western and ELISA analyses demonstrated that the N protein fragment render highly specific immuno-response in the SARS patients. The ultimate goal of our study is to provide new tools for the campaign against SARS. The cloning and expression of the antigenic fragment of the virus is more advantageous and safer than the method using the whole virus lysate in large-scale production of the antigen and vaccine. The immunoreaction of the NC fusion protein with SARS sera indicates that the NC fusion protein may be of great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tool for the rapid and on-site identification of SARS patients, and further more, may become a candidate for the vaccine against SARS.",
