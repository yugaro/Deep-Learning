The mission of NBIC is to enable early warning and shared situational awareness of acute biological events and support better decisions by federal agency partners and the agencies of state, local, and tribal governments. It does this through the rapid identification, characterization, localization, and tracking of biological events worldwide (whether they occur in the human, animal, plant, or environmental realms) that may have an impact on the U.S. homeland.",

NBIC also produced informational reports that informed the decision making of senior leadership among DHS, the White House, as well as state and local partners. In addition to collating and analyzing information from diverse federal and academic partners, NBIC also produced an analytical discussion paper regarding the possible spread of H7N9 in China based on what was known about the epidemiological, geographical, and ecological parameters of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1.",
