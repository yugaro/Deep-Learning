In recent years, thyroid cancer has been well concerned because of the rapid rise in its incidence.1 As a first-line drug applied for T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus), metformin contributes to stabilize blood glucose levels through inhibiting gluconeogenesis and reducing hepatic glycogenolysis.2 Interestingly, the application of metformin sharply decreases the incidences of tumor diseases, suppresses the growth of malignant cells and enhances chemotherapy-sensitivity.3 Therefore, metformin may exert a potential anti-tumor role. It is expected to be an adjuvant drug for the treatment of thyroid cancer.",
