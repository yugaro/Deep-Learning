Previous studies have suggested that IL\u20108 in the NLF recruits and activates neutrophils, contributing to the inflammation that coincides with nasal symptoms observed in rhinitis patients.19 CXCL10 and CXCL9 may play roles in the development of nasal allergic inflammation and are elevated in NLF in allergic rhinitis patients.20 Additionally, the level of CCL5, which is involved in leucocyte recruitment in the allergic nasal mucosa, is also elevated in allergic rhinitis patients.21 These observations suggest that Biyeom\u2010go regulates intranasal inflammatory and allergic reactions and reduces chemokine levels. In summary, Biyeom\u2010go might improve nasal symptoms by suppressing leucocytes of the nasal mucosa that are involved in rhinitis\u2010associated inflammatory and allergic reactions, resulting in improvements in the intranasal condition.",
