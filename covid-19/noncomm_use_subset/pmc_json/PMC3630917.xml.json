Indeed, spike protein-based vaccines are safer and more effective than vaccines based on inactivated or live-attenuated viruses.8 However, new concerns have been raised over the use of full-length viral spike proteins for developing subunit vaccines because some of the non-neutralizing, or immunodominant, epitopes in the spike proteins may induce antibodies that enhance, rather than neutralize, viral infection, or otherwise cause harmful inflammatory responses in vaccinated hosts.9,10 Therefore, selection of the key functional domains that contain neutralizing and/or T-cell epitopes as the immunogens appears to be an important strategy in developing antiviral vaccines.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the vaccines based on the RBD in the spike protein of SARS-CoV (Figure 2A) induced the most potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in vaccinated animals,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 suggesting that the RBDs in the spike proteins of other viruses that cause emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as influenza virus (Figure 2B), HeV and NiV (Figure 2C), may also serve as targets for developing vaccines to prevent corresponding infectious diseases.18",

Indeed, we found that a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the sera of SARS patients and animals immunized with the inactivated SARS-CoV strongly reacted with the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein since depletion of the RBD-specific antibodies resulted in elimination of the neutralizing activity.12,37 Chen et al.38 also demonstrated that recombinant RBD could absorb and remove most neutralizing antibodies from the antisera of mice, rabbits and monkeys immunized with a live-attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara virus expressing the full-length S protein. We have constructed several subunit SARS vaccine candidates using recombinant RBD expressed in Escherichia coli, insect and mammalian cells and used them to immunize mice. We found that all of them could induce highly potent and broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses11,17 and protective immunity against challenge with live SARS-CoV. We also demonstrated that intramuscular and mucosal immunization of animals with the adeno-associated virus-based RBD vaccine could elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge.15,16,17 These findings suggest that this RBD-based vaccine has considerable potential for development into a safe and effective SARS vaccine to prevent future SARS epidemics.",

Each of the single-chain monomers is initially synthesized as a precursor polypeptide, HA0, which is then cleaved by host proteases into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. The HA1 subunit is mainly responsible for receptor binding. It mediates viral attachment to the cellular receptors of the target cells known as sialic acid of glycoproteins and glycolipids.45 Different HAs of IAVs recognize different sialic acid receptors. For example, the HAs from humans bind preferentially to sialic acids in the \u03b1 (2,6) linkage, while those from avians and equines recognize \u03b1 (2,3) linkages. It appears that the HAs from swine may recognize both \u03b1 (2,3) and \u03b1 (2,6) linkages.46 After viral attachment to the target cells, the HA2 subunit located at the membrane-proximal helix-rich stem region mediates virus entry into the target cell by fusion of the viral envelope and the cellular membrane via the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA2.45 The HA2 N-terminal fusion peptide contains the highly conserved sequence among all IAVs, and neutralizing epitopes targeting this region have been identified.47",

A report by Prabakaran and colleagues indicated that a recombinant baculovirus-expressed trivalent vaccine covering the major neutralizing epitopes in the RBD of H5N1 effectively neutralized viruses from clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4, 7 and 8 of H5N1 and protected 100% of the mice against challenge with three different clades (clade 1.0, clade 2.1 and clade 7.0) of H5N1 strains. Our recent studies also revealed that a recombinant HA1-Fdc vaccine containing RBD neutralizing region induced high titers of antibodies that cross-neutralized clades 0, 1, 2.2 and 2.3.4 of H5N1 strains and completely protected vaccinated mice against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1 and 2.3.4.64",

Symptoms of HeV and NiV infection of humans can be respiratory, including hemorrhage and edema of the lungs, or encephalitic, resulting in meningitis. The principal natural reservoirs for HeV and NiV are pteropid fruit bats; however, recent evidence of henipavirus infection has been found in a wider range of species, including flying foxes, humans, cats, horses, rabbits and laboratory rodents6 (Figure 4).

            "text": "Similar to the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, the IAV HA protein RBD spans about 215 aa (aa 105\u2013319) with three conserved structural elements45 and contains primary neutralizing antibody epitopes that serve as important targets for influenza vaccine development.48 A number of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing mAbs, such as NR2728 (146), S139/1,54 B-1 and D-1,61 were identified to specifically bind to the conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes in the interface overlapping with, or adjacent to, the RBD in HA1. Our recent studies have shown that vaccination of mice with the fusion protein HA1-Fdc, which consists of H5N1 HA1, a trimeric motif foldon and a human immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, resulted in induction of potent neutralizing antibody responses and complete cross-clade protection against H5N1 infection,64 including elucidation of neutralizing mAbs whose epitopes were mapped to RBD (unpublished data). All these findings support the feasibility of developing RBD-based influenza vaccines. It is anticipated that these RBD-based influenza vaccines could be effective against divergent IAV strains, including those that may cause future influenza pandemics or epidemics.",

For example, entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into the hepatocyte requires at least four cellular cofactors, including CD81,76 the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin,77 and scavenger receptor BI.78 It is expected that the sites in the E1 and E2 proteins of HCV for binding to the above cofactors or putative HCV coreceptors may serve as targets for development of preventive vaccines against HCV in the near future.",

SARS-CoV begins its life cycle when its S protein binds to the cellular receptor ACE2. After receptor binding, the conformation change in the S protein facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway. Then SARS-CoV releases RNA into the host cell. Genome RNA is translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. At the same time, polymerase, which produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs by discontinuous transcription, is finally translated into relevant viral proteins. Viral proteins and genome RNA are subsequently assembled into virions in the ER and Golgi, which are budding into the lumen of the ERGIC and then transported via vesicles and released out of the cell.
