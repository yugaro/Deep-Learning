In China, the first patient infected with MERS\u2010CoV from South Korea was diagnosed in May 2015,5 and it will be extremely important to prevent, control, and treat MERS\u2010CoV infections during any future outbreaks. Hence, effective small animal models are needed to investigate viral pathogenesis and evaluate MERS\u2010CoV therapeutics and vaccines.",

Previous studies showed that transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 (hDPP4) receptor could be infected intranasally with MERS\u2010CoV and developed acute pneumonia.13, 14, 15 Therefore, hDPP4 transgenic mice were selected for exposure to MERS\u2010CoV\u2010containing aerosols using an animal nose\u2010only exposure device.",

According to the WHO, it has been suggested that human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, to a very limited extent, is caused by inhalation of droplets or airborne virus and close contact with patients.20 The above studies have demonstrated that MERS\u2010CoV has a risk of aerosol transmission. In addition, aerosol inhalation is the main clinical route of infection for viral respiratory illnesses. There are different clinical presentations in animal models established by different infection routes. Comparative studies using approaches with different perspectives will contribute to a deeper understanding of MERS.",

Higher virus RNA levels in the instillation group might contribute to the more severe histopathological changes observed.

The induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs plays an important role in tissue immunopathological changes and fatal pneumonia. An elevated pulmonary viral load and its injurious effects on the pulmonary system are likely responsible for the increased inflammatory response. It is possible that the relatively robust pulmonary inflammatory response in mice may have promoted MERS\u2010CoV replication, causing increased pulmonary viral loads in the mice.36\n",
