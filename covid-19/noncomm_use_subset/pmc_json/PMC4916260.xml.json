We assumed the process starts with identification of a need for all stakeholders to coordinate and cooperate on cross-sectoral health issues. Of the three modes of economic coordination \u2013 hierarchies, markets, and networks (25) \u2013 the latter was taken as most appropriate for bringing together OH stakeholders. Development of OH stakeholder or actor\u2013networks to facilitate cross-sectoral collaboration may require significant system change across sectors with already existing hierarchies. Actor\u2013network theory (ANT) and Social network analysis (SNA) provide a theoretical and analytical framework for understanding and guiding successful policy or innovation in complex systems that require network building (26).",

The key and central component focuses on stakeholders and their existing (and missing) relationships, which would be required to initiate and institutionalise OH. The SNA widely used to study social networks of stakeholders was therefore the key analytical method of the central component. In OH adoption, stakeholders would not only initiate multisectoral cooperation on cross-sectoral health issues but also organise and hold in place activities of the other four components (mobilisation, social acceptance, alliance building, and institutionalisation). In doing so, they are guided by policy and legal frameworks. In the absence of appropriate policies, the stakeholders can also influence policy and legal frameworks. Mobilisation, a dynamic interplay between evidence and arguments (26), would shape and define how OH actions and solutions are framed. Stakeholders\u2019 current perceptions and the provided evidence would influence the actions and solutions. OH policy works if key stakeholders gather cross-sectoral allies (and their resources) to join a network based on empirical evidence and benefits associated with change. However, the evidence is a cultural construct. Although there are scientific principles across nations, there might be a strong cultural influence on what is acceptable as evidence. Often, stakeholders may focus on a common problem that requires OH approach. Social acceptance process requires buy-in by governments and other actors. Institutionalisation refers to the process by which authoritative acceptance and institutional support emerges with appropriate governance structures (e.g. professional associations and issue-specific government units or committees) and financing and development of appropriate policy frameworks.",

            "text": "Based on SNA (27), we characterised relationships between the stakeholders. Three relationships were considered: financial resources flows, cooperation (joint planning and implementation), and information sharing. Strengths of the three relationships were measured by asking respondents to assign individual qualitative scores using grouped ordinal and interval approaches. They were asked to describe frequency (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) and intensity (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) of the relationships and based on both, they scored each as either non-existent, weak, medium, strong, or very strong. Often, as noted in (29), respondents experienced difficulties scoring each relation independently and were allowed to collapse the three and use one score instead. To construct some true interval-level measure, we converted the qualitative scores into quantitative values using a scale of 0\u20138 as in no linkage (0), weak (1 or 2), medium (3 or 4), strong (5 or 6), and very strong (7 or 8). The decision to assign a lower or higher score for, let us say, medium was based on described frequency and intensity of interactions. The approach to an extent balanced the predispositions of the researcher and the respondent's descriptions, whereas the continuous measure of the relationships allowed estimation of statistical measures. The quantitative scores were plotted in a matrix. UCINET software (30) generated SNA sociograms and statistical measures (density, clustering coefficients, degree of closeness, and between-ness) of relationship strength. The statistical measures were estimated to understand the extent of relationships, and stakeholder power and influence within the OH network. Centrality statistics of actor degree, closeness (or farness), and between-ness reflect power and influence within the network. Degree measures describe the way an actor is embedded in a network while closeness refers to how close they are to others. High in-degree values for a stakeholder reflect a position where others want to influence it, for example, through information sharing. High out-degree measure for a stakeholder reflects a position of where it wants to influence those linked to them. Between-ness refers to a position of an actor in a network as in between several pairs of actors, or no other actors lie between them and other actors. The degree of clustering (cluster coefficient) of stakeholders in a network is estimated as an average of all the neighbourhoods.",

Respondents consistently pointed to inadequate capacities of the DVOs, DMOs and pastoralists to effectively play their respective roles. Main barriers to effective roles mentioned by the stakeholders included inadequate government funding, personnel and other logistics, unfavourable animal health policies, weak interface between pastoralists and service providers, pastoralists\u2019 knowledge capacity, increased vulnerability to shocks, and low incentives for livestock keepers to report animal diseases. They attributed the low incentives to difficulties in accessing the veterinary services.

The local office of World Health Organization (WHO) analysed the public health information to share with local public health heads. Joint public and animal health activities were rare. The HSG coordinated only public health issues, though DVOs were invited to the meetings. The community-based public health facility committees brought together community leaders, community health workers (CHWs), and health officers for the purposes of enhancing community participation in health management and disease reporting. The public health platforms provided opportunities for private sector to engage and support public health services.

The network called for the formation of national rabies groups. Twelve scientists/technical officers drawn from DVS, MOH, and other animal and human health institutions started an informal platform and named it the Kenya Rabies Group (KRG) in 1993. The group's activities included collection and sharing of rabies information used to advocate for both joint control efforts and increased resource allocation. The efforts led to a 440% rise in allocation of rabies control funds in 1997/98 and increased private sector participation in the control. However, the activities were not sustained and ceased in 2000, attributed to failures in alliance building and social acceptance by the heads of the institutions involved. Other factors cited included re-deployment of founding members and imbalanced composition as animal health experts accounted for 83% of KRG members. As a result, funding for rabies dropped by 92% in 2001 despite a focal person based at DVS maintaining a link to SEARG.",

The stakeholders and their networks would require undertaking activities towards mobilisation, alliance building, social acceptance, and institutionalisation of OH. The study applied SNA methods namely snowballing, sociograms and statistical measurements of relationships to generate information on the OH stakeholders in Kenya, their cross-sectoral relationships and the extent to which they had institutionalised OH. To focus the analysis, a specific cross-sectoral health problem, RVF, was identified. The SNA snowball method facilitated mapping of 32 and 21 public and private RVF and OH stakeholders at national and subnational levels, respectively, drawn from animal and public health sectors and climate prediction agencies. Each stakeholder played a unique role and therefore we considered all as critical for cross-sectoral collaboration. Identification of climate prediction agencies at national level and a cross-sectoral steering group (DSG) of the ALRMP at subnational show that cross-sectoral collaborations for zoonotic diseases may go beyond the two health sectors.",

The centrality measures findings show that cross-sectoral mandate and coordination is critical in networks. At both levels, high ties (in and out) of the MOH and DVS can be attributed to their legal mandate to implement prevention and control of diseases, which made other stakeholders want to exert their influence on them. On the other hand, high ties of CDC, WHO, and FAO reflect their global mandates in OH and their networks. These five organisations (CDC, WHO, FAO, MOH, and DVS) can be said to enjoy an advantage of having alternative ways to access resources and are able to call on more resources if needed, evidenced by them rallying others around ZTWG and ZDU.
