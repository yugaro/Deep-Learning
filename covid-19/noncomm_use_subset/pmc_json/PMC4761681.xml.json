In contrast, the EcoHealth concept is defined as an ecosystem approach to health, tending to focus on environmental and socioeconomic issues and initially designed by disease ecologists working in the field of biodiversity conservation. This concept results from the hybridization of different approaches and thematic fields: conservation medicine, disease ecology, and the framework developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (1). This vision led to the notion of ecosystemic services linked to health and welfare, integrating social and citizen dimensions. From a socio-political perspective, EcoHealth and One Health refer to two different regimes of health governance. Public health policy studies converge in considering two regimes in health governance: \u2018international health\u2019 and \u2018global health\u2019 (2, 3). EcoHealth is related to the international health regime, as One Health is linked to global health. The field of One Health is evolving on a large scale and at official levels, whereas EcoHealth operates at a more grass-root, pragmatic level. The One Health approach is driven by international standards institutions (OIE, FAO, WHO) and is supported and recognized by the donor community. The EcoHealth paradigm, however, takes a broader view of health and links public health to natural resource management within an ecosystem approach to human health. EcoHealth is seen by several scientists as a One Health approach which optimizes interdisciplinarity including strong participatory and citizenship components.",

Both are motivated by the conviction that health concerns must be addressed at the human\u2013animal interface within their broader natural and social environments (i.e. socio-ecosystem approach). Both try to integrate scientific disciplines combining multi- and cross-disciplinary approaches. Both aim to mitigate the risks threatening ecosystems and public health, including veterinary public health. Both deal with the complexity of diseases and health (4). Finally, both struggle to properly define the boundaries of their paradigms despite their apparent similarities regarding principles and objectives. There are concerns about the risk of instrumentalisation of the socio-ecological aspects (conservation, ecosystemic approaches) by the medical sector. Thus, the health sector could use the \u2018politically correct\u2019 discourse of One Health but without in effect changing its practices of leadership and funding opportunities regarding environment and ecosystem approaches to health.",

For academics, both paradigms can be applied to inter- and trans-disciplinary frameworks for research activities on zoonotic diseases or health matters and/or are viewed as research topics (e.g. efficacy and efficiency of One Health). Zinsstag (5), who distinctly applies One Health and EcoHealth according to a given health issue or disease, suggests they should converge in the areas of zoonoses, disease emergence, and pandemic threats. Barrett and Bouley (6) examined the potential benefits from collaboration between One Health and EcoHealth. For Ngyuen-Viet et al. (7), EcoHealth is progressively converging with the One Health paradigm and suggests combining the two paradigms. For health professionals, policy- and decision-makers, both paradigms, but especially One Health, have underpinned official cooperation among sectors for food safety and public health improvement, mostly in developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. But a better connection between the two spheres is needed. Leung et al. (8) emphasise the decisive function of governance and partnerships for the development of holistic tactics: \u2018Further research on governance and partnership models, as well as systems-based organizational working practices, is needed to close the gap between One Health and EcoHealth theory and public health practice\u2019. However, until now, despite these calls from the scientific community, both concepts have failed to converge from an institutional viewpoint. The ideology behind both concepts being globally similar, hidden interests or sectorial deadlocks must be preventing closer integration. Cross-sectorial and interdisciplinary scientific collaboration on analysis, modelling, and risk management will allow joint development of decision support tools to help implement integrated health strategies and policies.",

These components are critical drivers of health operating at different scales, and their integration into all-inclusive studies could facilitate the unification of the two paradigms. Human and social sciences and modelling approaches are increasingly associated with the field studies carried out in these three sites in order to improve health of vulnerable populations exposed to diseases and to manage animal and public health.

Such diseases do not fit \u2018traditional One Health topics\u2019 linked to previous experience of emerging zoonotic diseases within global health governance schemes (which One Health paradigm is actually rooted in). Such topics call for global governance schemes such as One Health and for holistic and integrated approach to health. It allows emphasising local context importance (both from an environmental and socio-economic perspective), participation, and multi-level governance. We suggest conducting investigations on proposals that need to be addressed at diverse scales using a blend of biological and social disciplines at the junction between the environmental, social, medical, and animal science sectors.
