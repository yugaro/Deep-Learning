Besides classical respiratory viruses (RV), i.e. influenza viruses (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and 229E [5-9], other \u201cnew\u201d RV have currently been added to this list, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [10], SARS-CoV [11], HCoV NL63 and HKU1 [12,13], human bocavirus (hBoV) [14] and others. Most RV cause benign and self-limited infections in immunocompetent adults. However, clinical impact of ARI increases when they affect children, elderly, immunocompromised individuals and/or subjects with chronic underlying diseases, in whom RV constitute an important cause of hospitalisations, mainly during the cold months of the year [15,16]. They involve important costs for health systems and constitute a frequent cause of school and work absenteeism. In certain circumstances, emerging RV cause a great impact in health systems worldwide, as occurred with SARS-CoV and Flu pandemics, the last one taking place in 2009.",

In clinical practice, serology is not useful for the diagnosis of viral infections, such as ARI, that cause frequent recurrences and are mainly restricted to the respiratory mucosa. Thus, in these cases, direct detection of the virus in the site of infection has to be a priority [16,17].",

NAAT have recently contributed to increase the sensitivity of viral culture. PCR assays can be carried out on the cell culture supernatant to detect the isolates. This approach has demonstrated the highest sensitive reading procedure, and has allowed identifying viral isolates in cell monolayers with no cytopathic effect [22].

Molecular assays have greater sensitivity than conventional methods as viral culture or antigen detection and indeed, they are able to detect new viral agents. Another advantage of NAAT compared with viral culture is that they do not require viable viruses. Thus, they have converted in the gold standard for detection of RV. Thus, most advances in clinical diagnostic virology have been made on NAAT.",

Indeed, multiplex PCR extends the portfolio of virological diagnostic methods. Although advantages are strong enough to compensate for any disadvantage, multiplex PCR have intrinsic inconveniences: as the number of targets increase, the possibility of losing sensitivity and specificity increases as well, due to competition among primers and viral targets that consequently yields unspecific PCR products. Indeed, multiplex PCR has to be optimized to ensure the adequate amplification of each viral genome. Multiplex PCR assays have demonstrated that co-detections of RV in a sample are a common event [29]. Whether these co-detections express true infections by all viruses and/or prolonged shedding of certain agents is difficult to demonstrate, although some authors have pointed out the role of co-detections of RV in the severity of the disease [30].
