            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting is programed in some messenger RNAs such that a ribosome can slip on a messenger RNA (mRNA) and start translating a new sequence of amino acids (1\u20134). Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is utilized in many RNA viral systems, including HIV-1, to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA (5,6). The Escherichia coli (E. coli) dnaX gene is a well-known -1PRF model system with high efficiencies in the range of \u223c50 to \u223c80% (7,8). Two DNA polymerase subunits (\u03c4, \u03b3) are programed in the 0 and -1 reading frames (7). Many biochemical studies showed that such efficient -1PRF is promoted by three mRNA signals in the dnaX gene; a hexanucleotide slippery sequence (A AAA AAG) coding two lysine codons, a stimulatory hairpin structure, and a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (8\u201310). The distances between the signals are crucial for the frameshifting efficiency. For the most efficient frameshifting, the signals are positioned in a way that the slippery sequence is placed on the ribosomal peptidyl (P)- and aminoacyl (A)- sites while the downstream hairpin is at the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel. At the same time, the upstream SD sequence base pairs with 16S ribosomal RNA near the ribosomal exit (E) site.",

            "text": "Slow translational elongation rates in the presence of -1PRF signals are well known and widely accepted as an effect of the downstream hairpin structure (1\u20133), as the ribosome needs to unwind the hairpin structure to translocate (3,11). A translational elongation cycle includes a peptidyl transfer reaction upon delivery of a selected aminoacyl-tRNA by elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) as a ternary complex (TC) (EF-Tu(GTP)-aminoacyl-tRNA) (12). In the next step, deacylated- and peptidyl-tRNAs translocate from the ribosomal P- and A- sites to the E- and P-sites and the ribosomal complex advances by three nucleotides toward the 3\u0384-end of the mRNA. Translocation is accomplished via multistep large-scale conformational changes catalyzed by elongation factor-G (EF-G) (13\u201316). Spontaneous ribosomal conformational changes include rotation of the ribosomal subunits (50S, 30S) relative to each other, L1 stalk closure and formation of hybrid tRNAs (15\u201320). In the hybrid state, the anticodon stem loops of the two tRNAs are located at the P- and A-sites in the 30S small subunit while their acceptor arms are located at the E-and P-sites in the 50S large subunit (P/E, A/P). Further structural studies showed that translocation of the codon:anticodon base-pairs through the 30S subunit involves many more intermediates along with EF-G binding and GTP hydrolysis (21\u201328). EF-G-bound intermediates include swiveling of the head of the 30S subunit and chimeric hybrid tRNAs (pe/E, ap/P or ap/ap), where the two tRNAs are in transit toward translocation direction keeping partial contacts with both P- and E-, and A- and P-sites in each subunits. (21,25\u201328). Along with the swiveling of the 30S head domain and chimeric hybrid tRNAs, the mRNA is also pulled by 2\u20133 nucleotides toward the translocation direction (27). Complete translocation is achieved with back rotation of the 30S head domain to the un-swivelled position along with dissociation of EF-G, forming a POST complex, where the two subunits are in a non-rotated state and the tRNAs are in E/E and P/P states (21\u201323). A recent smFRET study suggested that a rapid reversible head domain movement is involved in the final stage of the translocation as a rate-determining step (29).",

Multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events on the ribosomal hybrid state were implied before a successful translocation in the context of -1PRF signals (30,31). Both studies suggested that frameshifting takes place during the translocation process of the second codon of the slippery sequence. Another single molecule study on the -1PRF of the dnaX gene by Chen et al., where they simultaneously probed ribosomal inter-subunit rotation and the events of EF-G or tRNA accommodations, showed that a downstream hairpin structure can induce a non-canonical rotated state during or after translocation of the first codon of the slippery sequence to the P-site (32). Multiple EF-G bindings were observed and proposed to be wasted for back-rotation of the ribosomal complex to relieve the non-canonical state. Frameshifting was proposed to take place during the back-rotation attempts by EF-G binding; accommodation of the next amino acyl-tRNA on the second codon of the slippery sequence takes place on the already frameshifted frame. The proposed timing of the frameshifting by Chen et al. is after accommodation of the first codon, but before accommodation of the second codon of the slippery sequence.",

In the mRNA construct, the SD sequence plays a role as an initiating signal as well as -1PRF signal. The first five codons encode an amino acid sequence of MVKKF, where the tandem lysines are coded in the slippery sequence. Frameshifting by -1 on the slippery sequence results in translating different amino acid sequence (MVKKV\u223c) and termination at -1 stop codon. In order to examine the effect of each signal on the frameshifting efficiency and the ribosomal dynamics, we constructed mutated mRNAs by deleting the hairpin (\u0394hp), mutating the SD sequence (mSD: AGGGAG \u2192AUAUCA) and mutating the slippery sequence (mSS: A AAA AAG \u2192 G AAG AAG). As both AAA and AAG are read by tRNALys, the mSS still encodes for two consecutive lysines, but is not slippery any more. Mass spectrometry analysis of the in vitro translated products from each mRNA construct showed that FS efficiency drops to 50% by mutating SD, 20% by deleting hairpin, and to 2% by mutating the slippery sequence to be non-slippery (Supplementary Figure S1). These changes are consistent with reported bulk biochemical studies (7,10). The results confirm again that the slippery sequence is essential to the frameshifting and that the hairpin is a critical promoting signal. Also, our data show that the SD sequence clearly plays an important role on frameshifting, although it is not as critical as the hairpin.",

The Tl1 event was followed by another FRET excursions with much less intense Cy5 signals (denoted as EF-G2 by the blue arrows in Figure 2B, bottom trace) resulting in \u223c0.3 FRET values (Figure 2D). In contrast to the EF-G1 binding that mostly occurred only once for the Tl1 event, multiple EF-G2 binding events were observed before Cy3 signal disappeared.

Considerably decreased reaction times were observed between Tl1 and Tl2 (31 \u00b1 3 versus 20 \u00b1 1 s, Figure 3B), while slight changes were observed in the reaction time for Tl1 to first EF-G2 (4.7 \u00b1 0.2 versus 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 s) and the EF-G2 dwell times (0.44 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 s) (Supplementary Figure S5). The results suggest that the duration between the Tl1 and Tl2 mostly corresponds to the reaction time for the second round of translocation (Tl2), by which the first and second codon of the slippery sequence, base-pairing with (Cy3)tRNALys and peptidyl-tRNALys, translocate from the P- and A-sites to the E- and P-sites, respectively. Release of the (Cy3)tRNALys from the E-site afterward would result in abolishing the fluorescence signal.

During the low Cy3 intensity periods, multiple Cy5 signal excursions were repeatedly observed with \u223c0.3 FRET efficiency (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3). Considering that there was no such fluctuations in the Cy3 intensity for the reactions with EF-G only in the absence of TC(K) (POST-K1*, Figure 2A, upper trace), the fluctuations of the Cy3 intensity likely correspond to a spontaneous conformational change of the ribosomal complex (PRE-K1*K2) at an early stage of translocation process such as formation of the hybrid state (16,18\u201320), by which the Cy3 labeled acceptor end of the deacylated (Cy3)tRNALys at the P-site in the 50S large subunit experiences another environmental changes. Further study is required to confirm the assignment.",

The long reaction time for the Tl2 is composed of fluctuations of Cy3 fluorescence intensity and multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events during the low Cy3 intensity periods (Figures 2B and 4A). The average dwell time of the bound EF-G2 for the second slippery codon translocation (EF-G2 dwell) was almost the same as that of the EF-G1 for the first slippery codon translocation (EF-G1 dwell) (Figure 5B).

In accordance with such a big change of the frameshifting efficiency, there were several significant changes of the ribosomal dynamics upon deleting the hairpin. First of all, the translocation of the \u0394hp mRNA took place at significantly faster rates for the both first and second slippery Lys codons as compared to those of the dnaX mRNA (RT to Tl1: 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 versus 2.8 \u00b1 0.1 s, Tl1 to Tl2: 8.5 \u00b1 0.4 versus 25 \u00b1 2 s, Figure 4B). In consideration of almost no change on the first EF-G2 binding time after Tl1 event (Tl1 to first EF-G2: 4.6 \u00b1 0.3 versus 4.9 \u00b1 0.2 s, Figure 4B), the difference on the second translocation times becomes more severe. Second, the complete translocation took place with mostly a single EF-G binding event for both rounds of translocation (Figure 5A). Finally, the dwell times of the bound EF-G were more than twice as short (e.g. EF-G2: 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s, Figure 5B). All the results strongly suggest that the hairpin itself indeed hinders the translocation and causes consumptions of multiple number of EF-Gs, in agreement with a previous smFRET study using a FRET pair between the L1 stalk and P-site tRNA (30).",

Also a successful translocation of the second Lys codon (Tl2) took place via fluctuations of the Cy3 intensity and multiple EF-G bindings as observed in the dnaX frameshifting mRNA (Figure 4A). However, faster Tl2 was observed on the mSS mRNA (17 \u00b1 3 versus 25 \u00b1 2 s, Figure 4B). Interestingly, the average dwell times of the bound EF-G were prolonged more than twice on both codons compared to those of the dnaX (EF-G1 dwells: 0.82 \u00b1 0.05 versus 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 s and EF-G2 dwells: 0.88 \u00b1 0.03 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s, Figure 5B). Also a smaller number of EF-G2 bindings were observed for the Tl2 (Figure 5A, bottom). These observations suggest that SS helps dissociation of the bound EF-G to reset the ribosomal complex for another translocation attempt by allowing the ribosomal complex to explore other base-pair interactions. Adopting alternative base-paring might provide more flexibility to the ribosomal complexes in relieving the tension caused by the upstream SD and the downstream secondary structure.",

It is a distinct difference from the Tl2 process on the dnaX and mSS constructs, which showed multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events until the successful translocation. The dnaX and mSS constructs contain both the upstream SD sequence and the downstream hairpin, while the mSD and \u0394hp lacks either the hairpin or the SD sequence (Figure 1). However, other than the single EF-G2 bindings for the Tl2, there was no similarity between the results on the mSD and \u0394hp. Translocation rates on the mSD were as slow as those on the dnaX (Figure 4B). But, EF-G2 dwell time of the mSD was more than twice as long as that of the dnaX (0.86 \u00b1 0.05 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s), while EF-G1 dwell times are almost the same (0.30 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 s) (Figure 5B). The results imply that SD sequences promote dissociation of the bound, futile EF-G, especially during the second Lys codon translocation process. These observations suggest that the SD sequence actually aids resetting the ribosomal complex from a non-canonical conformation formed upon encountering a downstream secondary structure. Other noteworthy changes upon mutating the SD are a slower peptidyl transfer rate (Tl1 to first EF-G2: 10.8 \u00b1 1.0 versus 4.9 \u00b1 0.2 s, Figure 4) and a lower success rate of the complete translocation (Supplementary Table S1).

Furthermore, the dnaX-programmed PRE ribosomal complexes experienced multiple conformational fluctuations between the hybrid and classical states with possible multiple EF-G binding-dissociation events prior to translocation. In contrast, \u0394hp-programmed PRE complexes sampled the hybrid state approximately once with one EF-G binding event before undergoing translocation. Here, we directly visualized EF-G binding and dissociation events along with two rounds of translocation events using a FRET pair of (Cy3)tRNALys and (Cy5)EF-G. The results in this study show that the dnaX-programmed PRE complexes translocate the second Lys codon of the slippery sequence via multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events and \u0394hp-programmed PRE complexes translocate fast with a single EF-G binding.

Especially, a bulk FRET study between the ribosome and EF-G by Caliskan et al. suggested that frameshifting promoting secondary structure in the mRNA hinders translocation step of the two slippage codons by impairing the back-rotation of the 30S head domain and dissociation of EF-G (31). Their observation of the prolonged EF-G dwells by bulk study can be explained by our results showing multiple EF-G binding events for the slow translocation of the second Lys codon, since greater number of EF-G binding events results in longer dwells on average. In another single molecule fluorescence study, Chen et al. employed a zero-mode waveguide to directly observe binding events of (Cy5)EF-G or (Cy3)/(Cy5)tRNA while monitoring the inter-subunit rotation with a FRET pair of (Cy3B)30S and (BHQ)50S ribosomal subunits (32). They also observed that multiple EF-G bindings were required during or after translocation of the first Lys codon to resolve a long lived inter-subunit rotated state. Thus, the proposed timing of the frameshifting in their study is prior to the peptidyl transfer to the second Lys codon of the slippery sequence, unlike our results. The different results might be due to different experimental conditions including different labeling schemes. Further study will be required for more systematic comparisions between the experimental conditions that regulating the ribosomal dynamics and thus the frameshifting pathways.",

Our results indicate that the slippery sequence not only provides alternative base-pairing options, which is a prerequisite for the frameshifting, but also helps the ribosomal complexes under strain to be relaxed faster. Among the large-scale conformational changes involved in the translocation process, back-rotation of the 30S head was proposed as the rate-determining step and takes place along with EF-G dissociation (22\u201324,28,29). EF-G-bound intermediate hybrid states were observed with swiveling of the head of the 30S subunit, on which tRNAs are in chimeric hybrid state (pe/E, ap/P or ap/ap) and mRNA codon:anticodon are pulled by 2\u20133 nucleotides in the translocation direction (21,25\u201328). The faster dissociation of futile EF-G in the presence of the slippery sequence suggests that codon:anticodon base pair interactions are partially disrupted on an EF-G trapped intermediate hybrid state and need to be reformed before EF-G dissociation. A slippery sequence can help fast reformation of the codon:anticodon base pairings by providing alternative base pair options. Recently Yan et al. in our research group showed that a ribosome can be very flexible in adopting frameshifting steps such that not only -1, but also -2 and even +2 slips occur in the presence of the same stimulatory structure (41). Thermodynamic stability of the codon-anticodon base-pairing interactions was suggested as the major determinants in the final frameshifting steps. Their results also imply that codon:anticodon base-pairings are easily reformed for more stable interactions.",

            "text": "Translocation of the PRE programmed with mutated SD (mSD) took place slowly as in the dnaX\u2013PRE complexes, indicating that a hairpin itself can be a strong road block without the SD sequence. However, multiple EF-G binding events were not observed for the mSD-PRE complexes during the long period of translocation process. Interestingly, multiple EF-G bindings were only observed for the PRE-ribosomal complexes with mRNAs containing both a SD and a hairpin (dnaX, mSS). Multiple shorter EF-G binding events in the presence of SD shows that the SD sequence works with the hairpin to promote EF-G dissociation. Unresolved SD-rRNA base pairings may push the ribosomal complexes backward such as back-swiveling of the 30S head domain along with the mRNA, during which trapped futile EF-G dissociation is also facilitated. Once reset, the ribosomal complexes are now open for another translocation attempt. A single-molecule force study by our research group inferred that a trapped ribosome on the slippery sequence between the upstream SD-sequence and the downstream hairpin may be able to move back and forth by one or two nucleotides (41). These observations also support our proposal, as such ribosomal movement can correspond to the reversible swiveling of the 30S head domain accompanying 2\u20133 nucleotide movements of mRNA (27) The low success rate on translocation of the mSD may also mean that the resetting of the ribosomal complex with EF-G dissociation is a more active way to promote translocation on the slippery sequence surrounded by the SD and hairpin. Without the active conformational resetting processes, the ribosomal complex might be stalled in an inactive form such as a non-canonical rotated state (32,42). Therefore, SD sequence actively stimulate frameshifting by promoting such dynamic ribosomal conformational changes. Our proposal explains why there were no correlations between frameshifting efficiency and the pausing extent (43,44) or the thermodynamic or mechanical stabilities of the downstream secondary structures (5,45), but the conformational plasticity of the structure was related to the frameshifting efficiency (5,45).",

The complex was immobilized on the surface via hybridization at the 5\u0384-end with a surface-immobilized DNA strand. A pre-translocation complex (PRE-VK1*), which contains tRNAVal in the P-site and peptidyl-(Cy3)tRNALys in the A-site, was formed on the surface by delivering a ternary complex of EF-Tu(GTP)-Lys(Cy3)tRNALys in the absence of EF-G.

(B) Representative time traces of fluorescence signals of the dnaX-ribosomal complexes upon real-time (RT, black arrow) delivery of 100 nM (Cy5)EF-G to the PRE-VK1*. The PRE-VK1* complexes were identified by Cy3 signals at the beginning of imaging. Delivery of (Cy5)EF-G triggered excursions of high FRET states (red arrow), indicating accommodation of (Cy5)EF-G near the (Cy3)tRNALys. Later on, Cy5 signals disappeared, while Cy3 intensity slightly increased. The observation is consistent with the published results that a slight increase of the Cy3 signal on the tRNA was assigned to the translocation of the tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (34). Slight increase of the Cy5 background signal is due to the floating (Cy5)EF-G.
