However, there was only one mutant that dramatically enhanced the presentation of exogenously loaded peptides to peptide-specific CTLs compared to the wild-type (WT) HLA-A*02:01 molecule.5 This HLA-A*02:01 mutant contains an amino acid substitution from histidine to leucine at position 74 (H74L) that is located in the \u03b11 helix in the peptide-binding groove. We expected that the H74L mutant might be useful for the efficient induction of HLA-A*02:01-restricted, peptide-specific CTLs, leading to the development of a novel CTL-based vaccine. However, there was no appropriate method of verifying this hypothesis at that time.",

It should be noted that SCTs could efficiently stimulate peptide-specific CTLs in vivo following DNA vaccination,6 and the SCT-based vaccination could provide protection against tumors9,10 and pathogens.11,12 These pre-assembled molecules bypass the normal antigen processing pathway, and hence, SCTs should be resistant to virus-encoded immune evasion proteins that prevent peptide processing, loading, and presentation.13 In addition, SCTs may not be greatly affected by aberrations of the antigen processing and presenting machinery that are frequently observed in tumors.14 Thus, this approach is expected to have applications as DNA vaccines against tumors and viral infection.",

To examine in vivo CTL responses, the HLA-A*02:01-transgenic mice, designated as HHD mice,15 were employed. HHD mice express the transgenic HHD molecule, in which human \u03b22m is covalently linked to a chimeric heavy chain composed of HLA-A*02:01 (\u03b11 and \u03b12 domains) and H-2Db (\u03b13, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains).15 Because the innate H-2Db and mouse \u03b22m genes have been disrupted by homologous recombination, HHD molecules are efficiently utilized for the HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL responses in HHD mice. Therefore, HHD mice have been used as a versatile preclinical animal model for the study of HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL responses.16,17 For in vivo priming experiments, we generated recombinant adenovirus expressing SCT composed of an influenza virus-derived peptide and either WT HHD or HHD with the H74L mutation. HHD mice were then immunized with these adenoviruses, and the efficiency of peptide-specific CTL induction was compared by various assays. Here, we clearly demonstrate for the first time that a simple point mutation in the MHC class I heavy chain of the SCT molecule induces enhancement of both in vivo CTL priming and antitumor protection.",

The HHD-H74L gene was then transfected and expressed in mouse lymphoma, RMA cells (RMA-H74L). The expression level of the H74L mutant molecules on RMA-H74L cells was almost equivalent to that of the HHD molecules on RMA cells expressing the WT HHD (RMA-HHD). To test the ability of the H74L mutant, HLA-A*02:01-restricted, peptide-specific CTL lines were generated from HHD mice, and examined for their killing activities against RMA-HHD and RMA-H74L in the presence of synthetic peptides at various concentrations in standard 51Cr-release assays. Consistent with the previous data,5 RMA-H74L cells were lysed by influenza A matrix peptide (FMP58-66)-specific CTLs at much lower peptide concentrations than RMA-HHD cells (Figure 1c). Similar results were obtained with different HLA-A*02:01-restricted peptides derived from human papillomavirus (HPV)-E6 (HPV-E629-38), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-tax (HTLV-tax11-19) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-pol (HIV-pol476-484) (Figure 1c), indicating that this phenomenon was not peptide-specific as described in the previous studies.18",

A series of amino acid substitutions at position 74 of the HHD molecule were also tested for their effects on the peptide presentation to FMP58-66-specific CTLs. In addition to H74L, three other mutations involving H74A, H74F, and H74T apparently enhanced the peptide presentation in the FMP58-66-specific CTL response (Figure 1e). In contrast, several mutations including H74E, H74K, H74N, and H74Y impaired the FMP58-66-specific CTL recognition.

To prove this hypothesis, we produced SCT constructs consisting of the following elements beginning with the amino terminus: the leader sequence of \u03b22m, the FMP58\u201366 peptide, the first flexible linker of 15 residues, the mature portion of human \u03b22m, the second flexible linker of 15 residues, and, finally, the heavy chain of the HHD (SCT-HHD) or HHD-H74L (SCT-H74L) molecule (Figure 2a,b). When the SCT-HHD or SCT-H74L construct was stably expressed in the TAP-2-deficient cell line, RMA-S, there was an apparent increase of the expression level of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface at 37\u00b0C in comparison with RMA-S-HHD in the absence of an exogenous peptide (Figure 1c). These results implied that SCT-HHD or SCT-H74L was expressed on the cell surface even in the absence of endogenous peptides, suggesting that the SCT molecules are likely to bypass MHC class I antigen processing due to their preassembled forms.",

After 2 weeks following immunization, spleen cells were prepared, stimulated in vitro with FMP58\u201366, and then examined for their FMP58\u201366-specific killing activities by the 51Cr-release assay (Figure 3).

At an inoculation dose of 1.6 \u00d7 107 TCID50, however, percentages of CTL-positive mice were diminished to 60 and 80% in mice vaccinated with Ad-FMP and Ad-SCT-HHD, respectively (Figure 3a). In contrast, all of the mice generated FMP-specific CTLs after immunization with 1.6 \u00d7 107 TCID50 of Ad-SCT-H74L (Figure 3a). Furthermore, even at lower doses such as 1.6 \u00d7 106 and 1.6 \u00d7 105 TCID50, Ad-SCT-H74L primed FMP-specific CTLs in 60\u201380% of the immunized mice, whereas FMP-specific CTL responses were not detected in any of the mice injected with either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD at the lower doses (Figure 3a,b). Ad-WT at any doses tested did not elicit FMP-specific CTLs in mice (Figure 3). These data indicate that Ad-SCT-H74L primes FMP-specific CTLs in mice more efficiently than Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-FMP.",

Twelve hours later, % lysis specific for RMA-HHD-FMP cells in each spleen was measured by flow cytometry. At a virus inoculation dose of 1.6 \u00d7 107 TCID50, there was no statistical difference in % specific lysis between Ad-SCT-H74L-infected mice and either Ad-SCT-HHD- or Ad-FMP-injected mice (Figure 6a). However, a significant difference between them was observed at an inoculation dose of 1.6 \u00d7 106 TCID50. That is, vaccination with Ad-SCT-H74L gave significantly higher clearance of RMA-HHD-FMP tumor cells expressing endogenous FMP58-66 in mice than that with Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-FMP (Figure 6a,b). We next determined whether Ad-SCT-H74L vaccination could mediate prophylactic protection against a lethal challenge of RMA-HHD-FMP tumor cells. After immunization with 1.6 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of either Ad-WT, Ad-FMP, Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L, mice were challenged intravenously (i.v.) with 5 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse of RMA-HHD-FMP cells. As shown in Figure 6c, all Ad-WT-infected mice died by day 29, whereas many of Ad-SCT-H74L-immunized mice (7 out of 10 mice) survived for over 60 days after tumor inoculation. On the other hand, vaccination with 1.6 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD did not induce sufficient protection against i.v. challenge with a high dose of tumor cells (Figure 6c). We also tested whether vaccination with Ad-SCT-H74L could inhibit the growth of tumor at the skin. To this end, HHD mice were immunized with various recombinant adenoviruses at a dose of 1.6 \u00d7 106 TCID50, and then inoculated subcutaneously with a low number (5 \u00d7 104/mouse) of RMA-HHD-FMP tumor cells. Vaccination with Ad-SCT-H74L inhibited tumor growth more efficiently than that with Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD, while immunization with Ad-WT had no effect on the reduction of tumor growth (Figure 6d). Overall, these data demonstrate that vaccination with Ad-SCT-H74L provides better protection from tumor challenge than that with Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD.",

At the same time, there were a number of class I mutants that had no practical impact on peptide-specific CTL responses. On the other hand, a few mutants involving H74L have been reported to obviously enhance CTL recognition. Another example is the mutant HLA-A*0201 containing a mutation from glutamine to glutamic acid at position 115 (Q115E).24,25 The Q115E mutation resulted in the enhancement of CD8 binding that improved antigen recognition at the cell surface and CTL priming in vitro.24",

All HLA-A2 subtypes encode a histidine except HLA-A*02:11 which uses an aspartic acid. In addition, for all HLA-B molecules which have been sequenced, position 74 is an aspartic acid or a tyrosine (Y). Two different groups found that CTL recognition presented by H74D was slightly impaired.21,23 The same group showed that H74Y did not display an increase in CTL recognition.23 Interestingly, the H74D mutation had little effect on the CTL response but the H74Y mutation impaired CTL recognition in this study (Figure 1e). In addition to H74L, three more mutants, H74A, H74F and H74T enhanced FMP-specific CTL responses in the presence of an exogenous FMP58\u201366 peptide (Figure 1e). It is unclear at present why these four particular amino acid substitutions caused the enhancement of CTL recognition, but we could speculate that these mutations may provide more depth in the C pocket which is usually shallow in comparison with other pockets, leading to the increased affinity of peptide binding (Figure 1d). In contrast to the exogenous peptide, we previously showed that the endogenously processed peptide was not presented to CTL by HLA-A*02:01 with the H74L mutation.5,18 In accordance with these data, FMP-specific CTLs could not recognize either RMA-H74L, -H74A, -H74F or -H74T cells infected with influenza A virus (unpublished observations). These data suggest that the histidine at position 74 might plays a critical role related to the formation of the ER peptide-loading complex in the antigen processing. This idea might be able to explain why the human immune system has not evolved to incorporate these mutations at position 74.",

Taking advantage of this attribute, we examined whether the H74L mutant had the potential as a vaccine platform for the immunotherapy. As shown in Figures 3\u20135, Ad-SCT-H74L stimulated FMP-specific CTLs in HHD mice at lower viral doses than Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-FMP. These data strongly suggest that SCT-H74L molecules are more stable at the cell surface than SCT-HHD or native HHD molecules, and thereby, FMP-specific CTLs can be generated even by fewer MHC class I/peptide complexes per cell on the cell surface in mice vaccinated with Ad-SCT-H74L. As an SCT molecule retains a covalently attached peptide, the original SCTs are supposed to be steadier on the cell surface than are the equivalent native class I molecules, making them potentially more immunogenic.6 In the original SCTs, however, the linker extending from the C-terminus of the peptide would disrupt the F pocket anchoring of the peptide in the peptide-binding groove.27,28 A peptide with the high binding affinity may be little affected by this disruption. However, when a peptide with the low or medium binding affinity is incorporated in the SCTs, their assembly may be much less efficient. This might explain our current data showing that Ad-SCT-HHD was not drastically superior to Ad-FMP at the in vivo CTL priming and the antitumor protection (Figures 3\u20136). Since the H74L substitution enhances the peptide binding to HLA-A*02:01 (Figure 1d), this mutation would diminish the negative influence of the linker on the peptide anchoring.",

            "text": "To eliminate the detrimental effect of the peptide linker, Hansen et al. attempted to improve the design of the SCTs by engineering the MHC class I heavy chain. They focused on the tyrosine at position 84 (Y84) of the heavy chain because the conserved residue, Y84 creates a part of F pocket and plays a major role to accommodate the C-terminus of the peptide in the peptide-binding groove.27 Firstly, a mutation from tyrosine to alanine at position 84 of a heavy chain (Y84A) was introduced into the SCT comprises H-2Kb heavy chain, \u03b22m, and an ovalbumin peptide (SCT-Y84A).27 It was speculated that Y84A would partially open the binding groove to allow a better fit of the C-terminal linker-attached peptide. Indeed, ovalbumin-specific CTLs killed target cells expressing SCT-Y84A somewhat better than those expressing the original SCT or native H-2Kb without the Y84A mutation.27 Unlike H74L (Figure 1d),5,18 however, noncovalently attached native H-2Kb mutant with the Y84A mutation exhibited very poor peptide binding in comparison with WT native H-2Kb,27 indicating the enhancement mechanism of SCT-Y84L in the CTL recognition is different from that of SCT-H74L. Notably, it is still unclear whether SCT-Y84A can efficiently elicit ovalbumin-specific CTLs in vivo. Secondary, the tyrosine at position 84 of the MHC class I heavy chain and the second residue of the first linker were changed to cysteine to form a new disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues, covalently trapping the peptide in the binding groove.28,29 The SCTs with the disulfide traps were particularly useful for relatively weak binding peptides. It was shown that DNA vaccines with disulfide traps enhanced the immune response to a low affinity peptide in vivo.30 However, there is no published information concerning the functional comparison between the SCT-Y84A and disulfide trap. In addition, the Q115E mutation described above24,25 was also introduced into SCT of H-2Kb (SCT-Q115E).30 However, they presented only a data of ELISPOT analysis to show the predominance of SCT-Q115E over its WT counterpart at in vivo priming peptide-specific CTLs in mice.30 Anyhow, the introduction of the Y84A mutation, the disulfide trap and/or the Q115E mutation into SCT-H74L might generate a synergistic effect on the in vivo priming of peptide-specific CTLs. This approach should also be beneficial for improving the instability of MHC class I multimers composed of lower affinity MHC/peptide complexes and enable them to make more comprehensive analyses of CTL responses to pathogens and tumors.",

These data reveal the high efficiency of Ad-SCT-H74L for the induction of protective antitumor immunity, suggesting that SCT-H74L has the great potential to improve the current tumor vaccine strategy. In addition, the SCTs have a valuable advantage to bypass antigen processing,7,8 and therefore, the SCT-H74L may overcome several immune evasion strategies of tumors that block the antigen processing pathway. It was shown that the enhanced peptide loading by the H74L molecules was not peptide-specific (Figure 1c,d).18 However, it is necessary to confirm that other HLA-A*02:01-restricted peptides in the SCT-H74L format would behave in the same manner as FMP58\u201366 does. This is of particular importance in designing SCT-H74L as tumor vaccines because many tumor-derived peptides usually have low binding affinity to MHC class I molecules. The capacity of SCT-H74L to bind and present low affinity epitopes remains to be investigated. However, we have preliminary data showing that the H74L mutation enhanced binding and CTL recognition of tumor peptides including WT1, Her2/neu and MAGE-3 in comparison to the WT counterpart, using RMA-S-H74L and RMA-H74L. Hence, it is possible to assume that the SCT-H74L may improve to bind and present low affinity epitopes including tumor epitopes and self peptides. Another major concern is whether any H74L-like mutations can be found in other HLA class I alleles. On the bais of this data, the conformational change of the shallow C pocket might be of key importance.",

After addition of restriction site sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, HHD cDNA was subcloned into the NheI-HindIII sites of the pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expression vector (pcDNA3.1-HHD). pcDNA3.1-HHD was then used as a template to construct a library of mutant HHD genes ligated with pcDNA3.1. The inverse PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis35 was performed using KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacture\u2019s instructions. In brief, this method requires two back-to-back primers oriented in the reverse direction to amplify the entire plasmid. One of the primers contained a nucleotide change that caused a single amino acid substitution at position 74 in the \u03b11 domain of HHD. After the reaction, the template plasmid DNA was digested by DpnI that recognizes the Gm6ATC (m6-methylated) sites of plasmid DNA purified from ordinary host E. coli. The indigested PCR product containing a nucleotide substitution was then recircularized by T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligase, and the resulting plasmid was transformed. We generated 15 different kinds of pcDNA3.1-mutant HHD plasmids with point mutations at position 74 from histidine to alanine (H74A), cysteine (H74C), aspartic acid (H74D), glutamic acid (H74E), phenylalanine (H74F), glycine (H74G), isoleucine (H74I), lysine (H74K), leucine (H74L), asparagine (H74N), glutamine (H74Q), serine (H74S), threonine (H74T), valine (H74V), and tyrosine (H74Y). The whole nucleotide sequence of each mutant HHD gene was confirmed by the DNA sequencing services (Operon Biotechnologies).",
