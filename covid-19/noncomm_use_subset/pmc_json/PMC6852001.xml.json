These IDTE have caused substantial human suffering, placed considerable pressure on government resources, and inflicted significant economic damage. In financial terms, the cost of potential pandemics can amount to US$60 billion per year (Sands, Mundaca\u2010Shah, & Dzau, 2016; Sands, Turabi, Saynisch, & Dzau, 2016).

A review of IHR core capacities during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic documented an inadequate response to the emergency (World Health Organisation, 2011), an assessment of the 2014 Ebola outbreak highlighted slow reaction and poor communication (World Health Organisation, 2016), while the 2016 Zika virus outbreak highlighted the need for efficient surveillance. Although these post hoc assessments of failures in public health responses to IDTE can help to identify deficiencies in IHR core capacities and IHR non\u2010compliance, additional factors might be responsible for the emergence of IDTE (Gostin et al., 2015, 2017). It is possible that IHR core capacities are necessary but not sufficient to prevent the spread, control or response to such threats. They might not comprehensively identify and mitigate all the underlying drivers and determinants of IDTE in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world (Glaesser, Kester, Paulose, Alizadeh, & Valentin, 2017; Jones et al., 2008; Morens et al., 2008; Paules & Fauci, 2017; Semenza, Lindgren, et al., 2016; Semenza, Rocklov, Penttinen, & Lindgren, 2016; Weiss & McMichael, 2004). For example, measles has recently resurfaced in Europe as a result of global resurgence, increasing mobility and low vaccine uptake, in part related to vaccine hesitancy (Leong, 2018; Massad, 2018). In 2017, the chikungunya virus was introduced into France and Italy by viraemic passengers and spread by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, in part due to favourable climatic conditions (Lillepold, Rocklov, Liu\u2010Helmersson, Sewe, & Semenza, 2019; Rezza, 2018; Rockl\u00f6v et al., 2019; Semenza & Suk, 2018).",

Despite this global public health effort, no quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of IHR core capacity implementation on cross\u2010border IDTE has been conducted to date. We designed a panel study to investigate the association between improvements in national IHR core capacities with changes in cross\u2010border IDTE, using epidemic intelligence data collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and, specifically, whether IHR core capacities accurately reflect the ability of countries to prevent the spread of IDTE. We assessed country\u2010level IHR core capacity implementation against the occurrence of cross\u2010border IDTE from 2010 to 2016 using a longitudinal modelling framework controlling for population size.",

The assessment is based on an analysis, using IHR and Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) criteria and expert opinion (Table S1). ECDC initiated data collection for epidemic intelligence in June 2005. We analysed cross\u2010border IDTE that originated in one of the 28 EU Member States (EU28) from 2010 to 2016. This time period included the migrant wave of 2015 (Semenza, Carrillo\u2010Santisteve, et al., 2016). We included IDTE with a risk of introduction to or propagation between Member States within the EU/EEA and IDTE that may require timely and coordinated EU action to contain (Table S1). We also analysed cross\u2010border IDTE for other parts of the world that were recorded by ECDC epidemic intelligence, despite the low numbers of IDTE identified in those countries. We excluded travel\u2010associated Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreaks not originating in the EU28 from the analysis due to changes in reporting during the study period.",

The main purpose of the framework is to enable countries to measure their current status and assess progress over time. Although individual IHR core capacities do not necessarily carry the same weight in an assessment of capabilities, all attributes are given the same weight in the framework. The scores range from 0% to 100% and were available from 2010 to 2016 (World Health Organisation). The analysis also included potential hazard 1 (zoonotic events) and potential hazard 2 (food safety); however, potential hazard 3 (chemical events) and potential hazard 4 (radiation emergencies) were not included in this analysis as they do not relate directly to IDTE.",

We modelled the relative change in the incidence of cross\u2010border IDTE that originated in one country of the EU28, with a panel study, using a longitudinal general estimation equation framework (GEE) (Hanley, Negassa, Edwardes, & Forrester, 2003) with a Poisson log\u2010link using random effects by country of origin to adjust for unmeasured confounders. We used an exchangeable correlation structure of the observations within countries, not to make prior assumptions of the temporal covariance structure. Initially, we performed univariate analysis of the association of each of the IHR core capacities to cross\u2010border IDTE. The annual population estimates for countries were included in the model as an offset variable, providing a denominator for the capita rate of IDTE. We used R 3.4 (Anonymous, 2014) and SAS 9.4 (the PROC GENMOD procedure) statistical softwares for data management and analysis. We present estimates of incidence rate of cross\u2010border IDTE for a 10% increase in each IHR core capacity (scale: 0%\u2013100%). For the combined contribution of different IHR core capacities, it was not possible to perform a multivariate regression, due to high internal correlations. Instead, we conducted analysis of a composite indicator of the mean core capacity and additionally ran a principal component analysis for the 11 capacities (Table 1). The principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the dimensionality of the IHR core capacities by making linear combinations and can be used instead of studying individual capacities, for example, in situations of collinearity. The component scores were normalized in order to be comparable to the original core component scales (0%\u2013100%) in the univariate analysis. We performed the same Poisson regression analysis using the PCA scores as predictor variables of the risk for cross\u2010border IDTE, to study the combined effect of core capacities.",

The IRR estimate from the first PCA score was also very similar to the estimate from the average composite measure of the IHR core capacities (decrease 20% vs. 19%), and further indicated that the IRR from the univariate analysis of IHR core capacities cannot be combined, due to the strong inter\u2010core capacity correlations.",

            "text": "The use of country\u2010level IHR core capacities can result in ecological fallacies. Heterogeneity in the data or historic events could have biased our results. For example, improved infectious disease prevention in general during the study period (improvements in vaccination coverage, food safety, water supply, etc.) could have confounded our results. While GDP (as a broad proxy for general prevention) was highly correlated with IHR core capacities, GDP was not associated with IDTE incidence rates in our analysis. Moreover, we have no indication of improvements in general prevention over the study period; to the contrary, vaccination coverage for example, has declined in certain countries (e.g. Italy). It is important to bear in mind that this longitudinal study has a much stronger plausibility of an inference of a causal association than a simple cross\u2010sectional study. We relate a change in IHR core capacities to a change in IDTE over time. Thus, due to this temporal association, the causal inference is high, but nevertheless potentially subject to biases. Another potential bias is reporting bias due to the self\u2010assessment of IHR core capacities (Gostin et al., 2017) which could have shifted our results to the null. Selective reporting could also have contributed to the high inter\u2010core capacity correlations, which decreases the granularity of our results. To overcome this lack of objective metrics, WHO has introduced a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) as part of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (Bell et al., 2017; World Health Organisation, 2019a). This is a voluntary, multi\u2010sectoral, peer\u2010to\u2010peer process with external experts to assess country capacity to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to public health risks. Such an assessment is likely to be more objective than a self\u2010assessment of IHR core capacities. As of April 2019, 82 countries had conducted a JEE, but only five of these countries were EU Member States (Belgium, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia) (World Health Organisation, 2019b). Once all EU28 countries have completed a JEE, analysis of the association with IDTE will need to be revisited.",

This association is important in view of competing demands for limited public health resources that pitches preparedness planning versus other dire public health needs. Advancing pandemic preparedness and response, upgrading public health systems, and research and development in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries is projected to cost $4.5 billion per year (Sands, Mundaca\u2010Shah, et al., 2016). Our analysis suggests that IHR core capacities capture the foundations of preparedness and that IHR deficiencies are therefore operational rather than structural. In 2014, the IHR Review Committee highlighted the need to: strengthen self\u2010assessment; test capacities through simulations; promote regional and cross\u2010regional learning; and measure performance through peer\u2010review and external assessments (World Health Organisation, 2015). Our study can guide preparedness measures in Europe and elsewhere for the prevention of IDTE as, ultimately, health security depends on transparent implementation of IHR core capacities and shared accountability in an interconnected and interdependent world. IHR core capacity implementation can advance systemic resilience to cross\u2010border IDTE in Europe.",
