During periods of active viral replication, these changes occur in multiple classes of molecules, including mRNAs and proteins (1, 2). Infected cells exhibit decreased basic functionality, e.g., in cell signaling (3), culminating in the eventual death of the cell. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we recently profiled the transcriptome of HIV-infected lymphoblastoid cells and found that over half of the detectable polyadenylated RNA species were differentially expressed (DE) during infection (1). These changes corroborated clinical results. For example, in CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals, a distinct expression profile was observed comprising 260 genes whose expression correlated with viral load; these genes were involved in a variety of functions, including inflammatory signaling, cell cycle, and antigen presentation (4).",

NGS applied to small RNA (small RNA-Seq) circumvents this limitation, detecting microRNAs without the need for prior annotation as well as extending quantitation over a wider dynamic range.

In this article, we report the use of NGS to observe dynamic changes in cellular small RNAs from HIV-infected CD4+ cells. To this end, we sampled multiple time points, including those preceding detectable HIV replication, to identify signatures of different stages of infection in vitro. To characterize microRNAs, both known and putatively novel, we then integrated our NGS data set with mRNA-Seq data derived from the same experimental samples (1) and thereby identified microRNAs that may contribute to phenotypic changes in infected cells over time. We also provide a full account of putatively novel microRNAs and other small RNAs that were DE upon infection that may in turn provide new avenues for future research.",

In a previous study (1), we found that levels of virus were nearly undetectable at 4 hpi, increasing at 12 hpi and peaking at 24 hpi. Our choice of timing parallels these time points. For controls, we also mock-infected cells using cell culture medium or alternatively infected cells with UV-inactivated HIV-1 (HIVUV). Small RNAs were then size selected, and cDNA libraries were generated and then sequenced by NGS. To analyze the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we employed a workflow that included mapping sequences to different small RNA annotations, identifying DE microRNAs based on the mapped data, and determining the mRNA targets of the DE microRNAs (Fig. 1).",

After filtering by a minimum criterion for expression, we found that 155 piRNAs were expressed in the small RNA data set at 12 and 24 hpi; of these, none were DE at 12 hpi, and 21 were DE at 24 hpi, with the majority being upregulated (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). We also found that 531 annotated microRNAs were expressed in the small RNA data set. Levels of expression varied broadly. In particular, a small number of microRNAs were highly expressed. Four microRNAs constituted over half of all microRNA-mapped reads, and 10 microRNAs accounted for over 70% of all microRNA-mapped reads (see Fig. S1B). Among the most highly expressed were several members of the miR-181 family (miR-181a-1, -181b-1, -181d) and let-7 family (let-7a-1, -7f-1) (see Fig. S1B). In contrast, a large number of microRNAs were detected at low levels. Two hundred sixty-three microRNAs had normalized mean read counts of less than 100 in each sample. Overall, the small RNA-Seq data set displayed the broad dynamic range characteristic of NGS data sets with read counts spanning five orders of magnitude (from 1 to over 150,000 mapped reads for the least and most highly expressed species, respectively). These results were consistent with other small RNA-Seq studies, e.g., Peng et al. (12), where over half of the mapped microRNAs from influenza- and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-infected mouse lungs were attributable to three microRNAs.",

By applying DESeq, we found that small numbers of microRNAs were DE at 5 and 12 hpi (numbers of microRNAs are in Table 1; expression values and microRNA IDs are in Fig. S2A to C in the supplemental material; full information is in Table S1 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, similar numbers of microRNAs were detected as DE in HIV-infected cells and HIVUV-infected cells at these time points (Table 1; see also Fig. S2D to F and Table S1). In contrast, at 24 hpi, a larger number of microRNAs were found DE, approximately 7-fold the number DE at 5 and 12 hpi (Table 1; see also Fig. S2C and Table S1). This expansion was specific to infection with live virus, as cells infected with HIVUV continued to show small numbers of DE genes at 24 hpi (Table 1; see also Fig. S2F and Table S1). This expansion in the number of DE microRNAs was similar to the expansion observed for DE mRNAs in the same samples (1), indicating that microRNA and mRNA expression were similarly affected by HIV-1 infection. However, out of those microRNAs found DE in HIVUV-infected cells at 24 hpi, the majority (13 out of 18) were also found DE in HIV-infected cells (Table 1), suggesting that a small subset of changes occurring later in cells infected with live virus were attributable to viral attachment or internalization.",

However, by 24 hpi, the majority of these microRNAs were found upregulated relative to mock-infected cells (Fig. 2A and B). This pattern was observed in the majority of DE microRNAs at earlier time points (five out of five downregulated at 5 hpi, and four out of eight downregulated at 12 hpi; Fig. 2A and B). Likewise, many of the microRNAs found DE at 24 hpi but not at earlier time points nonetheless displayed directions of changes in earlier and later time points (see Fig. S2G in the supplemental material). This phased time point specificity suggests that changes in microRNAs tracked specific stages of HIV infection in vitro. Interestingly many of the trends observed in HIV-infected samples were also observed in HIVUV-infected samples, though with reduced magnitudes of change and/or not at statistical significance, indicating that viral attachment or internalization induced a similar but attenuated response, relative to live virus, even later in infection (see Fig. S2G).",

We assumed that annotations with an abundance of target mRNAs were more likely to identify pathways regulated by microRNAs. We also examined the set of microRNA-mRNA interactions associated with each annotation to identify possible hub (highly connected) microRNAs and mRNAs.

Overall, we found that qPCR validated large fold changes in microRNA expression identified by small RNA-Seq, particularly 2-fold or greater upregulation (Fig. 5A to D; see also Fig. S5B to K in the supplemental material). For example, in the small RNA-Seq data set, we observed miR-4792 to be upregulated at 12 hpi and more highly upregulated at 24 hpi (Fig. 2B and 5A). In the qPCR data set, this increase was found to occur more precisely between 12 and 16 hpi (Fig. 5A). Likewise, miR-1248 was expressed at elevated levels at 24 hpi but not at 12 hpi in the small RNA-Seq data set (Fig. 5C). In the qPCR data set, this increase was evident at an intermediate time point, 16 hpi (Fig. 5C). The overall correspondence between qPCR and small RNA-Seq, particularly for upregulated microRNAs, was consistent with previous observations for mRNAs (18).",

(21). By identifying target mRNAs with anticorrelated expression patterns, we implicated one of these DE microRNAs, miR-3607-3p, in the regulation of cell cycle- and transcription-associated mRNAs. HIV infection is known to downregulate cell cycle-related genes (1, 22), and differing levels of regulation with time may reflect evolving requirements of the virus following entry. In particular, the upregulation of cell cycle-related transcription factors prior to replication, mediated by the downregulation of microRNAs such as miR-3607-3p, may result in the internal production of raw materials needed for viral replication or convert host chromatin to an open configuration. In particular, the NFATC3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3) gene, a target of miR-3607-3p in our analysis, encodes a transcription factor that has recently been shown to be involved in T-cell activation (23). Likewise, the TCF7 gene, another predicted target of miR-3607-3p, encodes a T-cell-specific transcription factor (24). Relieving the inhibition of these transcription factors via the suppression of miR-3607-3p and other microRNAs may represent an early event of HIV infection which is reversed later in HIV infection. Consistent with this interpretation, the MYH9 gene (myosin, heavy chain 9, nonmuscle), a target mRNA of miR-3607-3p found downregulated later in infection, was also found to be downregulated in HIV-infected human glomeruli, which may contribute to HIV-associated pathology (25). While we cannot discern the mechanism by which viral entry or internalization might suppress miR-3607-3p and other early DE microRNAs from our data, we speculate that a surface protein such as gp120 initiates a signaling cascade that destabilizes the available pool of miR-3607-3p.",

Of these, eight displayed concordant changes between the two data sets, with complete concordance observed for the most highly expressed microRNAs (let-7e, miR-92, and miR-106a, all with >10,000 reads per sample in uninfected SUP-T1 cells) (26). A similar concordance among highly expressed microRNAs was observed for clinical samples as well. For example, among the DE microRNAs observed in PBMCs from HIV-infected individuals by Houzet et al., four out of the five mostly highly expressed microRNAs (let-7e, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-92, and miR-182, again with >10,000 reads per sample in uninfected SUP-T1 cells) displayed directional concordance (6). Likewise, concordance with the clinical data set from Witwer et al. was evident for highly expressed microRNAs, such as miR-155 (upregulated by 1.5-fold in PBMCs from viremic individuals and by 1.8-fold in our study at 24 hpi) and miR-181b (upregulated by 1.8-fold in PBMCs from viremic individuals and in our study at 24 hpi) (11).

Nevertheless, recent data point to destabilization of target mRNAs as the main mode of microRNA activity (28\u201330); our approach reflects this state of knowledge. In addition, while our approach is based on complementarity of microRNAs to the 3\u2032 UTRs of mRNAs, recent studies suggest that microRNAs may bind other parts of mRNAs, including 5\u2032 UTRs (31, 32). Our approach utilizing predictive algorithms for microRNA-to-3\u2032 UTR complementarity is intended to detect canonical interactions and limit false positives but would necessarily miss these additional possible interactions. Finally, we note that our approach is based ultimately on predictions of sequence complementarity supplemented by expression data. Additional experiments, such as direct cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the RISC complex, would provide more direct verification of the targets that we have identified (33).",

In our study, we detected piRNA expression in an additional T lymphoblast cell line, SUP-T1 cells, providing support for the expression of piRNAs in non-germ-line cells. HIV infection resulted in changes in the expression of 21 piRNAs. piRNAs are hypothesized to function in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms; however, due to a lack of consensus about their function in non-germ-line cells, we report these changes for completeness only (34). We also detected changes in several candidate novel microRNAs. In particular, one candidate encoded in the first intron of EPB41L2 was highly expressed in uninfected cells and strongly downregulated in infected cells. Multiple lines of evidence supported the existence of this microRNA, including ENCODE small RNA-Seq data on multiple immune cell types. Interestingly, Yeung et al. detected a sequence identical to this candidate novel microRNA in the context of HIV infection (8). This small RNA was found to have RNA interference activity toward the HIV-1 RNA primer-binding site where tRNA binds to initiate reverse transcription, and antagomirs directed toward the small RNA resulted in increased HIV-1 replication (8). We find a deeper investigation into the connection between this microRNA and HIV to be outside the scope of the present work. However, in the future it would be interesting to determine whether more direct evidence of the association between this microRNA and HIV-1 RNA could be obtained, such as through immunoprecipitation of the two RNA species in complex.",

Finally, we note that this microRNA displays strong specificity to higher primates, and its presence may reflect a response unique to primates and viruses that target them, such as HIV-1 and HCMV. Unlike known microRNAs, this and other candidate novel microRNAs may represent entirely novel targets for intervention or diagnosis during HIV-1 infection and demonstrate a distinct benefit of applying NGS to the profiling of small RNAs.",

Experimental steps were performed as described in reference 1 but with the following changes. HIVUV was generated by irradiating HIV preparations for 5 min, a dose we found sufficient to abrogate viral replication in MAGI-CXCR4 cells as detected by X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside) staining. Lack of replication with HIVUV was confirmed in SUP-T1 cells by viral mRNA load by TaqMan qPCR (35). Both live virus and UV-inactivated virus were added to 5 \u00d7 106 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. This dose of live virus was found to achieve 100% infection at 24 hpi with ~50% cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Mock infections were performed with an identical volume of SUP-T1-conditioned medium. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and replicates were sampled at 5, 12, and 24 hpi.",

Small RNA sequences were submitted to Geospiza (PerkinElmer, Seattle, WA) for initial analysis. Raw reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequence. Trimmed reads were aligned using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software against a filter reference containing rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and mtRNA sequences (36). The remaining reads were aligned to NCBI build 37.2 of the human genome using BWA and subsequently quantified using genomic annotations for microRNAs (miRBase 17) (7), piRNAs, and known genes (RefSeq gene, build 37.2) or classified as unmapped. MicroRNA read count data were obtained from Geospiza (available at http://viromics.washington.edu). By read count, we refer to the number of cDNA fragments that are sequenced and map to a particular genomic feature. Filtering was performed by requiring \u226510 reads in all the samples of at least one condition for a given microRNA. Normalization was applied to the remaining read count data using DESeq, an R software package for testing differential expression, using R version 2.14.1 (13). Briefly, normalization comprised calculating a size factor for each sample (as the median ratio of read counts for each feature and sample to the geometric mean of read counts for each feature across samples) and dividing all of the read counts in a particular sample by the sample size factor (13). DE microRNAs were determined using negative binomial tests implemented in DESeq, where dispersion was estimated using a fitted, parametric curve. For comparison, data from HCMV-infected fibroblasts was obtained through the Short-Read Archive (study identifier [ID] SRP009246) (17).",
