While it is suspected that MERS-CoV originated in African bats [3], contact with camels is associated with primary human infections. Serological evidence demonstrates that MERS-CoV (or serologically related viruses) have been present in camels in the Middle East and parts of Africa for over 30 years. Studies have found that a high proportion of camels from Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Jordan [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] have antibodies against MERS-CoV. This suggests that widespread exposure to MERS-CoV among camels has been ongoing for an extended period of time. In contrast, serum from other animals that are common in the Middle East including sheep, goats, cattle and horses has not been found to contain antibodies that are reactive to MERS-CoV [7], [8]. Infectious virus has also been isolated from nasal swabs of camels in some of these regions [10], [11].",

Samples were stored at \u2212 25 \u00b0C at Laboratoire Central V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire (LCV) in Bamako, Mali. For the MERS spike protein (S1) ELISA, serum obtained from LCV was diluted 1:1 in 0.2% Triton X \u2212 100 (Sigma), heat inactivated for 15 min. at 65 \u00b0C and subsequently stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. NUNC MaxiSorp plates were coated with recombinant S1 antigen (1 \u03bcg/ml) (Sino Biological) in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Unbound antigen was removed and plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS + 5% non-fat skim milk, 0.05% Tween20). Serum was diluted in blocking solution and added to the plates for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween20. A rabbit anti-llama IgG (H + L) HRP conjugated antibody (AgriSera) was used as the secondary antibody at 1:2000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed, ABTS Peroxidase substrate (KPL) was added and plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min. Plates were subsequently read at 405 nm.

Subsequent analysis of neutralizing activity of the sera from the Nara camels revealed no neutralization titers in a microneutralization assay, further supporting their lack of reactivity (Fig. 1B). At the lowest dilution tested in the MERS-CoV S1 ELISA (1:400), nearly all samples assayed (88%) were positive for antibodies that react to S1. While the positivity decreased with increasing dilution, 70% and 67% of samples respectively were positive at 1:1600 and 1:6400 (Table 1). Even at a dilution of 1:25,600, 24% of samples remained positive. There was no variation in seropositivity between different sampling locations in Kidal province (Fig. 1A). In terms of seropositivity and approximate endpoint dilution, there were no notable differences when animals were categorized by age or sex. When camels were grouped by age (1\u20132, 3\u20138 and 9\u201316 years) neither the seropositivity rate (83, 91, 88%) nor the endpoint dilution were significantly different. Similarly, the seropositivity rate in male (n = 245) and female (n = 328) camels of 86 and 92% respectively was comparable. A small number (n = 10) of serum samples from Malian cattle and sheep were also tested in the S1 ELISA but consistent with reports from other countries [8], [13] were negative. To confirm data from the S1 ELISA, as subset samples (n = 147) were assayed for neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in a microneutralization assay. Of the animals tested, 78% had neutralizing antibodies with a reciprocal titer \u2265 20, with titers up to 1920 (Fig. 2B).",

Thus it seems likely that most regions of Africa with large camel populations that are not geographically isolated will have been exposed to MERS-CoV. This is remarkable given that there has yet to be a confirmed locally acquired human MERS-CoV case identified in Africa, likely due to lack of diagnostic resources and previous lack of general awareness. It is also possible that transmission requires some environmental or activity-based conditions that are more prevalent in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, than in Africa. A serosurvey of human populations in African countries with high numbers of camels would be valuable, as would heightened surveillance for undiagnosed severe respiratory disease. Additionally, sampling of camels for isolation and characterization of viruses would be useful to determine the similarity of viruses circulating in Mali compared to the viruses from the Middle East.",
