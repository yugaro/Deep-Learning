Discovery of occupational infectious diseases had a lot of ripple effects in the field of occupational medicine and industrial hygiene. Occupational infections, including parasitic diseases, can limit the range of applied diagnostic and certification procedures only to diseases induced by pathogenic agents or by exposures occurring in the occupational environment [1]. In some cases, it becomes difficult or even impossible to identify the real cause of patients' complaints. Occupational biohazards are infectious agents or hazardous biological materials that exert harmful effects on workers' health, either directly thorough infection or indirectly through damage to the working environment, and it can also include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus, or toxin from a biological source [2].",

There has been a lot of discussion on biological hazards at work, their diagnosis, and treatment. Known etiological causes of the disease are increasing and include occupational factors [3]. Two main groups of biological agents are regarded as occupational biohazards: (1) allergenic and/or toxic agents forming bioaerosols, causing occupational diseases of the respiratory tract and skin, primarily in agricultural workers; and (2) agents causing zoonoses and other infectious diseases that could be spread by tick or insect vectors, through various exposure routes. Bioaerosols are biological particles of organic dust and/or droplets suspended in the air, such as viruses, bacteria, endotoxin, fungi, secondary metabolites of fungi, particles of feces, bodies of mites and insects, and feather, hair, feces, and urine of birds and mammals. They often induce disorders of the respiratory system or skin [4]. Bioaerosols are a main health problem in agriculture, medical or veterinary facilities, diagnostic laboratories, plants producing biofuel from rape blossoms, the metallurgical industry, libraries, and even art conservation [5].",

Bioaerosols occurring in the agricultural work environments comprise bacteria, fungi, high-molecular-weight polymers produced by bacteria (endotoxin) or fungi (\u03b2-glucans), and low-molecular-weight secondary metabolites of fungi (mycotoxins and volatile organic compounds). It also includes various particles of plant and animal origins. All these agents can cause allergic and/or immunotoxic occupational diseases of respiratory organs (airways inflammation, rhinitis, toxic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and asthma), conjunctivitis, and dermatitis in exposed workers [7]. Very important among zoonotic agents causing occupational diseases are those causing tick-borne diseases. Recently, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by Phlebovirus (SFTS virus) and Tsutsugamushi disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi\n[8] have become serious social problems. Among other infectious, nonzoonotic agents, bloodborne human hepatitis and immunodeficiency viruses [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV)] pose the greatest hazard to HCWs. Of interest are also bacteria causing legionellosis in people occupationally exposed to droplet aerosols, mainly from warm water [9].",

In particular, occupational exposure to infectious agents, such as HIV, HBV, HCV, etc., are devastating to the victims. Infectious disease cases for which compensation is given by the Korean Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service (KCOMWEL) are increasing, and tuberculosis is the most common infectious disease for which HCWs are compensated by KCOMWEL in Korea [6]. Pulmonary diseases are well documented and diverse in many patients with HIV in clinical stages. HIV infection is usually not suspected, and HCWs may not strictly be following the safety principles that are otherwise applied when HIV infection is known or suspected, although universal precautions are routine practices. Therefore, the risk of exposure is highest and HIV transmission to HCWs is most probable [14]. Since its identification in 1985, HIV has challenged several aspects of HCWs. Because HIV is a bloodborne infectious disease, from the early days of the epidemic, concerns were raised about the risks of occupational exposures and infections among HCWs. Despite the development of a highly active antiretroviral therapy, risks of occupational infection with bloodborne pathogens remain in HCWs [15]. HIV infection poses occupational hazards to operating surgeons, especially in tropical Africa where the seroprevalence is so high that seroconversion in medical staff contaminated with the virus is estimated to be 15 times (per annum) more than that observed in developed countries [16].",

Factors such as influenza A (H1N1) vaccine immunization and high-protection-level masks could protect HCWs from the infection of influenza A (H1N1) [17]. An attempt had been made to reflect the state of requirements of occupational health, hygiene, and working conditions with respect to activities of the diagnostics, treatment (also surgical), and handling of such patients. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak of infection with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans, influenza vaccination is recommended as the only way to prevent the infection among HCWs [18]. The H1N1 influenza virus, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, can cause severely adverse effects to women; it also poses special medical challenges to HCWs providing obstetric care, especially during deliveries involving infected women. However, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the risk of nosocomial infection among obstetric care providers was not higher when respiratory infection precautions were followed [19]. HCWs pose a potential risk of transmitting communicable diseases in the hospital settings where they usually work. This review determined influenza vaccination rates among HCWs in three Middle East countries, namely, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman, to identify the different variables associated with the noncompliance of HCWs. Influenza immunization of HCWs in these studied countries was suboptimal, which could be improved through various interventions and educational programs to increase vaccination acceptance among HCWs [20]. HCWs can be the vectors of influenza and cause influenza outbreaks. Data suggested that vaccination of nurses remains suboptimal worldwide [21].",

Employers should provide adequate infection-control training to possibly exposed workers and report notifiable diseases promptly [69]. The most important methods for the prevention of infectious diseases among laboratory workers are to protect them against direct contact with biological material, apply vaccinations, and implement proper postexposure procedures. Appropriate habits of workers are relevant to the prevention of infections in workplaces. It is necessary to develop practical instructions aimed at improving occupational safety to protect this occupational group against harmful effects of biological agents [82]. A relationship between knowledge, risk perception, and vaccination behaviors among nurses was confirmed. The identified sentinel items of knowledge and risk perception can be useful for future vaccination campaigns [21]. A large number of patients with occupational ebola hemorrhagic fever even after the implementation of barrier nursing pointed at the need to strengthen training and supervision of local HCWs [27]. It should be acknowledged that medical diagnostic laboratories pose significantly increased risks to the health of laboratory workers. Therefore, properly worked out and obeyed procedures ensuring safety in work with biological material and microbes, and properly trained laboratory staff play essential roles in reducing the risk. Appropriate qualifications and habits of workers developed through training are of relevance to the prevention of infections in laboratories [82]. A more comprehensive study is required to assess accurately the level of occupational risk to HCWs in the acquisition of ESBL-producing organisms and their onward transmission to household contacts [32]. It also highlights the importance of appropriate laboratory practices for containing infected mosquitoes and preventing contact with potentially infectious material, including the generation of potentially infectious aerosols [37]. Researchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when handling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and public institutions should implement and maintain effective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute illness in laboratory workers [39]. In addition, biowaste management should be supported through appropriate education, training, and commitment of health care staff, management, and health care managers within an effective policy and legislative framework.",

Establishment of national guidelines to standardize monitoring of occupational infection among HCWs would improve health care workplace safety and patient care [83]. To our knowledge, only a few, if any, public agencies provide specific guidelines pertaining to empirical treatment of severe infections for their local HCWs in the event of hospitalization. Local resistance patterns of pathogens in each hospital may assert the necessity of such a guideline [32]. The potential of Brucella for human infection and illness, as well as the intensity, duration, and expense of the follow-up recommended for Brucella exposure, highlights the need for developing standard protocols by facilities to prevent exposures during the handling of marine mammals, particularly during aerosol-generating procedures [35]. It is also important for small-animal veterinarians to minimize their infection risk by practicing recommended infection control procedures. Veterinarians should establish and follow a written infection control plan based on the standardized infection control approach, to minimize their risk of occupational zoonotic infections [57].",

All these agents can be a cause of allergic and/or immunotoxic occupational diseases of respiratory organ (airways inflammation, rhinitis, toxic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and asthma), conjunctivitis, and dermatitis in exposed workers. Among other infectious, nonzoonotic agents, bloodborne human hepatitis and immunodeficiency viruses pose the greatest hazards to HCWs. Of interest are also bacteria causing legionellosis in people occupationally exposed to droplet aerosols, mainly from warm water. Sources of biological hazards include bacteria, viruses, insects, plants, birds, animals, and humans. These hazards can cause a variety of health problems, ranging from skin irritation and allergies to infections (tuberculosis and AIDS), cancer (liver cancer, and HBV or HCV infection), and so on. Several classes of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions, can cause infection. Modes of transmission vary depending on the type of organism; some infectious agents may be transmitted by more than one route: some are transmitted primarily by direct or indirect contact, and others by droplet or airborne routes. Other infectious agents, such as bloodborne viruses (HBV, HCV, and HIV), are transmitted via percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Importantly, not all infectious agents are transmitted from person to person. Infection is the result of a complex interrelationship between a potential host and an infectious agent. Most of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and severity of disease are related to the host. However, characteristics of the host\u2013agent interaction, as it relates to pathogenicity, virulence, and antigenicity, are also important, as are the infectious dose, mechanisms of disease production, and route of exposure.",

They apply to all situations where workers have risk of exposure to blood or certain body fluids, and aim at preventing exposure to bloodborne diseases transmitted through needlestick accidents or by fluid contact with an open wound, nonintact skin, or mucous membranes. Education programs for workers about personal hygiene practices should emphasize that careful hand washing is extremely important in the prevention of diseases. Workers should be informed about using appropriate protective clothing and removing it at the end of the shift. They should also be informed about the necessity of washing hands frequently, and prior to eating, drinking, or smoking; they should also avoid nail biting. Many vaccines are available. Some of them are mandatory for specific occupational groups (HBV vaccine for HCWs) in many countries, some are occasionally mandatory (BCG for HCWs), and some are just recommended (tetanus for construction workers). Training in laboratory practice is a very important aspect of staff protection. Guidelines published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) in preventing the transmission of tuberculous infection in health care settings must be adhered to [19].

We concentrated on literatures published after 2010 that attempted to detect biological hazards to humans, especially workers, and the efforts to protect them against these factors. In addition, this review briefly describes these factors, providing examples of their adverse health effects, risk assessments, protection with personal protective equipment, prevention with training of workers, regulations, as well as vaccinations.",

Education programs for workers about personal hygiene practices should emphasize that careful hand washing is extremely important in the prevention of diseases. Workers should be informed about using appropriate protective clothing and removing it at the end of the shift. Many vaccines are available. Some of them are mandatory in many countries, for specific occupational groups. Training in laboratory practice is a very important aspect of staff protection. Guidelines and even a few brief commentaries are offered on effective measures for the control and prevention of occupational infectious diseases and their transmission among workers.",

This handbook provides precise information on biological hazardous agents at the workplace, to protect workers. More effective classification systems of occupational infectious diseases was presented, thereby distinguishing biologically hazardous agents, the occupations, industries, infectious diseases, and connecting them to the related workers. It is expected to generate the major infectious occupational-related biological factors, focusing on this handbook with a total of 60 species, and used with convenience for practical utility.",
