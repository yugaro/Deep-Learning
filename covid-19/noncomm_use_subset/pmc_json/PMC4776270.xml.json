It is known as having a high fatality rate and having a resemblance in clinical features with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2], thus, it has drawn much concern both from the public health authority and the general public when the first index case was identified in May 2015, for the first time in Korea.",

It was surprising because South Korea has been said to have one of the most advanced medical and public health systems in the world [4], and it raises fears that the situation would be much worse in countries with less developed public health systems. Thus, the investigation of this study about the South Korean incidence is expected to give an invaluable lesson both to public health authorities around the world and the community of epidemiology researchers. Moreover, it might be able to provide a quantified result with mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, which is beneficial given that the studies about the South Korean case are largely comprised of epidemiological descriptions 4, 5.",

Breban et al [11] compared the possibility of MERS-CoV being pandemic by comparing the basic reproduction number (Appendix) with that of SARS. Using MERS-CoV outbreak data, Chowell et al [12] delved further and calculated two reproduction numbers based on different epidemiological scenarios: one is when all reported zoonotic cases are severe and the other is not. Chowell et al [3] took a different approach that compared the reproduction numbers in SARS and MERS-CoV in large hospital clusters.",

While a few researches have dealt with the South Korean case, as briefly mentioned above, research gaps still exist that need to be filled. First of all, whether some demographic characteristics, such as age or sex, and locations have influence on the possibility of being infected needs to be explored. Also, the transmissibility needs to be investigated with more detail. As done in some literature, transmissibility in hospitals and in general need to be calculated separately and it needs to be taken into consideration whether the transmissibility might change in time. Here, the SIR-type mathematical modeling is of great use, while there are very few in MERS-CoV studies. Its usefulness might be boosted if combined with real-world data, which will be done in the present study.",

It categorizes each individual into one of six epidemiological classes; susceptible (S), exposed (or high-risk latent) (E), symptomatic and infectious (I), infection but asymptomatic class (A), hospitalized (H), and recovery class (R). It is assumed that only infectious and hospitalized individuals can infect others and asymptomatic individuals cannot. In Chowell et al [12], the actual data of the zoonotic case were gathered so they were able to take secondary cases as well as index cases into account. By contrast, there was no zoonotic transmission except the primary case in South Korea, thus we do not consider the zoonotic case of MERS-CoV model in the present study. The model takes the following form:(1)dSdt=\u2212S\u03b2(I+lH)NdEdt=S\u03b2(I+lH)N\u2212\u03baEdIdt=\u03ba\u03c1E\u2212(\u03b3a+\u03b3I)IdAdt=\u03ba(1\u2212\u03c1)EdHdt=\u03b3aI\u2212\u03b3rHdRdt=\u03b3II+\u03b3rHwhere \u03b2 is the human-to-human transmission rate per unit time (day) and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients; \u03ba is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic or asymptomatic); \u03c1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I, and (1\u2212\u03c1) is that of progression to asymptomatic class; A; \u03b3a is the average rate at which symptomatic individuals hospitalize and \u03b3I is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; \u03b3r isthe recovery rate of hospitalized patients. Using these parameters, we will estimate the transmission rate (\u03b2) and transmissibility of hospitalized (l) in next section.",

The average age of MERS-CoV confirmed cases is 55 years and that of death patients is 69.8 years, while that of the total population in South Korea is 38.9 years in 2015. These differences were statistically significant and age is related both to susceptibility and mortality of MERS-CoV. Next, Chi-square test was conducted in order to investigate whether sex, region, and/or visited hospital had any relationship with mortality of MERS-CoV. The result shows that mortality was different by region and visited hospital, while it was not by sex. We also tested whether patients' sex was different by age, region, and/or category of patients (health workers, epidemiological survey, or visitor/family). According to the result, the sex of patients was not related to age and region, but it was significantly different by the category of patients. Finally, we investigated whether sex, region, and mortality are related to the number of cases by generation; in other words, it was investigated whether mortality increased or decreased as the disease spread further. The result of Chi-square test demonstrates that the number of cases by generation was not related to age while it was different by region and mortality (more details are given in Appendix).",

The MERS-CoV incidence is defined as the number of newly infected individuals per day. The figure demonstrates that our fitted MERS-CoV model fits well to the reported incidence data. In the figure, we can see the trend of logistic curve; thus, we split up the time into two periods (May 6, June 7 and June 7, July 1) where the rate of change is in its increasing and decreasing trend respectively. Due to the implementation of intensive interventions at June 7, each period has its own remarkable trend, thus, parameters are estimated in each period. Two kinds of transmission rates are estimated\u2014transmission rate \u03b2 and transmissibility of hospitalized patients l\u2014because many MERS-CoV patients are infected in hospitals and it is assumed that the value of hospitalized transmissibility l is bigger than transmission rate \u03b2. Parameter values used for simulation are listed in Table 2.",

This raises the importance of timely and accurate countermeasures. In order to devise efficient intervention strategies, it is critical to understand both the biological characteristics of the disease and the social response of the location where the disease spreads or is likely to spread. It is because these two aspects in combination determine the mode of diffusion of the infectious disease. In this regard, it is crucial to investigate the characteristics of MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea since it can demonstrate the current capability and the future potential of South Korea to resist infectious disease. This study tried to meet this need by examining which demographic group is more susceptible using incidence data and estimating transmission rates of general and hospitalized populations. The result of this study is expected to have theoretical and practical implications.",

Also, the role of the media in the spread of MERS-CoV in South Korea can be investigated.
