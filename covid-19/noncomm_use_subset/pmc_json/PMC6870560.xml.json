However, this approach is hindered by the high genetic variability of the virus, due to both mutation and recombination events, resulting in the continuous emergence of new variants with generally poor cross-protection (Bande et al., 2015). Multiple vaccines, either live attenuated or inactivated, are usually combined in the attempt to obtain a proper protection: the protection against a certain variant may be achieved by administering either a single vaccination based on a strain of the same lineage (homologous vaccination) or multiple vaccines based on different lineages to broaden the protection spectrum, following the so-called \u201cprotectotype\u201d concept (heterologous vaccination) (Cook et al., 1999; Jordan, 2017).",

The impact of vaccination protocols on circulating strains, which include field, live-vaccine and also \u201cvaccine-derived\u201d strains, proved remarkable and some lineages even disappeared after the discontinuance of homologous vaccination (Franzo et al., 2014, 2016). Live vaccine strains may spread to unvaccinated flocks, regain virulence because of rolling-like reactions or recombine with other circulating strains, possibly resulting in the emergence of new variants (Matthijs et al., 2008; Jackwood and Lee, 2017; Moreno et al., 2017). In addition, their use has been suggested to increase IBV mutation rate by applying an immunologic pressure on the field population (Jackwood et al., 2012). The persistence of vaccine strains also complicates IBV diagnosis, since many detected strains are usually closely related or identical to the applied vaccines (Jackwood and Lee, 2017). Therefore, clearly vaccination protocols must be taken into account to delineate an accurate picture of IBV epidemiological context within a given area.",

Remarkably, the evaluation of the applied vaccination strategies revealed a surprisingly intricate scenario, involving more than 70 different protocols. The most frequent approach for combining multiple IBV vaccines was to apply them simultaneously at 1 doa (83.4%). Despite the fact that separate administrations of 2 or more IBV vaccines are traditionally considered more effective, possibly because of the booster effect and respiratory epithelium recovery between the applications (Cook et al., 1999; De Wit et al., 2010), nowadays the combined administration at 1 doa is commonly adopted in different countries (Franzo et al., 2016; Jordan, 2017). In fact, hatchery vaccination allows a higher standardization and broader vaccine coverage than field vaccination (Franzo et al., 2016) and at the same time eliminates the need of a second administration, thus reducing the costs. The present study also confirms this trend in Poland. Unfortunately, the limited number of farms applying separate vaccinations and the negligible number of symptomatic flocks prevented the comparison of the efficacy of the 2 strategies. Nonetheless, the relatively low amount of detected field strains (17.2%) and clinical outbreaks (4.4%) seems to support the efficacy of widespread vaccination, regardless of the adopted strategy.",

Since 92.7% of them were of vaccine origin (4/91, 1/96, or CR88-like), the high prevalence of this lineage may be due to the vast application of 793B vaccines, administered in 83.2% of the sampled flocks. Interestingly, although Mass vaccines were provided even more frequently (97.6% of the times) and often together with the 793B ones, Mass strains were only found in 5 samples. The more frequent detection of 793B strains may be explained by 793B vaccines persisting longer and/or reaching higher titers than the Mass ones in field conditions (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Tucciarone et al., 2018).",

While D274-like strains were found only twice in D274-vaccinated flocks, the relevance of QX and variant 2 as field lineages is well known. QX was detected for the first time in China in 1996 and, as of today, it is probably the most important field lineage in both Asia and Europe (Franzo et al., 2017a). It is responsible for severe economic losses, causing respiratory and renal symptoms and is also associated to the \u201cfalse-layer syndrome\u201d in breeding and laying hens (De Wit et al., 2011). Variant 2 is an emerging lineage that, after staying confined to Israel for nearly a decade following its first detection in 1998 (Callison et al., 2001), spread firstly to the whole Middle East, then to Turkey and Eastern Europe (Ganapathy et al., 2015; Yilmaz et al., 2016; Franzo et al., 2017b). Poland is the first European country where this nephropathogenic variant was detected in 2015, and the threat of its remarkable clinical impact has elicited the introduction of a homologous vaccine (Lisowska et al., 2017). Of the 9 QX detections, 3 vaccine strains were detected in QX-vaccinated flocks, 2 were labeled as vaccine-derived strains, and 4 as field ones. Variant 2 strains were detected in 84 samples: 26 were classified as vaccine, 8 as vaccine-derived, and 51 as field strains, highlighting the persistence of this lineage in Poland in the considered period. Therefore, the relevance of these lineages in Poland appears to be modest, especially from a clinical perspective.",

Notably, 89.3% of the detected vaccine-derived strains were 4/91-like ones. In all 72.8% of the 4/91 detections occurred in farms not adopting this vaccine, as opposed to 6.4% and none of the 1/96 and CR88 detections: the significant difference (P-value < 0.001) suggests a higher spreading capability of the 4/91 vaccine compared to the 1/96-based one, as previously reported (Franzo et al., 2014; Pellattiero et al., 2018). Several causes could justify the observed scenario, including a higher vaccine shedding or longer persistence. Although unlikely, an underling association between farm management and employed vaccine, favoring the dispersion of specific vaccines, cannot totally be excluded.",

When Mass and/or 793B vaccines are administered at 1 doa, their titers are expected to peak approximatively at 10 to 14 doa, way before the average age of sampling in this study (i.e., 35.7 doa), and then gradually decrease (Tucciarone et al., 2018). This was confirmed by the fact that one of the applied vaccines was detected 90% of the times when birds were sampled before 16 doa, as opposed to 45.6% of the times when they had 16 or more doa. Therefore, it seems plausible that field and vaccine-derived strains could penetrate in a farm after the applied vaccines decline. Since most of discordances between applied and detected vaccines occurred within the 793B lineage, further efforts should be directed to investigate the causes behind the limited protection from infection even between homologous vaccines.",

These strains were classified as 793B (13 detections, of which 10 4/91-like vaccine-derived strains and 3 field ones), Variant 2 (7 field strains) and QX (1 field strain). In fact, while a link between symptoms and detections of variant 2, QX, and 793B field strains can easily be justified, the detection of 4/91-like strains in symptomatic animals should draw attention to the possible pathogenic role of vaccine-derived strains. The number of vaccine-derived and field strains detected in symptomatic flocks is substantially equal, and this should stimulate a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of a widespread, poorly-planned vaccine application. However, these findings are not conclusive. Even when overt clinical signs are observed, it is practically impossible to certainly determine based solely on molecular analyses if the detected strain is a truly pathogenic one or a virus of vaccine origin incidentally detected in presence of other causative pathogens (Jackwood and Lee, 2017). Moreover, no genetic markers are currently known to consistently distinguish between vaccine and field strains (Jackwood and Lee, 2017). Although a combination of phylogenetic and epidemiological criteria was adopted in the present study to confidently classify sequenced strains, the presence of some misclassification due to the circulation of actual field strains closely related (at least in the considered genomic region) to vaccine viruses cannot be excluded and will deserve more extensive evaluations, possibly based on the entire S1 gene sequence. Nonetheless, besides the potential direct cost of vaccine-induced clinical signs, the endemic circulation of vaccine strains has other effects on IBV epidemiology, increasing the likelihood of recombination events and the genesis of strains with unpredictable features. As demonstrated in the present study, their persistence also severely complicates the interpretation of the epidemiological scenario and thus the planning of effective control strategies.",

To cope with the relatively limited IBV challenge, an outstanding high number of different vaccination protocols were observed.
