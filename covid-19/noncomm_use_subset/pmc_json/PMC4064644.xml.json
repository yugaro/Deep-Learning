These recommendations, which were disseminated through the mass media, were given because the spread of influenza A/H1N1 virus and prevalence of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) had recently increased [2,5].",

In the UK, < 40% of the public followed the recommended guidelines for preventing swine influenza during the outbreak [8]. There are few data on the associations between H1N1-related preventive behaviors, their perceived effectiveness, and anxiety that account for possible confounding by household, health behavior, and ILI factors in a nationally representative Korean population [5,8].

The CHS used a two-stage sampling process. The first stage was to apply a probability proportional to size sampling strategy (to select primary sampling units) and the second stage was to apply systematic sampling (selecting households). The sampling frame was based on 2009 Resident Registration Data. There were 22,088 primary sampling units, each containing five households. Thus 110,440 households were selected for interviews, and 230,716 individuals (107,080 men and 123,636 women) aged \u2265 19 years completed the interview-based survey. For this study, an additional survey was conducted on residents of three urban and two rural areas that were randomly selected from the CHS. There were 300 primary sampling units, each containing five households. Thus 1500 households were selected for interviews, and 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged \u2265 19 years completed the additional survey. The survey was conducted during February\u2013March 2010. All participants gave their written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KCDC.",

In particular, we aimed to evaluate the independent effects of perceived effectiveness and anxiety on the scores. Model 1 included general participant characteristics as independent variables. Model 2 was the same as Model 1, with the addition of health behaviors and physician-diagnosed chronic diseases. In Model 3, ILI, perceived effectiveness, and anxiety were added to the suite of variables included in Model 2. All of the models were statistically significant, and the adjusted R2 values were 0.227, 0.239, and 0.367 respectively. Sex, region, age, marital status, housing, and education (\u2265 7 years) were significant predictors of behavior scores in all models (all p < 0.05). After controlling for these variables, moderate (\u03b2 = 2.529, p < 0.001) and high (\u03b2 = 3.577, p < 0.001) perceived effectiveness scores were associated with higher preventive behavior scores. Similarly, moderate (\u03b2 = 1.516, p < 0.001) and high (\u03b2 = 4.103, p < 0.001) anxiety scores were associated with higher preventive behavior scores (Table 4).",

            "text": "The WHO emphasized that hand washing is a very important action that can control the prevalence of influenza [12]. A recent randomized trial showed that a combination of facemasks and hand hygiene among the contacts of influenza cases reduces transmission within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms [13]. In our study, 70.3% of respondents said that during the H1N1 pandemic they washed their hands with soap more often than usual, 19.2% said that they often cleaned frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, 22% said that they reduced their use of public transport, and 31% said that they avoided crowded places. Our participants also showed a high level of behavioral compliance, i.e., they put what they said into practice. In a cross-sectional telephone survey spanning the UK, only 28.1% of respondents said that they washed their hands with soap more often than usual during the H1N1 pandemic, whereas 17.3% responded that they often cleaned frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, and only 3.7% said that they avoided crowded places [8]. In our study, 2679 (77.4%) respondents said that they put at least one of the eight preventive actions into practice (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d or \u201ctend to agree\u201d) and 275 (7.9%) said that they performed all eight actions. In the UK-based study, 4.9% of respondents performed at least one of six avoidance behaviors and 37.8% performed at least one of three recommended behaviors [8]. The results of that study differed from ours in that most of their respondents (62.0%) said that they did not perform any of the preventive actions. The discrepancies between the two study results can be first explained by ethnic differences in the study populations. Although our study population was all Korean and thus difficult to compare with other ethnicities, the UK-based study made a distinction between white and other ethnicities. Although most of their respondents were white (92.6%), the people in the \u201cother\u201d category were 3.2 times more likely to put the recommended behaviors into practice, and 4.1 times more likely to carry out avoidance behaviors than the white respondents. Second, there is a difference in the survey methods used between the two studies. Our study was based on face-to-face interviews and the study in the UK was based on telephone interviews. Third, considering that all of the studied countries conducted extensive nationwide campaigns about the recommended behaviors, the differences between the two results may be partly explained by differences in perceived effectiveness and anxiety between the study populations. Risk perceptions are defined by the perceived seriousness of a health threat and perceived personal vulnerability [14]. During the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong, only 26.8% of respondents believed that they might become infected with the virus [10]. Similarly, a study showed that although 43% of respondents thought that becoming infected with the H1N1 influenza would severely affect their health, only 21% of them thought that they might become infected [14]. In our study, although 33% of respondents thought that becoming infected with the H1N1 influenza would severely affect their health, a comparatively high 54% of the respondents believed they might become infected.",

To promote population behavioral changes, it is important for the mass media to provide prompt and accurate information. According to a previous study, 90.5% of participants received daily information about SARS during the Hong Kong epidemic. The most common source of information was TV (89.8%) followed by newspapers (71.1%), and radio (27.1%) [6]. We had similar findings, in that most of our participants (88.5%) said that they obtained information from the TV, radio, and newspapers. Among our participants, 37.7% placed the most amount of trust in information from health care providers, 29.9% in broadcasters, and 19.9% in the government, which demonstrates the need for interventions from these groups (Figure 2).",

Although behaviors may change according to the different stages, it can be assumed that because we conducted our survey in 2010 we surveyed behavioral patterns at stage 6, i.e., the final stage. Third, we were unable to fully explore the effects of having experienced ILI symptoms on the uptake of preventive behaviors because they were experienced by so few of the participants. Although Model 3 showed significantly higher behavioral scores among people who had experienced symptoms similar to those of H1N1 (p = 0.022), these results require further study.",
