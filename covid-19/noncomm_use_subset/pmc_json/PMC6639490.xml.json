            "text": "Diarrhea remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal dairy calves despite efforts to decrease the incidence of diarrhea through colostral management, sanitation, and housing. Diarrhea caused by salmonellosis can lead to substantially higher mortality in outbreaks, particularly in calves within the first few weeks of life.1 Preventing these early\u2010life Salmonella infections is particularly difficult because no vaccines are labeled for use in young calves. Extra\u2010label use of commercially available vaccines has not been effective2 and is anecdotally associated with clinically relevant adverse effects. Colostral immunity stimulated by vaccinating dry cows for Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus has been used extensively in the dairy and beef industries to protect calves against diarrhea challenge.3, 4 Previous data also indicate that vaccination of dry cows can decrease fecal shedding of Salmonella in young calves.5, 6, 7 However, the concept of using dry cow vaccination to decrease clinical disease caused by Salmonella in calves has not been well examined.",

When fed to calves within the first hours of life, this colostrum led to a significant increase in the calves' Salmonella Newport antibody titers.8 This finding suggests that dry cow vaccination and subsequent colostrum administration may be a viable method to provide immunity against Salmonella in neonatal calves, potentially decreasing the incidence, severity, and mortality of the infection. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the extent of protection from a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge in calves fed colostrum from cows vaccinated with a Salmonella Newport SRP subunit vaccine. We hypothesized that administration of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a Salmonella Newport SRP subunit vaccine would decrease mortality in calves fed with this colostrum and challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium.",

All cows were identified by a colored neckband and housed together on a grass lot with access to a total mixed ration. The cows were vaccinated between March and June 2016 at the NC State Dairy Education Unit, a 200\u2010cow dairy. All mature cows (no heifers were included) that were entering their dry period during this time were eligible to be included, but we ensured that no cows from our previous studies of Salmonella vaccination8, 9 were included in either group. Cows were enrolled 2\u20103 at a time into each group. Two cows were eliminated and replaced because they calved before administration of the booster. At calving, colostrum from each enrolled cow was collected into gallon bags (Perfect Udder, Dairy Tech, Inc., Greeley, Colorado) within 4 hours of calving, labeled, and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. A separate aliquot of colostrum from each cow was frozen at \u221220\u00b0C for determination of the colostral anti\u2010Salmonella titer. Once colostrum from all 30 cows was collected, the bags were gently thawed, mixed into either the control (CTL) or vaccinated (VAX) pool, and realiquoted in gallon bags and refrozen.",

The source was a clinical isolate originally obtained from a calf submitted to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. A single colony of the Salmonella Typhimurium was grown overnight in tryptic soy broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C with gentle shaking. The next morning, a volume with the expected concentration of Salmonella Typhimurium was mixed with 1 L of milk replacer and 2.5 g of sodium bicarbonate, 2.5 g of magnesium trisilicate, and 2.5 g magnesium hydroxide to alkalinize the abomasum.10 Slight differences in inoculum dose occurred based on variability in the overnight growth of the isolate. The inoculum in milk was fed to the calf at the morning feeding on day 0. The calf then received the remainder of its feeding (2 L). The milk replacer was mixed with deionized non\u2010chlorinated water to prevent interference with infection because of chlorination. A 1 mL aliquot of the overnight culture was diluted in sterile phosphate buffered saline 10\u2010fold and plated in triplicate onto 5% Columbia blood agar plates for confirmation of the starting bacterial concentration.

The majority of these samples were positive in both groups, indicating rapid spread from the intestinal lumen into the submucosa, draining lymph nodes, and gall bladder. These findings are supported by the histologic, immunohistochemical and ex vivo assessments of intestinal damage. Spread of Salmonella in calves is primarily via the fecal oral route.12 Therefore, reduction in fecal shedding by calves could be of benefit in controlling the infection on farms. Unfortunately, there was no measureable impact of feeding colostrum from vaccinated cows on the number of calves shedding Salmonella or the number of days that calves were fecal positive for Salmonella.

This measurement (TER) provides a sensitive measure of tissue integrity,16 because changes are almost exclusively a result of loss of intercellular tight junctions and increases in paracellular movement of ions.17 Transepithelial electrical resistance has been used to assess epithelial cell loss and damage from a variety of causes including ischemia, bile injury, and infection.18, 19, 20 Our finding that there was no difference in TER between the CTL and VAX calves suggests similar severity of epithelial damage, which is supported by the histologic scoring.",

In a previous study, vaccination of cows with a killed bacterin at 2 months and again 1 month before calving decreased shedding of Salmonella after PO challenge with Salmonella Typhimurium at 2 days of age as compared to calves born to unvaccinated cows.6 However, the study did not evaluate the effects of vaccination on clinical signs or calf mortality. In another study done at a large California dairy that had a high prevalence of salmonellosis, 150 cows received 2 doses of a killed (autogenous) Salmonella Montevideo bacterin before calving, another 150 cows received a single dose of a modified live Salmonella Choleraesuis vaccine and 150 cows were unvaccinated controls. Calves that received colostrum from cows that had been given the modified live vaccine had a significant reduction in Salmonella shedding as compared to calves from the other 2 groups, but there was no significant difference in mortality.7 In another study, a group of cows received a killed Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine at 7 weeks and again at 2 weeks before calving whereas another group was left unvaccinated.5 Calves were left with their dam for 48 hours to ingest colostrum, and then were given a PO Salmonella Typhimurium challenge at 5 days of age. Mortality in the calves that received colostrum from vaccinated calves was only 10% (2 of 20) as compared to 58% (7 of 12) in calves that received colostrum from unvaccinated cows. Calves fed vaccinated colostrum also had significantly shorter periods of Salmonella shedding in feces after challenge, and after a 28\u2010day period, these calves were less frequently culture positive for Salmonella from the gastrointestinal tract (including ruminal, cecal, and colon contents) and mesenteric lymph nodes. The PO administration of Salmonella\u2010specific egg yolk antibodies (IgY) also has been shown to confer dose\u2010dependent protection against a Salmonella Dublin and a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge in calves suggesting that the presence of mucosal antibody can protect against disease.21\n",

Little data exist about what constitutes a protective titer in calves, but potentially the titers in our study were not high enough to be protective. Additionally, we did not measure titers at the time of infection, and the reported titers may not truly reflect the status of the calves at 2 weeks of age. In most of the studies discussed above, Salmonella challenge occurred between 2 and 5 days of age, and perhaps protection from colostral immunity had waned significantly by the time we challenged the calves in our study (days 10\u201012). The rate of decay for colostral antibodies does appear to vary for different pathogens,22 and the persistence of colostrum\u2010derived Salmonella immunoglobulins from this subunit vaccine is unknown. If rapid immunoglobulin elimination is the reason for the lack of protection, using passive transfer of immunity to prevent salmonellosis in neonatal calves is unlikely to be a successful strategy.",

However, cell\u2010mediated immunity also is critical to protection from Salmonella.12 Although this subunit vaccine can stimulate cell\u2010mediated immunity in mice,23 it is unknown if it is transferred to calves via colostrum. We chose to use pooled colostrum so that each calf would receive the same concentration of Salmonella antibodies and limit potential variability. One disadvantage of this design is that it necessitated the use of frozen colostrum, which would negate any potential benefit from maternally derived T cells. Furthermore, the absorption and activity of colostral leukocytes may be decreased when colostrum is from a cow other than the calf's dam, but this situation has not yet been fully studied. Some evidence in swine indicates cell\u2010mediated immunity was decreased in piglets immediately cross\u2010fostered to other sows after birth.24 Colostral leukocytes can be absorbed through the intestine of the calf primarily via the follicle\u2010associated epithelium of Peyer's patches.25 The majority of these cells are T\u2010lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+) that once through the intestinal barrier can migrate along the lymphatics and recirculate to different organs including the liver and spleen.25, 26 Although the exact function of these maternally derived lymphocytes is not clear, increasing evidence suggests that they are involved in the early immune function of the calf.27, 28 These cells are likely important in the development of neonatal monocytes, allowing more effective presentation of antigen as well as development and activation of neonatal lymphocytes.29, 30 A recent study also suggested that maternal colostral cells had long\u2010term effects on the development of the calf's immune system.31 Calves that received whole colostrum had stronger responses to vaccination 6 to 10 months post\u2010colostrum feeding as compared to calves fed cell\u2010free colostrum. This observation suggests that these maternal cells may play a role in \u201ctraining\u201d or \u201cpriming\u201d the developing immune system of the calf. Therefore, it is possible that the feeding of fresh colostrum to calves from cows vaccinated for Salmonella Newport would have produced better protection in this challenge model.",

The isolate used was obtained from a necropsy sample, and was associated with substantial mortality in our study. Potentially, some protection may have been seen had a less pathogenic isolate been used. Furthermore, the dose of Salmonella administered may be higher than that typically encountered in the clinical situation. Unfortunately, other isolates and lower inoculation doses without abomasal alkalization did not reliably induce clinical disease in a small pilot study before this trial. The 2 cycles of freezing and thawing of the colostrum could have decreased the IgG content of the colostrum that was fed, and decreased any protective effect in the calves. Regardless, the colostrum from vaccinated cows did induce a significant increase in serum titers in the VAX group. We did not assess transfer of passive immunity in the calves. Although every effort was made to optimize transfer of colostral antibodies in both groups, there could have been differences in the total IgG transferred, which may have influenced our results.",

This could have inadvertently biased the overall colostral quality in 1 group because this was not assessed. Second, calves were not randomly allocated to treatment groups before the study. Because treatments were randomly applied to the calves as they were born, this approach should have limited the bias introduced by this error, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this approach inadvertently influenced our findings. Measurement of passive transfer of immunity in the calves would have provided some assurance that the lack of randomization did not bias our findings, but this measurement was not done. Finally, the small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn because the study was underpowered to demonstrate differences in mortality. We erroneously calculated sample size by treating mortality as a continuous instead of a binary variable. Because of this error, the likelihood of missing a difference in mortality when a difference truly exists is increased. The lack of appropriate randomization and sample size calculation preclude the application of these findings to clinical practice, but the results still are valuable to inform future investigations.",
