This was the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV infections outside Middle East Asia, and necessitated the rapid expansion of laboratories to conduct MERS-CoV testing in a short period, as well as the use of assays that had not been approved for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, an urgent external quality assessment (EQA) was proposed in order to assess the quality of the assays used.",

Briefly, a 25-\u00b5L reaction was prepared with 5 \u00b5L of RNA, 1 \u00b5L of each primer, 0.5 \u00b5L of probe, 1 \u00b5L of enzyme mix, and 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer. Reverse transcription was done at 55\u2103 for 20 min, and PCR cycling conditions were 94\u2103 for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 94\u2103 for 15 sec, 58\u2103 for 30 sec. The EQA samples were shipped frozen on dry ice by a specialist courier. The following information was collected from the participants: assay kit and platform used, cut-off CT value, and the results for each material.",

            "text": "Recently, an international EQA of molecular diagnostics for MERS-CoV was conducted across 106 laboratories from six continents; this is the only published report on EQA of MERS-CoV testing [8]. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first EQA of MERS-CoV testing conducted in an affected region during an outbreak worldwide. The Korean outbreak of 2015 was the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV infection outside Middle East Asia, which demanded a rapid expansion of MERS-CoV testing laboratories. Unapproved commercial kits for in vitro diagnostic use were introduced to clinical laboratories without formal validation as a diagnostic test, which raised an issue of their quality. In this study, more than 46 laboratories participated in EQA over two phases and showed overall good results. Nevertheless, our EQA scheme has some limitations. First, this scheme could not reflect important practical steps, such as sample preparation or nucleic acid extraction, because both in vitro transcribed RNA and extracted RNA were used for EQA. Second, for the first phase, the analytical validation was set by using the participants' own dilution scheme and there was no limitation on repeating the tests to obtain the final results. Therefore, not all laboratories provided results for all of the concentrations analyzed in this study, and some positive results for the lower concentrations could be from various test repeats. This means that the results from this EQA phase may be not suitable for inter-laboratory comparison. Third, the second phase assessment comprised only three samples, including one each of strong positive and weak positive, but did not include diverse concentrations especially on the lower end of the analytical sensitivity of rRT-PCR. Lastly, other coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229E, were not included in the assessment of the analytical specificity of the diagnostic assays.",

Though these kits are for semi-quantitative purposes and a difference in CT values does not correlate with differences in analytical sensitivity, a large difference in the CT values for the same material may influence the analytical sensitivity of the kit. Therefore, cut-off values should be carefully validated for each method in order to have optimal sensitivity for the detection of MERS-CoV in clinical settings. In addition, our study demonstrates that CT values might be different depending on the platform used for performing real-time PCR, even when using the same commercial kit. Therefore, the platform as well as the kit should be considered when establishing or validating the cut-off value of a kit.",
