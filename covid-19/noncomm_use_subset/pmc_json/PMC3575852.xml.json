Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with large genomes [\u223c30 000 nucleotides (nt)] that serve as templates for translation of viral proteins and for replication. The production of proteins from these viral RNAs does not follow the usual rules governing translation. The first polyprotein encoded by open reading frame (ORF)1a, which encodes non-structural proteins, is defined by initiation and termination codons and is translated normally. Signals embedded within the RNA just before the termination codon of ORF1a redirect a fraction of translating ribosomes to bypass the stop codon and continue translation in the -1 reading frame, thus creating the larger ORF1ab polyprotein (1\u20133). These programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) stimulating signals are typically composed of a heptameric slippery site, on which the ribosome can change register by 1 nt in the 5\u2032 direction, followed by a pseudoknot. Slippery site sequence requirements have been characterized for several cell types (4) but the range and diversity of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots continues to grow (5).",

However, we and others have shown that the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -1 PRF signal is composed of three stems [Figure 1A; (1,2,6)]. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the potential to form the third stem is conserved among Group II coronavirus even though the RNA sequences themselves are not well conserved (1). Interestingly, removal of the third stem from the coronavirus frameshift signal still allows for frameshifting (1,2,6,7). Thus, it is not clear what the molecular role of the additional stem\u2013loop (Stem 3\u2013Loop 2 [S3L2]) is, and this requires further study.\n",

We demonstrate the importance of the capping loop sequence in promoting Stem 3 stability and maintaining near\u2013wild-type levels of frameshifting. Specifically, a hexanucleotide, self-complementary sequence in the loop capping Stem 3 raises the possibility that dimerization of the pseudoknot may play a role in viral lifecycle. While the palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3 is not strictly conserved among severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), genomic sequences from Rhinolophus Chinese horseshoe bats (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV) (8) that were previously identified as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV\u2013related CoV (9) also encode the hexanucleotide palindrome.",

Here, the retroviral nucleocapsid proteins can chaperone conversion of the non-covalently linked kissing dimer to a more thermodynamically stable extended duplex-mediated dimer linkage in a structural rearrangement suggested to be associated with viral particle maturation (15). Pioneering work on Infectious Bronchitis Virus suggested that the genomic RNA (gRNA) of CoVs is not packaged as a dimer (16). However, CoV replication is mediated by the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA and also includes a discontinuous step involving synthesis of five to eight nested subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) intermediates (17).",

In the present study, secondary structure analysis by NMR provided further insight into the complex global architecture of the wild-type pk. To establish experimentally whether Stem 3 interacts with the two-stemmed H-type structure, we prepared a transcript lacking the base-paired region of Stem 3 while retaining the hexanucleotide 5\u2032-ACUAGU-3\u2032 palindromic sequence (Figure 1B, \u0394S3 pk) and compared this construct with wild-type pk. The imino NOESY spectrum of the \u0394S3 pk transcript is virtually identical to the wild-type pk native construct with a few marked exceptions. The missing sequential imino assignment path for the mutant \u0394S3 pk is indicated by dashed lines in the superposition of wild-type pk and \u0394S3 pk NOESY spectra shown in Figure 2A. For clarity, these nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities including the characteristic G38-U59 wobble pair are highlighted in the schematic secondary structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot structure (dashed box) and correspond to Stem 3. No significant chemical shift or linewidth changes can be observed for imino protons located outside of Stem 3. The only notable exception is the severely broadened crosspeak for the G14-C25 base-pair in the \u0394S3 pk construct located in the vicinity of the Stem 1\u2013Stem2 junction (Figure 2A, red box). A possible explanation for this observation is that a longer unpaired Loop 3 consisting of 12 (\u0394S3 pk) rather than 3 nt (wild-type pk) may affect the degree of overrotation at the S1\u2013S2 junction. Addressing this question in more detail would require a complete structure determination. At this stage, the large intrinsic linewidth of a 67-nt wild-type pk RNA in combination with severe line-broadening observed for NMR samples concentrated to >200 \u00b5M made this procedure unrealistic (data not shown). However, the overall comparison of exchangeable imino proton spectra of the wild-type pk with \u0394S3 pk suggests that Stem 3 does not noticeably engage in stable tertiary interactions involving the two-stemmed H-type structure and likely constitutes an autonomous substructure within the frameshift signal.\n",

In contrast, a 5\u2032-gaaa-3\u2032 tetraloop containing transcript, S3-gaaa, efficiently prevented dimer formation in vitro (Figure 3A, lane 5).",

Next, we investigated S3L2 self-association as a function of increasing monovalent potassium cation concentration (Figure 4E). We found that S3L2 self-association was predominantly driven by the presence of Mg2+ because significant but slow dimerization resulted from the addition of 6\u2013250 mM KCl in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure 4E, open circles), while responses to varying KCl concentrations were negligible in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ (Figure 4E, closed circles).\n",

We also quantified the concentration dependence of S3L2 dimerization, in the presence of MgCl2, and determined the dissociation constant for the dimer to be 2.6 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5M at 37\u00b0C (Figure 4F).

We thus asked the question whether S3L2 loop\u2013loop kissing complexes (Figure 5B) can potentially form extended duplexes (Figure 5C). Seminal work by Laughrea and Jett\u00e9 have established that loose (loop\u2013loop kissing) dimers are unstable when subjected to native electrophoresis at 25\u00b0C, while tight (extended) duplexes resist these conditions (37,38).

Therefore, we recorded a series of consecutive one-dimensional jump-return echo NMR spectra (Figure 7) to monitor S3L2 imino proton resonances in real-time. The overlapping G43 and U48 as well as G44 and G58 imino proton resonance assignments were confirmed using 2D heteronuclear 1H,15N-HMQC correlations (Supplementary Figure S1).

Figure 7 shows that half of the kissing complex is formed after \u223c9 h and conversion progresses for >20 days before reaching a plateau characterized by a S3L2:(S3L2)2 ratio of 2:8.

The imino assignments through the stem could be easily followed based on the resonance assignments and NOE patterns observed in S3L2 (Supplementary Figure S2). Close inspection of the sequential assignments and NOE patterns revealed the existence of tandem U-U wobble pairs involving the two uridine nucleotides of the tetraloop. In addition, substantial line broadening was observed consistent with extended duplex formation of S3-cuug transcripts (Supplementary Figure S2). Subsequently, we examined the NOESY spectra of the larger, three-stemmed 5\u2032-cuug-3\u2032-tetraloop containing SARS mutants S3-2bp-cuug (Figure 1F) and S3-cuug pk that were subjected to functional frameshifting analysis. We confirmed the formation of the tandem U-U wobble pairs by 2D NOESY. The NOE patterns for the U-U wobbles are an almost perfect subspectrum of the same region of the NOESY for the isolated S3-cuug transcripts (Supplementary Figure S3). Other exchangeable protons in the Stem 1 and Stem 2 regions comprising the H-type pseudoknot overlay with the corresponding imino protons observed in the context of wild-type pk. The excellent agreement in the overlay of the imino connectivities traced by the NOESY experiments indicates that the stable 5\u2032-cuug-3\u2032 tetraloop capping an otherwise wild-type Stem 3 facilitates the formation of extended duplex structures in the context of larger S3-2bp-cuug and S3-cuug pk mutants and locally retains the same structure as S3-cuug in isolation.",

A Loop 2 ACUucc silent (serine codon) mutation was made to investigate the role of the palindrome (S3L2-ACUucc; Figure 1D) in promoting -1 PRF. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequence UCC is present at a similar position in Loop 2 of the transmissible gastroenteritis CoV (1). Dual luciferase measurements of -1 PRF from the S3L2-ACUucc pk construct showed a 63% reduction in frameshift stimulation compared with wild-type pk (5.7% versus 15.0%, Figure 8A). Next, we tested two S3 mutants for frameshift stimulation in the luciferase assay. S3-cuug (Figure 1E), which we showed to readily self-associate (Figure 3A, lane 2), demonstrated a nominal increase in frameshift frequency (17.5%), while a S3 truncation of the same construct (S3-2bp-cuug, Figure 1F) exhibited near wild-type efficiency (15.2%). It is important to note that the previously characterized S3-deletion \u0394S3 pk construct maintained dimerization capability albeit with reduced efficiency (Figures 3B and C, lane 3). Our results are consistent with previous analyses by three different groups that have shown mutations to the third stem of a three-stemmed pseudoknot to have less impact on frameshifting efficiency than mutations to Stem 2 (1,2,6,7). However, our data indicate that silent codon changes to Loop 2 that disrupt the palindrome play a role in regulating the frequency of frameshifting.\n",

The observed effects should therefore reflect changes related to RNA structure within the frameshifting signal, rather than modifying the encoded proteins. To determine the effects on viral growth kinetics, stocks of rescued wild-type SARS-CoV and S3L2-ACUucc pk (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1) were used to infect VeroE6 cells, media was harvested at 0, 5 and 8 h pi and tested by plaque assay. Viral titers for SARS-CoV increased by 2.5 logs at 5 h pi and by 3.5 logs at 8 h pi, while the growth kinetics for S3L2-ACUucc, a mutant that does not form dimers, lagged behind at \u223c1 log increase at 5 h pi and \u223c2.5 logs by 8 h pi (Figure 8B). Our analysis demonstrates that disruption of the palindrome via silent codon changes does impede growth kinetics for S3L2-ACUucc pk at early times pi; however, by 12 h pi, similar titers were detected (data not shown).",

To determine the quantities of sgRNA species, the total RNA was enriched for poly A containing mRNA species (Figure 9C) before separation on agarose gel. All sgRNA species were readily detectible in both SARS-CoV and S3L2-ACUucc samples; however, \u223c1.5-fold reduction in the quantity of sgRNA species was detected at 5 and 8 h pi (Figure 9D), suggesting that reduced levels of RNA transcription also contributed to the titer loss. Finally we compared the levels of ORF1a and ORF1b replicase proteins to determine if these protein levels were altered as well. Equivalent protein concentrations were probed with polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against nsp1 or nsp16 as indicated (Figure 9E and F). Reduced ORF1a and ORF1b replicase protein levels were seen at 5 and 8 h pi but similar levels were detected by 12 h pi (Supplementary Figure S5).

Similarly, in Group 3 coronaviruses the S3L2 region is most likely a single-stranded loop as indicated by a predicted \u0394G of \u22121.8 kcal/mol (1).

Specifically, the Group 1 Human CoV 229 E has been shown to use a kissing stem loop to promote frameshifting rather than a compact H-type pseudoknot (58). Based on sequence alignments, such \u2018elaborated\u2019 pseudoknots could be used by Human CoV NL63, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (6). Similarly, the P1\u2013P2 pseudoknot from the luteovirus barley yellow dwarf virus can be considered a variation on the \u2018elaborated\u2019 CoV pseudoknot structure. It contains a loop L2 of nearly 4 kb, with S2 formed by long-range kissing interactions with nucleotides near the 3\u2032 end of the genome (59). Such a long-distance RNA\u2013RNA kissing interaction is also implicated in -1 PRF of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (60). Thus, an intermolecular dimerization in SARS-CoV may simply represent a variation of the \u2018elaborated\u2019 pseudoknot.",
