Though some small ncRNAs such as microRNAs (4) have been found to be involved in virus-host interactions, the relevance of long ncRNAs to viral infections has not been systematically studied, in part because these ncRNAs have not been easily accessible with typically available technologies. In this study, we performed whole-transcriptome analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected lung samples collected from four mouse strains using deep-sequencing technology. Our results show that there was a widespread differential regulation of long ncRNAs in response to viral infection, suggesting that these ncRNAs are involved in regulating the host response, including innate immunity. At the same time, virus infection models provide a unique platform for studying the biology and regulation of ncRNAs.",

These mice were selected due to their differential range in susceptibility phenotypes following infection with SARS-CoV or influenza virus and the capacity to pursue downstream quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of regulation and function in the Collaborative Cross. Weight loss in the animals was monitored over the course of the infection with SARS MA15 or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 as a measure of disease severity (Fig. 1). We then performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of collected lung tissue samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Directional cDNA libraries were constructed using the not-so-random (NSR) priming method (6), which enabled the profiling of polyadenylated, nonpolyadenylated, coding, and noncoding transcripts, but not small RNAs (6).",

From all samples, we obtained on average over 22 million reads that uniquely mapped to host genomic sites, including many that mapped to nonannotated intergenic regions (Fig. 2a; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). We reasoned that the transcriptional activities detected in nonannotated regions were largely from ncRNAs and that some could be differentially expressed in response to viral infection. To evaluate our approach for the identification of differentially expressed genes, we profiled the same samples using microarrays and compared the profiles with the profiles of the protein-coding part of the NGS data set. We observed a very good correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.73 to 0.8) between two platforms (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), and even better agreement between NGS and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (data not shown).",

Interestingly, we found that most (35 of 37) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions were similarly differentially expressed during influenza virus infection (Fig. 5a).

In that study, we found that SARS-CoV infection resulted in the death of STAT\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice (8). As shown in Fig. 5b, even for the set of 37 ncRNAs examined here, we observed unique patterns of expression changes over time. As expected, most (35 of 37 [95%]) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) during SARS-CoV infection under one or more conditions studied. Interestingly, the response to viral infection also displayed temporal changes, as 35 (95%) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions showed significant changes in expression (P < 0.05) between at least two consecutive time points. Twenty-six (70%) of the ncRNAs and genomic regions were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) among knockout and wild-type mice under one or more conditions during infection.

We therefore infected cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the same strains of mice with the mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34, as SARS-CoV does not infect MEFs. Importantly, we found that about 43% (16 of 37) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in infected MEFs similarly to ncRNAs and genomic regions in lung tissue from infected animals (Fig. 5c). To investigate whether these ncRNAs were also regulated by the interferon response, we treated MEFs separately with beta interferon and found patterns of expression changes that were similar to those observed in influenza virus-infected MEFs. The consistent changes in expression in MEFs in response to both influenza virus infection and interferon treatment convincingly argue that differential regulation of long ncRNAs was neither artifactual nor a result of immune infiltration but instead represents a bona fide host response regulated by innate immunity.",

For each mouse strain, we examined the infection-induced patterns of expression of ncRNAs and their paired neighbor protein-coding genes (see the supplementary material). Interestingly, we found that the changes in expression of neighbor protein-coding genes (fold changes) were significantly associated with the fold changes in expression of the corresponding ncRNAs during infection (P values =1.8e\u221222 to 2.4e\u221232, analysis of variance [ANOVA] F test, Fig. 6a, and the supplementary material). We utilized the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool (11) for functional enrichment analysis on those neighbor protein-coding genes. The most significant functional group identified using DAVID consisted of 11 similar annotation terms related to gene expression (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, previous studies also reported that the genes in neighboring long ncRNAs exhibit a bias toward transcription-related factors (7, 10).

In additional studies using cDNA microarrays, Ahanda et al. identified eight mRNA-like ncRNAs that were differentially expressed in virus-infected birds (13), and Ravasi et al. showed that 70 ncRNAs were dynamically regulated in mouse macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (14). Likewise, Guttman et al., using a custom large intervening ncRNA (lincRNA) array, found that lincRNAs were associated with diverse biological processes across different tissues, including immune surveillance (7).

For example, the differential regulation of some ncRNAs could simply be by-products of global transcriptional profile changes imparted by interferon and/or viral infection, and they may not play a significant role in the context of infection. Alternatively, ncRNAs may represent a whole new class of innate immunity signaling molecules and interferon-dependent regulators, or even a new layer of gene expression regulation responsible for modulating host responses during viral infection. Similarly, ncRNAs may also represent a new potential class of biomarkers for infectious diseases. The similar differential regulation of ncRNAs in response to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infection indicates that a ncRNA-based signature of respiratory virus infection may exist, suggesting additional diagnostic potential. Finally, using viruses to perturb host systems, such as described here, also presents a valuable platform for future studies of ncRNA biology in general. In the future, it is likely that a detailed knowledge of ncRNA regulation and function will be necessary for a full understanding of viral pathogenesis.",

In this study, we infected four of the founder mouse strains used in generating the Collaborative Cross (CC), a newly emerging recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits (15). These strains included 129S1/SvImJ (129/S1), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB) mice, and the animals were provided by Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena or obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). A benefit of using these strains is that it allows for downstream quantitative trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) mapping of the regulation and function of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in pathogenesis and innate immunity in the final panel of 400 CC recombinant inbred mouse lines. Mice were bred at the University of North Carolina (UNC) mouse facility (Chapel Hill, NC). Animal housing, care, and experimental protocols were in accordance with all UNC-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. All animal studies were conducted in animal biosafety level 3 laboratories using Sealsafe HEPA-filtered caging, and personnel wore personal protective equipment, including Tyvek suits and hoods as well as positive-pressure HEPA-filtered air respirators. Ten-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Mice were intranasally infected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone or with 1 \u00d7 105 PFU of SARS recombinant MA15 (rMA15) in 50 \u00b5l of PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or 500 PFU of influenza A virus strain A/Pr/8/34 (H1N1) in 50 \u00b5l of PBS. The mice were weighed once per day and observed twice per day over the course of the infection. For each virus, three to five virus-infected and three mock-infected mice from each strain were euthanized at 2 days postinfection (dpi) with tissues taken for determination of the viral titer and for expression analysis. In this study, one SARS rMA15-infected and one mock-infected mouse from each of the four strains was euthanized at 2 dpi for both the whole-transcriptome analysis using high-throughput sequencing and microarray-based expression profiling.

We then filtered out those loci that overlap with any protein-coding transcripts as annotated or predicted by UCSC or Ensembl to minimize the possibility of the inclusion of protein-coding genes. Obviously, many genuine ncRNAs were excluded from our consideration because of this conservative approach.

We then normalized the raw read counts by the length of the locus and the total uniquely mapped reads for each sample and represented the normalized expression levels similarly as typical RPKMs (reads per kilobase per million reads).

Specifically, we did the following. (i) We fixed a window size (w) and slid it across the genome with a moving step (s). For each window, we computed a score, Sw, as the number of reads aligned within the window, normalized by the total number of uniquely mapped reads for each sample. (ii) To identify differentially expressed windows, we created ratios of scores between the pair of samples and selected those windows passing a threshold (fs) for fold change. (iii) We merged overlapping windows into large intervals if they were differentially expressed in the same direction. (iv) To obtain larger intervals, we joined identified neighboring intervals if there were a low number of reads in between and the larger intervals formed by neighboring ones were also differentially expressed, judged by a threshold fj. (v) To increase the confidence, we then selected only those intervals that were differentially expressed consistently in at least k pairs of samples (here all upregulated or all downregulated in at least 3 out of 4 mouse strains).
