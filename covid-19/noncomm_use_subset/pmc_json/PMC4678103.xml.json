Moreover, a subsequent analysis after adjustment for age, sex, and number of days since onset of symptoms showed no survival benefit of CWB [20].

Patients for whom there is no available compatible plasma are enrolled as concurrent controls, complemented with historical controls.

The design that would provide the best evaluation would be a randomized trial in which one or other intervention would be compared with control patients not receiving the intervention. However, such randomized designs have proved unacceptable in the volatile settings of the current Ebola outbreak, and researchers have at the early stages resorted to nonrandomized study designs [29]. All CP trials were designed to include concurrent control patients. For example, in the Ebola-Tx trial, controls were to be patients presenting when no ABO-compatible plasma was available. However, when the trial started, the supply of CP increased significantly and the number of patients decreased, resulting in sufficient supply of CP to treat nearly all patients. Consequently, it will compare the mortality of treated patients with that of historical controls, with the inherent possibility of biased comparisons. Key concerns in all trials regarded potential confounding factors including variations in patient characteristics, Ebola virulence on presentation, and differences in standards of supportive care over time. For example, the systematic placement of intravenous access lines in patients for CP treatment could encourage more aggressive intravenous hydration during the trial period. How easy it will be to interpret the results of the trials will depend, to a large extent, on the size of the mortality reduction, if any, associated with the intervention.",

This was made possible by the substantial funding made available through international research consortia. As the situation dictated an emergency response, the plasmapheresis material introduced for use in the present trials is unlikely to be an optimal choice for the concerned national transfusion centers. A transition to simpler, nonautomated systems might be indicated. Furthermore, pathogen reduction is an expensive procedure and unlikely to be a priority for resource-constrained settings, where the prerogative is the provision of safe basic blood banking services. The experience of the present trials, which has identified the need to further improve the overall quality of blood banking centers in all 3 countries, should result in longer-term capacity-building projects once the outbreak is contained.",

In many West African countries there is reticence toward blood collection, donation, and transfusion, based on superstitions and beliefs in the community [34, 35]. Experience during the 2014\u20132015 outbreak suggests that if there are appropriate community consultations and discussions, there is a reasonable acceptability among plasma donors, surviving patients, and their family members, at least in the short term. However, a better understanding of plasma donor motivation is required to ascertain whether possible degrees of coercion have occurred. In all 3 high-transmission countries, EVD survivors have organized themselves into survivor associations. Although this has probably substantially eased donor mobilization, more in-depth assessments of their potential role are merited.",

Hence, longer follow-up and more in-depth anthropological assessments among plasma donors and patients are required to further document the acceptability and feasibility of CP as EVD treatment.

With 500 regular donors (approximately 3% of the potential total), a total of 17 500 treatments would potentially be available. Prequalification of donors with high titers of neutralizing antibodies would make the process most efficient.
