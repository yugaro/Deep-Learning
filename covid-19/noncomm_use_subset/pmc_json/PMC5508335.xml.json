Five validated indices of RVSF were measured: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change, lateral tricuspid annular longitudinal peak systolic velocity (S\u2019), and longitudinal global strain (Strain) and strain rate of the RV free wall. Groups were compared using one\u2010way ANOVA and Sidak's test.

Plateletworks\u00ae (PW) consistently detects clopidogrel effect in normal cats using ADP as agonist. In canine PW studies, arachidonic acid (AA) is as useful an agonist as ADP to detect clopidogrel effect, but there are no data for cats. Platelet Function Analyzer\u00ae (PFA) inconsistently detects clopidogrel effect in normal cats using the collagen\u2010ADP cartridge. This also occurs in humans, prompting development of the INNOVANCE\u00ae P2Y cartridge, which consistently detects clopidogrel effect in humans and dogs. The objective of this study was to investigate PW\u2010AA and PFA\u2010P2Y in cats. Nine normal cats and 13 cats with cardiovascular diseases were studied. All had normal hematocrits and platelet counts. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture.

The dogs were evaluated using echocardiography and a catheter for the measurement of their direct blood pressure during PDA occlusion. The diameter of descending aorta was measured using digital fluoroscopic cine loops. After PDA occlusion, the systolic blood pressure did not change; however, pulse pressure significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (DAP) significantly increased (P < 0.01). In a univariate analysis (n = 49), the low postoperative FS% was associated with an older age (P < 0.05), the increased postoperative diastolic blood pressure, and decreased pulse pressure (both with P < 0.01). In a multivariate analysis (n = 49), low postoperative FS% was associated with an older age (P < 0.05) and a decreased postoperative pulse pressure (P < 0.05). The diameter of the descending aorta significantly increased both in systole and diastole (both with P < 0.01) and the aortic FS% was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) just after PDA occlusion. In conclusion, left ventricle might not be able to contract after PDA occlusion because of increased DAP and decreased aortic compliance, i.e., the aortic valve more strongly closed and the aorta was rapidly dilated like a rupturing balloon due to trapping a large amount of blood into aorta.",

In this study, we investigated the autonomic imbalance in dogs with CHF due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) by means of their individual response to that vagal maneuver. Fifty\u2010two client\u2010owned MMVD dogs (stages B1/B2/C/D) and twelve healthy dogs admitted for regular cardiac evaluation were recruited for a prospective observational study. Every dog had an ECG recorded for 5 minutes, and during the last minute both globes were compressed into the orbits using digital pressure until the 5 minute\u2010recording was over. Twenty RR intervals were used to calculate the mean RR interval, the standard deviation of RR intervals, the root mean square of the successive differences in RR intervals and the vasovagal tonus index before eyeball compression and at approximately twenty seconds after compression started. The percent change of every surrogate was calculated. Although a significant difference was only documented for VVTI (P = 0.0419), the other surrogates did behave differently in stages C and D dogs as compared to B1 and B2 animals (Figure 1). An explanation for this might be the parasympathetic withdraw in CHF, in addition to a subtle sympathetic activation due to discomfort, which was likely suppressed in dogs with preserved vagal response. Also, the sustained increased sympathetic activation rather than transitional sympathetic activation might be involved with the distinct response to OCR in symptomatic dogs as compared to the asymptomatic ones.\n\n",

Since dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease are prone to developing ventricular arrhythmias, this study investigated whether indices derived from QT interval could be used to predict an increased likelihood of arrhythmias regardless of clinical signs. 167 client\u2010owned MMVD dogs (stages B1/B2/C) admitted for cardiac evaluation were recruited for a prospective cross\u2010sectional study. Every dog underwent an echocardiogram and ECG recording. Fifty consecutive QT intervals were measured for each dog. QTs were corrected for heart rate and used to calculate the average QT (QTa), QT variance (QTv), total instability (TI), short term (STI) and long term (LTI) instabilities. A significant difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic animals was documented for every parameter (P < 0.0001),with higher values found for stage C dogs. Significant difference between B1 and B2 also existed for QTa. An AUC >0.5 was found when QTa and STI were used to discriminate dogs with or without ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 1). Dogs with QTa >310 (sensitivity:56%/specificity:71%), and STI >11 (sensitivity:56%/specificity:85%) were shown to be slightly (15%) and moderately (30\u201345%) more prone to developing ventricular arrhythmias, respectively. Also, an AUC > 0.5 was documented when every QT index was used to distinguish animals with remodeled (B2/C) and non\u2010remodeled hearts (B1). QTa and QTv best discriminated B1 from B2/C dogs and B1/B2 from C dogs, respectively. Because an increased QT instability was shown in symptomatic patients, QT indices might translate into prognostic surrogates for arrhythmias and CHF in MMVD dogs.\n\n",

However, no significant variations were observed on echocardiographic examination which could indicate signs of cardiac remodeling in both groups. The best performance obtained by the BG based on LVIDs and FS% variables could be explained by catecholamine release since there was no chemical restrain during examination procedure and these animals were more stressed at the examination table. It is believed that, since the animals on BG group were all young adults, with a mean age of 2.5 years, they did not have enough time to manifest all the complications, including cardiovascular and hematological, related to the syndrome. It is our belief that with aging thus, with progression of the condition, right\u2010side cardiac remodeling, and alterations in blood gas and arterial blood pressure would be more evident. Even so, depending on severity, development of pre\u2010capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension may also occur. Our results suggest brachycephalic syndrome may have effects over the cardiovascular system.

            "text": "LASSBio 294 is a compound, developed by the Laboratory of Evaluation and Synthesis of Bioactive Substances (LASSBio\u00ae) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) made from the substrate safrole, a compound extracted from sassafras oil, found in Brazilians plants such as the cinnamon\u2010white (Ocotea pretiosa). The inodilator effect of the compound has been demonstrated in bioassays, using isolated and intact aortic rings, and in whole hearts and fractions of myocardial of rats, suggesting that the mechanism of action for its vasodilatory effects is related to inhibition of phosphodiesterases, and the inotropic effect on the increased Ca 2 +  uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In rats with experimentally induced myocardial infarction, LASSBio 294 decreased collagen deposition, presumably regulating inflammation mediators. In addition, it increased cardiac lusitropism, decreasing left ventricular filling pressure, modulating the action of the SERCA protein, increasing Ca 2 +  uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inducing myocardial relaxation and improving diastolic function. In previous studies performed by these authors on healthy beagle dogs, the oral administration of the compound lowered blood pressure, without causing hypotension or other toxic effects and increased the shortening fraction by 19.1%. Faced with the need to test the compound in a non\u2010rodent mammal with myocardial disease, it was proposed in this study to verify the action of LASSBio 294 (2 mg/kg, n = 7) on the cardiovascular parameters of New Zealand rabbits with dilated cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin, using pimobendan (3 mg/kg, n = 6) as a positive control, both treatments were administered every 12 hours for 30 days. DCM was induced by intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg of doxorubicin, twice a week for three weeks and weekly thereafter until FS = 25% or less was achieved. The animals were evaluated weekly by: electrocardiography, echocardiography, blood pressure measurement, chest X\u2010ray and biomarkers of renal and hepatic function and myocardial injury. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Use of the Federal University of Goias (UFG) under the protocol number 006 / 14. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and compared by means of Tukey test, adopting 5% of significance. Under these conditions, LASSBio 294 increased systolic function, increasing FS by 35% in the second week, and improved diastolic function in a superior manner to pimobendan, maintaining the E /A ratio <1 and E \u2018/ A\u2019 <1 and reducing IVRT, without altering the arterial pressure or producing proarrhythmogenic or toxic effects and also, reduced the serum concentration of creatinine. However, it did not prevent the evolution of the congestive condition, since two animals presented pulmonary edema and effusions. Thus, the pre\u2010clinical in vitro and in vivo testing stages of LASSBio 294 was concluded, and it was tested in rodent and non\u2010rodent mammals, healthy and with induced DCM, with a positive inodilator and lusitropic effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that LASSBio 294 is a promising compound, which needs to be used in clinical trials with individuals with naturally occurring DCM, so that it can complete the necessary trials for its rise as drug, allowing an increase in the existing therapeutic protocols.",

PS has been extensively described in English bulldogs. However, to the best of our knowledge, no specific study has been dedicated to PS in FB. The objective of this prospective observational study was therefore to document the epidemiological, clinical, and echocardiographic features, and risk factors for death in FB with PS. The study population consisted of 66 FB. In most cases (53/66, 80%), at least 2 obstructive lesions were observed (most commonly (42/66, 64%) valvular and supravalvular), using color\u2010flow Doppler mode and 3\u2010dimensional echocardiography. The median Doppler\u2010derived peak transvalvular pulmonary gradient (DG) was high: 170 mmHg (lower\u2010upper quartiles: 139\u2013223 mmHg), with a DG \u2265200 mmHg in 33% of FB. Among the 51 FB for which a follow\u2010up was available, 21/51 (41%) died, 67% (14/21) of all deaths being cardiac\u2010related (CD) at a median age of 3.5 years. In univariate analyses, age (HR=2.2 per 1 year; P = 0.02), clinical signs at presentation (HR=3.7; P = 0.03), DG (HR=1.2 per 10 mmHg; P = 0.01), right ventricle dilation (HR=5.0; P = 0.04), moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (HR=7.6; P < 0.01), and right\u2010sided congestive heart failure (HR=4.8; P = 0.05) were significantly associated with time to CD. After adjustment for age and DG, tricuspid regurgitation remained significantly associated with time to CD (HR=5.1; P = 0.02). In conclusion, PS in FB are commonly severe and complex, with tricuspid regurgitation being an independent predictor of CD.",

Nine dogs presenting with pulmonary edema due to mitral valve insufficiency were treated with a continuous infusion of carperitide (0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min). Dogs with hypotension were excluded from the study. Blood sampling was performed twice: once before the administration of carperitide (Pre) and then after the administration of carperitide (Post). Neurohumoral factors, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), N\u2010terminal pro b\u2010type natriuretic peptide (NT\u2010proBNP), and aldosterone levels, were measured at both time points. In addition, chest radiography, echocardiography, and blood pressure measurements were performed depending on the specific cases. Seven of the 9 dogs showed improvements post\u2010treatment, although 2 cases did not show any improvement. ANP levels increased post\u2010treatment in all cases (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: pre = 292 \u00b1 163 vs. post = 908 \u00b1 866). NT\u2010proBNP levels increased in 4 cases and decreased in 5 cases (pre = 6563 \u00b1 2061 vs. post = 5627 \u00b1 3026). Aldosterone level increased only in one case (pre = 232 \u00b1 172 vs. post = 124 \u00b1 130) In addition, the left atrial aortic root ratio (LA/Ao), E\u2010wave, vertebral heart score (VHS), and blood pressure decreased. Carperitide is a human ANP agent, which is why we expected higher ANP levels post\u2010treatment. We observed a decrease in NT\u2010proBNP levels in all cases that were treated for more than 7 hours. This is thought to be due to a time lag until the half\u2010life period of NT\u2010proBNP and the stretch stimulation of the ventricular muscle, which are reflected in the blood concentration of NT\u2010proBNP. In addition, the ventricular muscle stretch was inhibited by the decrease in left atrial pressure following the administration of carperitide, which lasted for more than 7 hours. Lastly, the decrease in aldosterone levels was thought to be due to the inhibitory effects of carperitide on the renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system. This study suggested that carperitide administration is effective since pulmonary edema is improved and aldosterone is suppressed.",

Eighty dogs were included in a prospective cross\u2010sectional clinical study, grouped according to the staging of CMVD proposed by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (A, B1, B2 and C), based on clinical signs and echocardiographic evaluation. Left atrial volume was calculated using the biplane area\u2010length method from the left apical two and four chamber views at the end of ventricular systole. The LAV was indexed to body weight. LAV/kg showed high values (P25%\u201375%=3.91\u20136.81) compared with groups A (0.82 mL/kg, P25%\u201375%=0.64\u20130.95), B1 (0.91 mL/kg, P25%\u201375%=0.47\u20131.29) and B2 (2.23 mL/kg, P25%\u201375%=1.93\u20132.85). Analysis of ROC curve for CHF diagnosis showed area under curve of 0.92 for LAV/kg. A LAV/kg >3.26 mL/kg was the optimal cut\u2010off identified for detecting CHF in dogs with CMVD with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%. In addition, when LAV is greater than this cut\u2010off, it increases to 90% the probability to detect CHF (an increase of 40% in diagnostic capacity than pre\u2010test), which allows for the decision to treat for CHF. In conclusion, left atrial volume increases with severity of CMVD and helps the detection of CHF in these dogs.",

However, there are no studies determining reference values or evaluating the influence of gender and age on sST2 in healthy dogs. Therefore, this study aimed to measure serum levels of sST2 in healthy dogs, in order to determine normal values for the study population and to evaluate the influence of gender and age on this biomarker concentration for future assessment of dogs with heart disease. With this purpose, a prospective cross\u2010sectional clinical study was conducted, and included a sample of 60 healthy small\u2010to\u2010medium size dogs, males and females, adults of different ages. There was no significant difference in sST2 serum levels between males (22) and females (38) (P = 0.980) or between age groups in the study population (P = 0.358). The reference values found for the serum levels of sST2 in healthy dogs ranged from 36.94 to 44.67 pg/mL (CI 95%), with a mean value of 40.80 pg/mL. There was no influence of gender or age group on serum levels of sST2 for the assessed dog population. It was possible to suggest a reference range for the biomarker in healthy dogs.",

This biomarker has prognostic value in human cardiology, and it is considered an important independent mortality predictor. However, studies assessing sST2 in dogs are still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the utility of sST2, compared to NT\u2010proBNP and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), for assessment of dogs with chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD). With this purpose, 151 dogs in different stages of CMVD were submitted to clinical exam, laboratory tests, cardiologic exams and measurement of sST2, NT\u2010proBNP and cTnI. The results demonstrate that sST2 was higher in dogs in CHF compared to non\u2010CHF dogs. However, when dogs were stratified according to CMVD stages, it was not possible to differentiate the stages based on sST2 concentrations. NT\u2010proBNP and cTnI were higher in CHF dogs, as well as in more advanced stages of CMVD. There was correlation between sST2 and NT\u2010proBNP and cTnI. Analysis of ROC curve for CHF diagnosis showed areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 for sST2, 0.86 for NT\u2010proBNP and 0.76 for cTnI. As for prognosis assessment, sST2 concentrations higher than 40 pg/mL indicated higher mortality compared to groups with lower sST2 values. Results suggest that sST2's performance as a standalone diagnostic test is limited and inferior to the other studied biomarkers. However, sST2 seems to be a useful independent prognostic marker, and mortality predictor in dogs with CMVD.",

The scope of the present study was to evaluate the main diagnoses performed in an 11\u2010year (2005\u20132015) period at the cardiology unit of a teaching hospital. In the period of the study, 11,921 dogs were attended, with gender balance: 51% males and 49% females. Mongrel dogs and Poodles represented both 25% of the animals. The mean age of the patients was 129 months, of which 45% (5,387) sought the unit for pre\u2010anesthetic evaluation. Excluding pre\u2010anesthetic evaluation, CVHD accounted for 64% of the diagnoses, healthy dogs 19%, congenital anomalies 3%, arrhythmias 3%, pericardial effusion 3% (178), being 148 (83%) with cardiac base neoplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy 2%, and 5% left including tracheal collapse, bronchitis, and dirofilariasis. Between 2005 and 2010, 54 animals were diagnosed with cardiac base neoplasia, while between 2010 and 2015, 94 dogs were diagnosed, representing an increment of 74% of cardiac neoplasias. From 141 cases with dilated cardiomyopathy, 97 were attended between 2005 and 2010, and 44 between 2010 and 2015, showing a decrease of 121% in the last period. The data obtained are in agreement with the literature that reveals CVHD and congenital anomalies as the most frequent cardiopathies. The significant decrease in the prevalence of CMD may be caused by despopularization of the breeds predisposed to DCM, while the increase of cardiac base neoplasias may be theorized by the improvement in canine nutritional management increasing survival of companion animals.",

There were no significant differences in electrocardiographic or systolic blood pressure measurements between the groups. The echodopplercardiographic examinations showed a statistically significant difference in speeds in Em waves, between groups at T0 and in the amlodipine group between T0 and T60 and speed of Am wave, between T30 and T60 times. These parameters may indicate a change in early myocardial relaxation. This is the first prospective randomized double blinded study comparing pimobendan and amlodipine in stage C CMVD dogs.

Agitation of the animals in each situation was also considered, in order to correlate it to different evaluators and anatomical cuff positions. For this purpose, 36 dogs, males and females, up to 20 kg were used. Each patient had their SBP measured by Doppler method by three evaluators, both on the left forelimb as the tail, in randomly selected order. Each evaluator classified the animal as calm or agitated. The results showed no difference in SBP measured between forelimb (136.8 \u00b1 26.37, P = 0.3549) and tail (133.2 \u00b1 25.64, P = 0.3062), with concordance between the anatomical positions. Measures obtained between evaluators with different degrees of experience did not differ (Forelimb: evaluator A: 136.9 \u00b1 31.52, P = 0.3928; evaluator B: 134.8 \u00b1 24.44, P = 0.1257; evaluator C: 138.8 \u00b1 31.14, P = 0.1322. Tail: evaluator A: 132.9 \u00b1 28.33, P = 0.5157; evaluator B: 127.2 \u00b1 24.50, P = 0.4182; evaluator C: 132.4 \u00b1 21.09, P = 0.6715). Agitation of patients did not change between the anatomical positions and evaluators. SBP values and agitation decreased as the dogs get used to the measurements in forelimb. It was concluded that the measurement of SBP by Doppler method can be performed reliably in both forelimb and tail, and adequate instruction is enough to examiners measured precisely SBP.",

Ultrafiltration (UF) has major advantages such as reducing the amount of blood transfusion and removal of various cytokines in human medicine. We performed MVP for dogs with spontaneous mitral valve regurgitation(MR) under CPB and investigated the effect of ultrafiltration. Twenty\u2010two dogs diagnosed with severe MR that underwent MVP under CPB were included. Depending on whether or not ultrafiltration was used, it was divided into a non\u2010UF group and a UF group. We performed CUF (Conventional Ultrafiltration) and MUF (Modified Ultrafiltration). The lowest hematocrit (Ht) value and Ht after the end of CPB in both groups were compared. The average of the lowest Ht during the operation was 23.0% in the non\u2010UF (n = 11) group and 24.0% in the UF group (n = 11), and no significant difference was observed between the two groups. The average Ht after the end of the CPB was 29.0% in the non\u2010UF group and 35.5% in the UF group. Thus the average Ht was significantly higher in the UF group (P = 0.01). We also analyzed cases with low body weight (5 kg or less) separately. There were 6 such cases in the non\u2010UF group and 9 low body weight cases in the UF group. The lowest Ht and the Ht after the end of the CPB was significantly higher in the UF group. Notably, the average Ht after the CPB was 10% higher in UF group (36.0%) than in non\u2010UF group (26.0%).The amount of cardioplegia sufficient to produce cardiac arrest varies depending on the specific case. This often results in excessive hemodilution. Since it helps to drain excess fluids under such circumstances, CUF is thought to contribute to the difference in Ht in this study. In addition, during MUF, residual blood in the extracorporeal circuit can be returned to the patient's body. As a result, the Ht after the end of the CPB were higher in the UF group than in the non\u2010UF group. We conclude that UF during CPB increases the lowest Ht value during CPB and increases Ht after end of the CPB in dogs undergoing MVP. These difference are particularly noticeable in small dogs.",

RCM diagnosis was based on the following echocardiographic criteria: left atrial (LA) or biatrial enlargement associated with normal or mildly altered left ventricle (LV). Cats with mildly altered LV should also have a restrictive LV filling pattern. Median survival time to CD and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Kaplan\u2010Meier method and multivariable Cox models, respectively. The study population consisted of 92 cats with RCM. Most RCM cats (64/92, 70%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, with dyspnea related to congestive heart failure in 57/64 cats (89%). Fifty\u2010eight of the 72 RCM cats for which follow\u2010up was available died (81%). CD represented 64% of all death causes, with a median survival time from diagnosis to CD of 667 days. Independently of age, biatrial enlargement and arrhythmia, the risk of CD was increased by both the LA on aorta (Ao) ratio and the presence of severe LA enlargement (LA:Ao ratio \u22652): HR=4.2 for a 1\u2010unit increase, 95% confidence interval (CI)=[1.7\u201310.7] (P = 0.002) and HR=2.5, 95% CI=[1.1\u20135.6] (P = 0.003), respectively.

This study aimed to establish reference intervals for Gal\u20103 in a healthy dog population and to evaluate the influence of gender and age on this biomarker concentration. A prospective cross sectional clinical study was conducted, and included a sample of 60 healthy small\u2010to\u2010medium size dogs, males and females, adults of different ages.

This study aimed to establish the utility of this new biomarker, isolated or in association with Type B natriuretic pro\u2010peptide (NT\u2010proBNP) and cardiac troponin I to estimate short term prognosis in dogs with HF caused by CMVD. It was designed as a prospective cross\u2010sectional clinical study with a longitudinal arm. One hundred thirty nine dogs were distributed among five groups with rigorous selection criteria, according to ACVIM CMVD staging (Control group: stage A\u2010 60 healthy small breed dogs, predisposed to CMVD; 28 dogs in stage B1, 20 dogs in stage B2, 20 dogs in stage C and 11 dogs in stage D), recruited from a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Groups B1, B2, C and D had a second blood sampling at day 60. Measurements were obtained for human Gal\u20103, NT\u2010proBNP and cTnI. Reference values obtained for group A for human Gal\u20103 were 7.548 ng/mL (P25%\u201375% = 8.933\u201310.960). We concluded that the magnitude and variation observed in Gal\u20103 did not allow for detection of differences between stages of CMVD nor were capable of identifying patients in HF, compared to the other measured biomarkers, NT\u2010proBNP and cTnI, already established for canine HF evaluation.",

Longitudinal Strain (LSt) and Tissue Motion Annular Displacement (TMAD) are techniques that evaluate these fibers. TMAD, which has not been investigated in dogs, is calculated as the dislodgement of a virtual point automatically determined between mitral's septal and lateral annulus toward the left ventricular apex. One of the reported advantages of TMAD over LSt is the possibility of having it calculated using images not suitable for strain analysis, as well as the reduced processing time. In this prospective cross\u2010sectional observational study twenty\u2010seven healthy dogs (1\u201314 years/2\u201332 kg) underwent an echocardiogram. Apical 4\u2010chamber (AP4) and 2\u2010chamber (AP2) images were obtained, which allowed the calculation of TMAD and LSt obtained from both images. Data underwent the Shapiro\u2010Wilk test to check for a normal distribution. Results are shown in table 1. Similar TMAD and LSt was calculated from AP4 and AP2 images. No differences existed between males and females for TMAD\u2010AP4, TMAD\u2010AP2 and LSt. A positive correlation existed between TMAD\u2010AP2 and LSt\u2010AP2, Global LSt (combined AP4 + AP2 LSt) and body weight. Interestingly, TMAD correlated significantly with echocardiographic surrogates of volume and LV filling pressure, but LSt did not. In addition to being technically easier to perform, TMAD required less image enhancement and operator experience as compared to LSt. Further studies are warranted to clarify whether TMAD might be a reliable substitute for global LSt in the assessment of longitudinal systolic function in dogs.\n\n",

            "text": "This study was performed to identify the mutation causing a progressive neurodegenerative disease in Shiba Inu dogs with storage body autofluorescence. Two related Shiba Inu dogs were suspected to have neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) based on clinical signs, antemortem diagnostics, disease progression and autofluorescence of storage material on histopathology. A whole genome sequence (WGS) was generated with DNA from one affected dog using previously described techniques. The data were screened for potentially causal mutations in known NCL genes but no candidate variants were found. However, the WGS contained a novel homozygous deletion of a conserved codon in the HEXB gene (which encodes the beta subunit of beta\u2010hexosaminidase). The deletion was not found in the WGS from 105 unaffected dogs of various breeds. The other affected Shiba Inu was also homozygous for this variant. Mutations in HEXB have been implicated in GM2 gangliosidosis (Sandhoff disease) in humans and in other dog breeds. Beta\u2010hexosaminidase activity was measured in brain tissue from one of the affected dogs using previously described synthetic substrates. Activity against two different substrates was markedly reduced compared to a normal dog, consistent with Sandhoff\u2010like disease (HEXB deficiency). Thus, we conclude that the HEXB mutation in these dogs caused GM2 gangliosidosis and led to their clinical signs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that GM2 gangliosidosis\u2010associated storage material is autofluorescent. This study also demonstrates the utility of WGS for the efficient diagnosis of potentially heritable diseases in veterinary medicine by identifying a mutation that abolishes HEXB activity in Shiba Inu dogs.",

A population pharmacokinetic approach and non\u2010linear mixed effects modeling (NLME) was used to examine the variation and source of variation in our population. Eighteen client\u2010owned dogs on maintenance therapy with LEV\u2010XR only (Group L, n = 6), LEV\u2010XR and phenobarbital (Group LP, n = 6) or LEV\u2010XR and zonisamide (Group LZ, n = 6) were enrolled. All drugs were examined at steady state concentrations. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the morning dose of LEV\u2010XR was administered with food. The LP group had significantly lower CMAX compared to the L and LZ groups (13.48 \u00b1 9.48 vs. 33.93 \u00b1 29.84 and 34.13 \u00b1 9.01 \u03bcg/mL, respectively), significantly lower AUC (134.15 \u00b1 153.67 vs. 353.10 \u00b1 284.11 and 452.80 \u00b1 116.89 h\u2219\u03bcg/mL, respectively), and significantly higher CL/F (0.17 \u00b1 0.20 vs. 0.08 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 L/kg/hours, respectively), demonstrating that concurrent administration of phenobarbital significantly lowers the LEV concentration in epileptic dogs.

To address the effects of miR\u201034a on OSA cell behavior, the canine OSA8 and Abrams cell lines which express low basal levels of miR\u201034a were transduced with miR\u201034a lentiviral constructs resulting in high levels of miR\u201034a. In transformed canine OSA8 and Abrams cell lines, miR\u201034a overexpression reduced cellular invasion and migration but had no effect on cell proliferation or cell cycling. Transcriptional profiling of OSA8 cells overexpressing miR\u201034a demonstrated dysregulation of several genes, including down\u2010regulation of putative miR\u201034a target genes associated with cellular invasion. Consistent with these findings, enhanced expression of these genes correlates with decreased miR\u201034a expression in primary canine OSA tumors.",

The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology and Small Animal Internal Medicine listservs were used to solicit data pertaining to cases in which toceranib was used to treat canine GIST. Case data from 28 dogs with histopathogically confirmed GIST were received from 17 participating institutions. Dogs undergoing treatment other than surgical excision prior to toceranib were excluded. Clinical benefit (CB) was observed in 93% (26/28; 24 complete response [CR]/no evidence of disease [NED], 1 partial response [PR], 1 stable disease [SD]). All dogs with microscopic disease experienced CB (21/21; 21 NED), while 71% (5/7; 3 CR, 1 PR, 1 SD) with gross disease experienced CB. Median duration of treatment in dogs experiencing CB was 36 weeks (1\u2013159). At the time of data submission, 8/26 responding dogs were still receiving treatment and an additional 4/26 were experiencing continued NED following completion of prescribed therapy.

Unlike the other anatomical forms of lymphoma, cutaneous lymphomas have a low response to the treatment, and dogs with nonepitheliotropic lymphoma have a lower survival time when compared to dogs with epitheliotropic form. The resistance of neoplastic cells to cytotoxic drugs is the major cause of failure of chemotherapy in cancer and one of multiple drug resistance mechanisms (MDR) is the active drug efflux mediated by ATP\u2010Binding Cassette superfamily (ABC). Among these transporters is P\u2010glycoprotein (ABCB1).The aim of this study was to investigate ABCB1 immunoexpression in cutaneous epitheliotropic and non\u2010epitheliotropic lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 18 paraffin\u2010embedded tumor samples of cutaneous lymphoma in dogs (11 nonepitheliotropic and 7 epitheliotropic) using CD20 and CD3 markers for immunophenotyping and ABCB1 antibody (C494 \u2013 Enzo Life Sciences\u00ae). It was found 5 epitheliotropic T\u2010cells and 2 B\u2010cells and 10 nonepitheliotropic T\u2010cells and 1 B\u2010cell lymphoma. Two samples of epitheliotropic lymphoma were negative for ABCB1 and the median percentage of labeled cells was 20% (0\u201340%) whereas in nonepitheliotropic lymphoma, all cases were positive for ABCB1 and the median percentage of labeled cells was 50% (20\u201390%) and statistical analysis showed a significant difference expression of this marker (P = 0.0162). In conclusion, the majority of cases with cutaneous lymphoma expressed P\u2010glycoprotein and the subtype nonepitheliotropic showed higher labeled cells than epitheliotropic.",

Forty\u2010seven samples of cats with intestinal lymphoma were studied and immunohistochemical was performed for: CD3, PAX5 and Ki\u201067. The analysis of Ki\u201067 was made by counting 1,000 infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment and mitotic index was ranked as mild, moderate or high, by the evaluation of 10 microscopic fields at 40\u00d7. The results showed a significant difference in the immunohistochemical expression of Ki\u201067 in B and T\u2010cell Lymphoma (P = 0.001) with a median of 47.2% and 8.5%, respectively. The same was observed when comparing the histological type (lymphoblastic and lymphocytic), with a median of 40.5% and 8.2%, respectively (P = 0.002).

Specifically, this study focused on determining radioiodine dose by measuring thyroid gland size and percent of 99mTcO4\u2010 uptake using thyroid scintigraphy. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in all cats by finding a serum T4 concentration above the reference interval and characteristics diagnostic of hyperthyroidism on nuclear scintigraphy. Scintigraphy was performed by obtaining images 30 minutes after IV administration of 3.0 mCi 99mTcO4. In cats in the novel dose group, percent dose uptake was calculated by drawing a region of interest around the thyroid gland lobe(s) and dividing the corrected counts (CPM) in the thyroid gland by the 99mTcO4 dose (CPM). Cats with a percent dose uptake < 5%, 5\u201310%, and > 10% were calculated to receive 3 mCi, 3.5 mCi, or 4.5 mCi of 131I, respectively administered subcutaneously. Thyroid size was assessed by a ratio of the thyroid ROI size (# of pixels) to the salivary ROI size (# of pixels) (TS). Cats with a TS ratio of <5, 5\u201310, and >10 were calculated to receive 3 mCi, 3.5 mCi, and 4.5 mCi of 131I. The dose of 131I to be given was first determined by measuring percent dose uptake. If the thyroid size fell into a higher dosing category than percent uptake, the dose was increased accordingly. Cats in the fixed dose group received a mean of 4.3 mCi of 131I subcutaneously. Cats were evaluated 6 months after treatment to determine the functional status of the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism was defined as having a serum T4 concentration below the reference interval and persistent hyperthyroidism was defined as having a serum T4 concentration above the reference interval 6 months post treatment. Fifty\u2010eight cats were included in the novel dose group and the fixed dose group consisted of 25 cats treated prior to those in the novel dose group. Univariate analysis using Chi\u2010square and Fisher's exact analysis was used to determine associations between dose determination method and outcome with the level of significance set at P < 0 .05.",

However, there is controversy about which of the adipose tissues contributes more to these complications in the canine species. The present study aimed to evaluate the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of ten obese female dogs and ten female dogs with eutrophic body condition, regarding adipocyte size and presence of leukocyte infiltration. The study was conducted with routine animals from the Veterinary Hospital, and all of the animals were submitted to a complete clinical examination, classification based on the body condition score and blood exams to exclude concomitant diseases. Fragments of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were obtained during electives ovariosalpingohisterectomy procedures, the samples were stained with Hematoxylin\u2010Eosin and analyzed with Zeiss Microscope software. It was observed that obese dogs presented remarkably larger adipocyte size when compared to animals with ideal body condition, in a significance level of 5% through Student's T\u2010test. Likewise, it was noted the presence of significantly higher leukocyte infiltrate in obese animals, in a significance level of 5% in the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test, compared to animals with normal body condition that did not have leukocyte infiltration detected. However, the size of adipocytes and leukocyte infiltrate in obese animals did not differ significantly between the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. It was concluded, therefore, that obesity in dogs is related with the increase of adipocytes and with presence of leukocyte infiltration, but it was not possible to state in this study that different fat deposits have differentiated metabolic and endocrine levels, which could interfere in a specific way in the inherent processes in obese and diabetic patients.\n",

Objective of the present study is to evaluate oxidative stress by measuring the TBARS present in samples of obese dogs before and after the weight loss program. The work was carried out with routine animals of the Veterinary Hospital of the Pontifical Catholic University of Parana (located in Parana, Brazil). The animals were submitted to a complete clinical examination, blood count, biochemistry, urinalysis and systolic blood pressure measurement. Subsequently, they were classified as obese on the body scale; body mass index and percentage of body fat. The animals were divided into group 1 (pre\u2010diet) and group 2 (post\u2010diet). Ten obese animals were selected and submitted to a hypocaloric diet loss program. TBARS was performed using the Elisa technique. All animals in groups 1 and 2 presented TBARS values above the reference value, and there was a statistically significant reduction of the values from group 1 to group 2 (P = 0.034). Based on the results, it was concluded that obese dogs present higher production of lipid peroxidation than animals with ideal body scale, leading to the development of oxidative stress and elevation of TBARS concentrations.",

Thyroid function was evaluated through total thyroxine (T4T) measurements. A total of 212 cat serum samples were sent to a private laboratory, where T4T was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Of the 212 assessed serum samples, 3.30% confirmed feline hyperthyroidism, 59.91% were within the normal range and 36.79% were below the normal value, suggesting sick euthyroid syndrome. In 2.35% of the samples, T4T values were close to the upper limit value, which raises the possibility that these cats had FHT, but whose comorbidities at the time of blood collection reduced T4T values in blood serum.

HT (tonicity > 315 mOsm/L) occurred more frequently in DD (45.9% vs 31.1% for NDD). The dMCV, a marker for HT, was significantly increased in DD (3.9 vs 1.7 fL for NDD).

The results show that stable, insulin\u2010treated diabetic dogs frequently have HT and that GLU is the major osmole that contributes to HT in DD. An increase in dMCV is a modest predictor for serum fructosamine, suggesting the latter is an indirect marker for hypertonicity in DD.

Among the various presentations of ACTH available for testing, the Depot Tetracosactide (Synacthen\u00ae Depot) is economically advantageous in some countries, because of the volume and concentration of its ampoule (1.0 mg/1.0 mL). This advantage depends on the reuse of the surplus volume of the ampoule, as the indicated dose for dogs is 0.25 mL per dog. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of freezing on the biological activity of Depot Tetracosactide for the stimulation of adrenal gland in healthy dogs. Thirteen healthy adult dogs were submitted to ACTH stimulation test (0.25 mL/dog/IM) four times at intervals of two months between each test (0, 2, 4 and 6 months). The first stimulation test was done in every dog with the first aliquot of a fresh, refrigerated ampoule, opened at the time of application. The remaining three aliquots were stored at \u221220\u00b0C in plastic syringes of 50 units protected from light. Samples for determination of serum cortisol by radioimmunoassay were obtained before, one and two hours after administration of the ACTH. All samples were thawed once and analyzed in duplicate by ANOVA. Serum cortisol levels did not differ significantly (P < 0.01) before or after freezing for all sampling times. We conclude that Depot Tetracosactide can be stored in plastic syringes at \u221220\u00b0C for up to six months without interfering with the biological stability of the hormone.",

Host responses to microbial dysbiosis were studied using immunohistochemistry to identify cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa expressing intestinal NF\u2010kB (p65) and CD11b+. Results indicated that most IBD/LSA cats were middle aged or older having chronic gastrointestinal signs of several months duration. Analysis by FISH showed that mucosal bacteria (EUB) were uncommonly observed in the duodenum of diseased cats. The numbers of mucosal Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. were increased (P < 0.05) in IBD cats as compared to cats with LSA. Conversely, total numbers of Fusobacterium spp. were increased (P < 0.05) in colonic tissues of cats with LSA vs. IBD (LSA: median 30 [range 0\u2013378]; IBD: median 9 [range 0\u2013346]). Moreover, the numbers of Fusobacterium spp. found within adherent mucus of colons in cats with LSA were increased (P \u2264 0.05) relative to other mucosal compartments. Mucosal cells expressing NF\u2010kB and CD11b+ were increased (P < 0.05) in intestines of cats with LSA vs. IBD suggesting the presence of a pro\u2010inflammatory microenvironment. In conclusion, alterations exist in the composition of the mucosal microbiota in cats with LSA and IBD. The intestine of cats with LSA is selectively enriched with bacterial species, including Fusobacterium spp. These microbiota may trigger recruitment of tumor\u2010infiltrating immune (CD11b+) cells contributing to a pro\u2010inflammatory environment that is conducive for intestinal LSA progression.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate duodenal levels of IL\u20101\u03b2 protein in a larger number of dogs with different clinical severity of IBD. Duodenal biopsies from ten dogs each with mild IBD (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index, CCECAI 0\u20135), moderate IBD (CCECAI 6\u20138), severe IBD (CCECAI \u22659) and dogs with protein\u2010losing enteropathy (PLE), as well as 10 healthy Beagle dogs were included in the study. Biopsy samples were weighed prior to manipulation. Samples were homogenized at 20 Hz for 2 minutes in 500 \u03bcL homogenization buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween\u201020) with protease inhibitor cocktail. Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 12500 RCF for 2 minutes and the supernatants frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until the day of ELISA. Quantification of IL\u20101\u03b2 protein expression was determined using a commercially available canine\u2010specific IL\u20101\u03b2 ELISA (Kingfisher Biotech Inc) following the manufacturer's assay instructions. All samples were analysed in duplicate. Median IL\u20101\u03b2 expression (pg/ml/mg tissue) was 121.6 (range 38.3\u2013219.4) in the severe IBD group; 19.7 (range 10.9\u201324.8) in the moderate severity IBD group; 13.3 (range 8.0\u201329.8) in the mild severity IBD group, 13.0 (range 8.0\u201327.9) in the PLE group, and 0.9 (range 0.3\u20131.4) in the healthy control dogs.

ALICAM is a capsule endoscopy system that images the entire bowel. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the frequency of jejunal lesions in dogs given ALICAM for gastrointestinal signs and/or laboratory abnormalities. A board\u2010certified internist interpreted each study. Eight of 131 (6.1%) dogs had complete studies with lesions identified in the jejunum that were considered significant. Of the eight dogs with positive studies, 6 were given ALICAM for a regenerative anemia, while 2 had signs of overt gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). Five of 8 dogs had a normal gastrointestinal tract on ultrasound prior to ALICAM administration. One dog had a normal gastroduodenoscopy and a second dog had a normal gastroduodenoscopy and laparoscopy prior to ALICAM. ALICAM findings included ulcerated masses in 2/8 dogs, large erosions or ulcers in 4/8 dogs, and focal fluid, blood or mucosal abnormalities in 2/8 dogs. Following ALICAM, two dogs underwent manual push enteroscopy. In one case, the ulcerative lesions seen on ALICAM were not found. In the second case, the suspected lesion was identified and resected. A third dog had an exploratory laparotomy with subsequent identification and resection of the mass seen with ALICAM. ALICAM is useful in imaging the jejunum and should be considered an important diagnostic step in the work up of gastrointestinal disease, especially in cases of unexplained anemia where traditional endoscopy or ultrasound failed to identify a cause.",

Since, according to the manufacturer, only traces of IF should be present in the PEz, this finding suggests that dogs, as has been demonstrated in humans, may have an IF\u2010independent pathway for CBL absorption.

Recent publications suggest that oxidative stress could also represent a significant factor in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs. The objective of this study was to compare a panel of various serum biomarkers evaluating both the antioxidant response and the oxidative damage in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy control dogs. Eighteen dogs with IBD and 20 healthy dogs were enrolled in the study. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing ability of the plasma (FRAP), total thiol concentrations, and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity were evaluated in serum to determine antioxidant response. To evaluate oxidative status, ferrous oxidation\u2010xylenol orange (FOX), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species production (ROS) concentrations in serum were determined. Mean concentrations of all antioxidant biomarkers analyzed, with exception of FRAP, were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in serum of dogs with IBD than healthy dogs.

In humans, increased expression of membrane\u2010bound CD25 has been reported in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, during transplant rejection, and some types of neoplasia. A soluble form of CD25 (sCD25) is generated by proteolytic cleavage and has a molecular mass of 45 kDa. Elevated serum concentrations of sCD25 have been reported in human patients with the aforementioned conditions. A positive correlation has been reported between the membrane expression of CD25 and the serum concentration of sCD25. In vitro, activated T cells and Tregs have been shown to shed sCD25, therefore high concentrations of serum sCD25 are thought to be reflective of a sustained immune activation. Moreover, sCD25 has been used as a biomarker to help characterize disease progression, prognosis, and treatment in humans.

Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood or saliva samples of 96 cases and 98 controls. Genotyping of cases and controls was performed on the Canine Illumina HD SNP array and data generated were analyzed using PLINK. Using Fst and logistic association analyses, we identified 16 candidate genes that have been previously reported to be associated with human IBD or are involved in the pathways that are linked to the disease. Eight of these genes, one (PTPRC; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type C) on chromosome 7 and seven (IL4, IL5, IL13, CSF2; Colony Stimulating Factor 2, SLC22A4 and A5; Solute Carrier Family22 member 4 and 5, IRF1; Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) on chromosome 11 have been identified in both approaches. In conclusion we identified 16 genes associated with IBD in GSDs. Our results suggest that Th2 cytokines could be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD in GSDs. Targeted re\u2010sequencing of the genes identified in our study will help to identify causative SNPs and consequently functional analysis of the causal SNPs reveal insights into mechanisms involved in pathogenesis on canine IBD.",

The gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small intestine [SI], and colon) was normal (n = 8) or characterized by nonspecific wall thickening (n = 7). Seventeen of 17 CE studies were abnormal. Findings consisted of irregular/thickened mucosa with or without erosions (n = 6), numerous dilated lacteals (n = 4), severe erosions or ulcers with active bleeding (n = 2), mass (n = 2), hookworms (n = 1), SI nodules (n = 1), and lesions consistent with colonic vascular ectasia (n = 1). Lesions seen on CE (dilated lacteals, colonic vascular ectasia) were confirmed in two dogs that subsequently underwent traditional endoscopy. A third dog had gastroduodenoscopy prior to CE, which showed SI hemorrhage, but missed the SI nodules later identified with CE. A diagnosis of Strongyloides was made based on endoscopic biopsies and fecal Baermann test. A fourth dog with severe melena had a negative gastroduodenoscopy and laparoscopy, yet CE subsequently identified severe gastrointestinal erosions and ulcers thought to be secondary to NSAID administration.

We therefore investigated the effects of several pre\u2010conditioning methods and donor sex on in vitro cytokine production of adipose\u2010derived canine MSC (cMSC). Passage 6 cMSC were generated from cryopreserved subcutaneous adipose tissue from 6 healthy, adult, intact dogs, 3 female and 3 male. cMSC were subjected to 6 different conditions: control, poly I:C, IFN\u03b3, TGF\u03b2, serum\u2010free media, and a mixed hypoxic environment. Supernatants from the cMSC were harvested after 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. Levels of IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201010, TGF\u03b2, VEGF, and MCP\u20101 were determined by ELISA. IL\u201010 was below the level of detection in all samples. TGF\u03b2 was measured in the wells that were treated with TGF\u03b2 but was generally otherwise undetectable. IL\u20106 was only detected in relatively low levels in some samples from one male and one female donor. cMSC produced small to moderate amounts of IL\u20108 constitutively, which reached peak levels by 18 hours and was altered by pre\u2010conditioning. cMSC produced large amounts of MCP\u20101 and VEGF, which were altered by pre\u2010conditioning. Generally, the serum\u2010free and the mixed hypoxic environment decreased production of all measured cytokines. Samples from the male donors showed significant donor variability compared to females suggesting that treatment success might be influenced by careful donor selection as well as pre\u2010treatment conditioning, depending on the desired outcome.",

It has been recommended for use in dogs to control hemorrhage such as epistaxis or with splenic hemangiosarcoma. However there have been no studies evaluating the safety of Yunnan Baiyao for use in dogs and there have been no in vivo studies on the effect of Yunnan baiyao on coagulation parameters in healthy dogs. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of Yunnan Baiyao on the kinetics of hemostasis and to determine if there are any adverse effects associated with the administration of Yunnan Baiyao to healthy dogs. This study used six healthy purpose bred dogs. Baseline evaluation included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and hemostatic kinetics using ROTEM thromboelastrometry (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM). ROTEM parameters assessed included clotting time, clot formation, clot stability and clot lysis. The dogs were administered oral Yunnan baiyao at a dose of 25 mg/kg orally once daily for 6 days. On day 2, day 4 and day 6 ROTEM thromboelastometry was again performed on all dogs. On day 6 a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time was also performed on each dog. No significant changes were noted with treatment in any of the parameters monitored. No significant change in clotting times (P > 0.2), clot formation time (P > 0.2), and clot formation rate (P > 0.2) were noted when pre\u2010treatment ROTEM values and post treatment ROTEM values were compared. From the results of this study we can conclude that Yunnan Baiyao is safe for administration to dogs and does not result in significant changes to baseline health parameters or coagulation parameters in healthy dogs.",

DMSO is the standard solvent used for biotin, since biotin is insoluble in aqueous solutions. Biotin precipitates in DMSO solutions of 50% or less, and high DMSO concentrations are therefore needed for biotin labeling studies. Inadvertent dilution of DMSO in residual plasma during RBC labeling therefore has the potential to render biotinylation ineffective. Additionally, we found that different concentrations of DMSO cause variable lysis of RBCs: 60% DMSO (diluted in PBS) caused marked hemolysis, 50 and 100% caused moderate hemolysis, 30, 40 and 90% caused mild hemolysis, and 10, 20, 70 and 80% caused no hemolysis. Our findings suggest that transfusion studies using biotinylated RBCs may be susceptible to technique artifacts, with subtle variations in DMSO concentrations leading to either failure of biotinylation or inadvertent RBC damage.\n",

Oxidative damage occurs in stored human erythrocytes as evidenced by decreased glutathione concentrations, but this has yet to be investigated in cats. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of storage on glutathione, osmotic fragility, and methemoglobin reductase activity in feline pRBCs. Whole blood (60 mL) was collected from five healthy cats into blood bags containing CPDA\u20101. Each bag was split in half and pRBC units were prepared. For each cat, additive solution 3 (AS\u20103) was added to one of the units and pRBCs were stored at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots of each unit were sampled on days 1, 14, 28, 35, and 42 of storage and assayed for glutathione, osmotic fragility, and methemoglobin reductase activity. Friedman's test was used to assess changes over time. Glutathione decreased significantly with time in both AS\u20103\u2010treated and untreated pRBCs. Osmotic fragility increased significantly with time in untreated pRBCs, but did not change from baseline in pRBCs treated with AS\u20103. Methemoglobin reductase activity was unchanged in both treated and untreated samples. Storage of feline pRBCs over 42 days leads to glutathione depletion and increased osmotic fragility. These findings are further evidence for storage lesion in feline pRBCs. However, the addition of AS\u20103 mitigates the some of these changes and should be considered in the development of future blood product protocols.",

This variable response to treatment may be due to alterations in the cytochrome P450 gene coding for enzymes responsive for clopidogrel metabolism, as several polymorphisms have been identified in humans. This is the first study to investigate the effect of the generic formulation of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation, but due to the low sample size, meaningful conclusions cannot be made about the varying response to the drug.

A retrospective descriptive observational study was performed involving 66 dogs at 2 veterinary teaching hospitals: Colorado State University (57) and Oregon State University (9). Medical records databases were searched for cases meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria for primary IMHA. Owners and referring veterinarians of identified dogs were contacted with a survey via postal mail to gather information regarding vaccination of the dog following diagnosis. Referring veterinarians were contacted by phone regarding vaccination history for each dog prior to diagnosis of IMHA. At least one survey was returned in 44 cases. Results indicated 22 dogs did not receive vaccinations after diagnosis, and 21 dogs did receive vaccinations after diagnosis. For the remainder of dogs, no survey was returned or the survey was excluded for inconsistency of information. Of the vaccinated dogs, only 2 possible vaccination reactions were reported (vomiting and urticaria in 1 dog, and worsening anemia in 1 dog). A date of vaccination prior to diagnosis was available for 46 dogs. The mean number of days between vaccination and initial diagnosis of IMHA was 351 days. These results indicate that vaccination occurred among nearly half of dogs diagnosed with IMHA, with rabies being the most common vaccine administered (19 of 21 dogs). This may reflect the legal requirement of rabies vaccination in most locations. Adverse events were uncommon overall, but comparison to the rate of adverse events in the general population was not performed. Finally, this study did not document a temporal relationship between vaccination and initial diagnosis of IMHA, although comparison to a control population is necessary to confirm this finding.",

In the results, the value of alpha showed a tendency to increase as the grade increased (table 1, P = 0.03), which indicates higher level of fibrinogen activation in more advanced grades. In the rank coefficient correlation between conventional coagulation tests and TEG, platelet had a significantly positive coefficient correlation with MA and G value in heartworm infected grade 1. An interesting result is that a dog diagnosed femoral arterial thromboembolism showed significantly hypercoagulable state in TEG, compared with conventional tests (figure 1). Also, the serial TEG analysis of a dog with disseminated intravascular coagulation represented more hypocoagulable state over time (figure 2).

Future studies should investigate whether hyperfibrinolysis contributes to the propensity to bleed in Greyhounds. The platelet aggregometry results were significantly lower for both agonists in Greyhounds as compared to Beagles which could be erroneously interpreted as decreased platelet function in this breed. Therefore, just as hematocrit and platelet count can affect TEG tracings, the same considerations should be applied to whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry. Both the high hematocrit and low platelet counts in healthy Greyhounds can potentially contribute to lower aggregometry readings due to suspected in vitro effects rather than reflecting true in vivo effects since other studies have demonstrated normal platelet function in Greyhounds. Therefore, it is not recommended to compare whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry measurements of Greyhounds to non\u2010Greyhounds.

Reports of chronic hepatitis caused by Leptospira spp. with absence of renal involvement are confined to small case series in individual kennels. To date, the role of this organism in idiopathic chronic hepatitis remains unknown. However, with the recent availability of Fluorescence In\u2010Situ Hybridisation (FISH), accurate identification of spirochaetes in liver samples is possible. Consequently, this may help elucidate the role of the organism in cases of chronic canine hepatitis. The aim of this study was to describe the clinico\u2010histopathological presentation of cases of hepatic leptospirosis diagnosed by FISH, with an absence of renal involvement.",

CAD is a multifaceted disease resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Both of these factors can shape skin barrier function and the immunological response of predisposed patients. CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Regulatory T cells (Tregs) become known to prevent excessive immune responses through their immunoregulatory properties and therefore play a leading role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis. There was only few researches that was performed to analyze the relationship between CAD and proportion of Tregs in periphery blood. In the present study, the aims were to assess the proportion of circulating Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + , CD4 + FoxP3 + ) in the healthy and the atopic dogs to analyze implication of Tregs to CAD and to investigate the correlation of Tregs with CAD severity and age.",

Deletion would be expected to produce an increase in the severity of disease. Since 12/15\u2010LO has a role in regulating inflammation, our hypothesis is pneumonic tularemia in mice would produce increases in morbidity and mortality. Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (Ft LVS) is pathogenic to mice but not to people. C3H wild type (WT) and 12/15 LO knock out (KO) mice were infected intratracheally with a sublethal dose of Ft LVS and their weights were monitored for 10 days. On day 10 post\u2010infection the mice were euthanized and the lungs, spleens, and liver were collected for analysis. The cellular phenotype of infiltrating inflammatory cells, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and KC levels were determined from lung tissue. Histopathology was assessed from the lung and liver, and splenic weights were determined. 12/15 LO KO mice had increased morbidity compared to WT mice indicated by their significant weight loss. KC, a chemoattractant for neutrophils, was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the lung tissue of KO mice. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils, T cells, and macrophages) and pulmonary histopathology scores were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in KO mice. In contrast LTB4, which assists in host defense was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in 12/15 LO KO mice. Splenic weights were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than WT spleens correlating with the severity of disease. Given this information, 12/15 LO plays a role in regulating inflammation in pneumonic Tularemia. Eicosanoids are highly conserved among species and It is possible that 12/15 LO agonists may be used as natural therapeutics to aide in the resolution of pneumonia in domestic animals, but further studies are needed.",

Although MSCs have been applied in the treatment in various inflammatory diseases, mechanistic research on feline MSCs is lacking. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to analyse the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs isolated from feline adipose tissue (fAT\u2010MSCs). Cytokine expression in RAW264.7 murine macrophages and allogeneic feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs) was measured using quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) and compared according to the presence of fAT\u2010MSCs. We also extracted RNA and collected supernatants from fAT\u2010MSCs for measurement of soluble factor expression levels by qRT\u2010PCR and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, e.g., tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2, were significantly decreased in coculture of mitogen\u2010stimulated RAW264.7 cells with fAT\u2010MSCs compared with that in RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, the expression of immunomodulatory factors from fAT\u2010MSCs, including cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102), transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010\u03b2, indoleamine\u20102,3\u2010dioxygenase (IDO) and hepatocyte growth factor, increased in the presence of RAW264.7 cells. Expression of pro\u2010inflammatory TNF\u2010\u03b1, interferon\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20106 decreased, and expression of anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u201010 increased during coculture of mitogen\u2010stimulated allogeneic fPBMCs with fAT\u2010MSCs. TGF\u2010\u03b2, COX\u20102 and IDO expression and prostaglandin E\u20102 production from fAT\u2010MSCs increased in the presence of allogeneic fPBMCs. Our data suggested that soluble factors secreted from fAT\u2010MSCs play an important role in the immunomodulatory effects of these cells. These findings may be helpful in the application of fAT\u2010MSCs to feline patients with immune\u2010related diseases.\n",

            "text": "Heartworm antigen testing is routinely performed to diagnose heartworm infections in dogs. The original diagnostic tests employed immune complex dissociation (ICD) methods to release antigen that was bound by endogenous canine antibodies. However, ICD methods were discontinued in the majority of commercially available assays due to improvements in assay technology (O'Connor T, et al. \u201cImmunoassay applications in veterinary diagnostics.\u201d In: Wild D, ed. The Immunoassay Handbook. 4th ed. Great Britain: Elsevier, 2013: 623\u2013645). Interference from immune complexes is not unique to heartworm diagnostics and various methods are available for ICD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different methods of ICD for the detection of free heartworm antigen by microtiter plate ELISA and evaluate the performance of ICD in pet dogs. The original, USDA licensed PetChek\u00ae Heartworm Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) utilized pepsin at an acidic pH for ICD prior to antigen testing. Using a set of experimental samples, the pepsin method was compared to heat treatment, and acid treatment. All methods were found to release complexed antigen and produce positive results when the post\u2010treatment samples were tested for heartworm antigen by microtiter plate ELISA. While heat treatment required a minimum of 600 \u03bcL of either serum or plasma, the pepsin and acid methods needed only 50 \u03bcL of the patient sample. To extend this to a field population, samples from 1115 patients were submitted to IDEXX Laboratories between 2014 and 2016 for investigation of discrepant heartworm results. Samples were evaluated with and without pepsin ICD using PetChek\u00ae Heartworm. A total of 112 patients became antigen positive with the ICD protocol only, 122 were positive with and without ICD but demonstrated at least a 50% increase in plate absorbance (OD), and 109 were positive both with and without ICD but had minimal change in plate OD following ICD. The remaining 772 patients did not have detectable antigen with and without ICD. In a prospective study, dogs receiving pre\u2010adulticide heartworm treatment consisting of a macrocyclic lactone in combination with doxycycline were evaluated in the same way. Serial samples from 12 dogs revealed that 3 had a reduction in free circulating antigen within 4 weeks of initiating treatment. In all cases, free antigen levels could be recovered with ICD. Heartworm antigen testing with ICD can be a valuable adjunct diagnostic for those patients who have discrepant results, have intermittently used a macrocyclic lactone, or are receiving treatment.",

Aim of this study was to provide information about parvovirus DNA\u2010shedding in recently vaccinated, adult, healthy cats and to assess related factors using Chi\u2010squared and Fisher\u2032s exact test. Forty cats were included in the study and were vaccinated with a commercial FPV modified\u2010live vaccine. Feces of cats was tested for the presence of parvovirus DNA on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 by quantitative real\u2010time PCR. Pre\u2010 and post\u2010vaccination serum antibody titers were measured by hemagglutination inhibition on day 0, 7, and 28. Almost one\u2010third of the cats (12/40; 29.3%; 95% CI: 18.0\u201345.6) shed parvovirus DNA during the post\u2010vaccination period. Parvovirus DNA was detectable up to 28 days after immunization. Parvovirus DNA\u2010shedding was significantly associated with a lack of protective pre\u2010vaccination antibody titers (P = 0.016; odds\u2010ratio (OR): 6.44; 95% CI: 1.44\u201328.89) and with post\u2010vaccination titer increases (P = 0.029; OR: 5.00; 95% CI: 1.17\u201321.39). Vaccinated cats can shed of parvovirus DNA at least up to 4 weeks after vaccination and shedding occurs more commonly in cats without protective titers. Post\u2010vaccinal shedding thus can interfere with diagnosis in recently vaccinated cats that are presented with clinical signs suspicious for of panleukopenia.",

Clinically the disease is characterized as a subcutaneous mycosis, with papular lesions with nodular feature or ulcero\u2010gummy. The definitive diagnosis is obtained by the isolation of the fungus in culture. However, the result can take weeks, resulting in a delay to start the appropriate treatment and disease could spread through other community members. The aim of this study was standardization of the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by Cell Block Cytology (CB). CB consists of immediate wet cell fixation in preservative liquid based cytology solution (Surepath, BD), and histological processing. We compared two collecting methods: fine needle aspiration (FNA) and exfoliative brushing (EB) with an endocervical brush. Ten samples of skin lesions of nine suspects cats were collected, (five samples with each method). EB allowed a cell thick sediment, and production of several histological sections, with a slide stained with periodic acid Schiff method. All samples collected by this method showed positive results for fungal structures. FNA cases revealed low cellularity and impossible histological processing. This standardization shows that CB processing is possible with EB of lesions and fixation in cytology preservative solution, allowing storage for up to a month after harvest and further testing, as immunohistochemistry. CB is an alternative for sporotrichosis diagnosis.",

One hundred and twelve dogs (61 females, 51 males) with a median age of 5 years (range: 0.75\u201314 years) were enrolled in the study between July 2016 and November 2016. SNAP\u00ae 4Dx Plus\u00ae results showed that 13 dogs (11.6%) were positive for Ehrlichia spp., while only 1 of 13 was Ehrlichia PCR positive. Eight dogs (7.1%) were PCR positive for a vector\u2010borne pathogen, with 6/8 infected with Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum, 1 with Mycoplasma haemocanis, and 1 with Ehrlichia ewingii. Four of 8 infected dogs had normal CBC and chemistry results, while 2/8 dogs had clinicopathologic abnormalities potentially attributed to vector\u2010borne disease (thrombocytopenia 62,000/uL and hyperglobulinemia 4.0 g/dL). Anemia was not documented in any dog infected with Mycoplasma spp. The prevalence of vector\u2010borne disease in healthy dogs presenting to the Oklahoma State University VTH is fairly low, with Mycoplasma spp. infection being most common.",

Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was a major cause for the development of lymphoma in the past days, however, the majority of lymphoma cases are shifting to FeLV\u2010free cats. But the mechanism of tumorigenesis in these spontaneously developed lymphomas has not been well understood. Under this situation, GHV became a candidate which explain the lymphomagenesis in domestic cats. Recent study identified a novel GHV in domestic cats (Felis catus GHV, FcaGHV), and epidemiological surveys found that FcaGHVs are distributing in several countries including the United States, Australia, Singapore, Germany and Austria.

Fever, lameness, neutrophilic polyarthritis and neurologic abnormalities are considered common clinical findings in dogs naturally\u2010infected with E. ewingii; however, nonclinical dogs can be PCR+. To further assess the clinicopathologic features in E. ewingii PCR+ cases, we analyzed the medical records of 30 naturally\u2010infected dogs. To be included in this study, dogs had clinical data, archived whole blood available from North Carolina State University\u2010College of Veterinary Medicine, and were E. ewingii PCR (+) and PCR (\u2010) for other vector\u2010borne pathogens including Ehrlichia spp. (E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and Panola Mountain Ehrlichia), Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Hemotropic Mycoplasma spp., and Rickettsia spp. Based upon diagnostic and/or retrospective research testing, all 30 dogs satisfied the inclusion criteria. Frequently reported physical exam findings included joint pain and effusions 10/30 (33.3%); heart murmur 8/30 (26.75); organomegaly 7/30 (23.3%); vomiting 6/30 (20%) and fever 5/30 (16.7%). Of the 30 E. ewingii PCR+ dogs, 28, 26 and 20 had corresponding CBCs, biochemistry panels and urinalyses, respectively. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities included increased abnormal lymphocytes 18/28 (64.3%); neutrophilia 15/28 (53.6%), of which 9/15 (60%) were characterized by a left shift; anemia 14/28 (50%), of which 8/14 (57%) were characterized as regenerative; monocytosis 13/28 (46.4%); lymphopenia 12/28 (42.9%); thrombocytopenia 11/28 (39.3%); elevated ALP 13/26 (50%) and ALT 10/26 (38.5%), of which only two dogs were receiving corticosteroids; hypoalbuminemia 9/26 (34.6%); and elevated creatinine 6/26 (23.1%). Urinalyses abnormalities included albuminuria 11/20 (55%); proteinuria with inactive sediment 6/20 (30%); and bilirubinuria 6/20 (30%). Of the 7 dogs with urine/protein/creatinine ratios, 6 (85.7%) were greater than 1.5 (range: 1.74 \u2013 11.7). Canine vector\u2010borne disease IFA serology results were available for 28/30 (93.3%) dogs (no sera submitted for 2 dogs), of which 13/28 (46.4%) were E. canis IFA seroreactive (titers \u2264 1:256) and 5/28 (17.8%) were R. rickettsii (spotted fever group rickettsia) IFA seroreactive (titers \u2264 1:256). All dogs were Babesia spp., and Bartonella spp. seronegative. Using the SNAP\u00ae4Dx\u00ae Plus test kit, 23/29 (79.3%) serum or blood samples were Ehrlichia (+), 1/29 (3.4%) was Lyme (+) and all dogs were Anaplasma antibody (\u2010) and Dirofilaria immitis antigen (\u2010). The most frequent medical record diagnoses included renal disease 6/30 (20%); IMHA 5/30 (16.7%); neurologic disease 4/30 (13.3%); polyarthritis 3/30 (10%); hepatic disease 3/30 (10%); cancer 3/30 (10%); and other or undiagnosed 3/30 (30%) illnesses. Ehrlichiosis was the sole diagnosis for only 1/30 (0.033%) dogs and was listed concurrently with other diagnoses for 8 (26.6%) dogs. We hypothesize that infection with E. ewingii may contribute to co\u2010morbidities or function as a precipitating factor in a spectrum of clinical syndromes in dogs. This hypothesis will be tested using inferential statistics and a large diagnostic data set from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.",

Five aliquots of each urine sample were subjected to each of nine storage conditions: in three types of container (glass, propylene copolymer, and homopolymer propylene) at either 24\u00b0C for 4 hours, 4\u00b0C for 12 hours, or \u221220\u00b0C for 72 hours.

With a power of 80%, an alpha of 5%, and a standard deviation of 0.3 for severely proteinuric animals and 0.1 for mildly proteinuric animals (based on pilot study), 4 samples would be needed to detect an approximate 10% decrease in UPC in a severely proteinuric sample (from 10 to 9) and an approximate 33% decrease in the UPC in a mildly proteinuric animal (from 0.6 to 0.4).

Blood and urine samples were collected on days \u22121, 8, 15, 30, and 56 for urine specific gravity (USG), creatinine, and osmolality measurements. Endogenous creatinine\u2010based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated from sample collection on days 28\u201330 or 31\u201333. Baseline W and calorie intake were similar between groups. Although no difference was observed between groups during the treatment phase, TW group had a daily liquid increase of 52%, with a median intake across all days that ranged from 5% to 254% increase. Variance was controlled post hoc with cats characterized as responders (R:consumption >25%) and non\u2010responders (NR) (W: 2R/7NR versus TW: 7R/2NR; P = 0.02). Daily urine volume (mL/kg BW) was higher (P = 0.02) in TW (15.2 \u00b1 SE 1.8) versus the W treated cats (10.3 \u00b1  SE 0.7), but no difference (P = 0.60) between groups for GFR (1.8 \u00b1 SE 0.1 versus 1.9 \u00b1 SE 0.2, respectively). Baseline USG was similar between groups (1.052 g/mL), but declined (ANOVA P < 0.01) with TW (1.037 g/mL \u00b1SE 0.005) versus W (1.053 g/mL \u00b1SE 0.002). Serum osmolality was similar for both groups over the entire trial. This study suggests that specific nutrients added to a cat's water can improve liquid intake to significantly improve overall hydration, as determined by greater urine output and dilution, which may offer a health benefit to some cats in need of greater water consumption.",

Therefore, it is expected larger amounts of this protein in the urine of healthy individuals. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) dogs, a few investigations have reported about the quantities of THP in urine. Lower urinary excretion of THP in CKD dogs might be associated with distal tubular injuries and/or to the loss of renal mass, and then, THP may act as a marker of disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the role of THP as a marker of CKD progression in dogs. Nine clinically healthy dogs were recruited as control group. Forty CKD dogs were enrolled (IRIS staging, Stage 1, n = 10; Stage 2, n = 10; Stage 3, n = 10; Stage 4, n = 10). Western blotting of THP was performed, and the results of densitometry were expressed in mean \u00b1 SEM. Urinary immunodetection of THP was 100.0 \u00b1 7.7% in control dogs, and 117.2 \u00b1 10.8%, 86.0 \u00b1 9.0%, 65.4 \u00b1 8.7% and 46.7 \u00b1 9.0% in CKD dogs in stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Differences among all groups were observed, particularly between Stages 1 and 4 (P \u2264 0.0001).

It was recently shown that dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased FGF\u201023 concentrations. FGF\u201023 increases urinary fractional excretion of phosphorus (uFEP) in order to limit increases in serum phosphorus. The phosphaturic activity of FGF\u201023 is based on suppression of renal P reabsorption in the proximal tubules. Recently human studies showed that uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio may reflect functional nephrons and the phosphaturic actions of FGF\u201023, and can be used as prognostic marker of CKD. A low uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio may indicate a reduction in the number of functional nephrons and/or impaired FGF\u201023 signaling from Klotho (co\u2010receptor for FGF\u201023) expression. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio reflect severity of CKD and could predict prognosis of CKD dogs. Sixteen CKD dogs were followed\u2010up for 13 months or until death (IRIS stage 2, n = 5; stage 3, n = 11). Urinary and serum phosphorus as well as serum FGF\u201023 were measured at the first visit. The uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio was determined in fifteen healthy dogs (mean \u00b1 SEM; 0.083 \u00b1 0.024). Normophosphatemia (3.54 \u00b1 0.07 mg/dL; range 2.3 to 5.4 mg/dL) was detected in all CKD dogs in stage 2 most of the times during the follow\u2010up, and hyperphosphatemia detected in 8 out of 11 dogs in stage 3 (5.68 \u00b1 0.23 mg/dL; range 2.5 to 16.0 mg/dL). The uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio was 0.027 \u00b1 0.014 in stage 2 CKD, and 0.006 \u00b1 0.003 in stage 3 CKD (P = 0.0122). Serum FGF\u201023 concentrations were higher in stage 3 and even though FGF\u201023 was increased, there was no increment in phosphaturia. CKD dogs in stage 3 with lower uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratios had a poorer prognosis. Decreased survival was predicted when uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratios were less than 0.006 (survival up to 300 days). The worst prognosis occurred when uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio was < 0.003 (less than 130 days survival). In conclusion, a low uFEP/FGF\u201023 ratio associated with normal to high serum FGF\u201023 concentrations supports a reduction in functional nephrons and/or impaired FGF\u201023 signaling from renal injury since increased FGF\u201023 should promote sufficient phosphaturia. Evaluation of Klotho (serum, urine, renal tissue) will be valuable to this question. Studies with larger population of dogs in various IRIS CKD stages will confirm the prognostic value of uFEP/FGF\u201023 in dogs with spontaneous chronic kidney disease.",

Body composition during this preweaning period has not been well\u2010studied because sedation was previously required for analysis. Quantitative Magnetic Resonance (QMR) is a noninvasive technology that does not require anesthesia and has been validated as a method to assess body fat, lean, and total body water (TBW) in companion animals. The objective of this study was to determine if QMR can be used to measure body composition in puppies during the preweaning period. Healthy newborn puppies (Labrador retrievers and beagles; n = 16/breed) were selected for this study. Body weights were collected and QMR scans were performed on awake and unrestrained puppies within 24 hours of birth, and then at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. Differences in weight, percent lean, body fat, TBW, and lean mass hydration were assessed. Body weight was higher for Labrador retrievers at all timepoints (P < 0.05). Body fat percentage was significantly higher in beagle puppies at birth, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Although lean mass percentage was similar between breeds at birth, Labrador retrievers had significantly higher proportion at Weeks 2 and 4 (P < 0.05). No breed differences were observed in TBW percentage at any time period, but beagles had significantly higher lean mass hydration at birth (P < 0.05). These results indicate QMR can be used to detect differences in body composition during the critical preweaning period. Further research evaluating differences in body composition among dog breeds during growth is required.",

The CD4 cell activation assay was modeled on a commercially available human assay of activated CD4 positive T cell ATP synthesis that is marketed as a non\u2010specific test of the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Briefly, CD4 positive cells were magnetically sorted from PBMCs following activation with ConA, cells were lysed to release intracellular ATP, a luminescence reagent (luciferin/luciferase) activated by ATP was added, and resultant bioluminescence was measured using a luminometer.

Aspirin resistance may be a contributing factor to the development of life threatening thrombi thus increasing the rate of morbidity and mortality in several canine diseases. Understanding the phenomenon of aspirin resistance and developing methods for predicting it could lead to improvements in survival in these patients. The cause of aspirin resistance remains unclear.

Aspirin responsiveness in vitro did not correlate with responsiveness in vivo in this scenario. The use of EDTA fluoride anticoagulant resulted in inhibition of conversion of ASA to SA suggesting successful inhibition of esterase activity. When storing dog plasma samples containing aspirin, the use of EDTA containing fluoride may prevent esterase hydrolysis of the ASA.

The mechanism for this delay in the immunosuppressive effects of MMF has not been elucidated, although another purine synthesis inhibitor, azathioprine, is also reported to have a delayed effect, the cause of which has also not yet been determined. Diarrhea was, as has been previously reported, the most common dose\u2010limiting side effect in our study. The exact mechanism of MMF\u2010associated diarrhea has not been determined in either humans or dogs. Interestingly, in some dogs, drug\u2010induced diarrhea, as with drug effects on lymphocyte proliferation, appears to be delayed until after the first week of therapy. Since a lower oral dose rate (10 mg/kg bid) of MMF still causes significant suppression of lymphocyte proliferation in some dogs, without associated diarrhea, this reduced dose rate warrants exploration in future pharmacodynamic studies.\n\n",

Based on in silico predictions, we hypothesized that the 729A>G SNP would decrease protein synthesis and total cellular cytochrome b5 reductase activity without decreasing mRNA expression in an in vitro model. HepG2 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing either wildtype (A) or variant (G) CYB5R3 cDNA and incubated for 48 hours.

There was no significant difference in protein expression between the A and G alleles. mRNA quantification and cytochrome b5 reductase activity assays are underway. Preliminary results do not support CYB5R3 729A>G as a functional variant leading to decreased cytochrome b5 reductase expression. However, immunoreactivity is only a semi\u2010quantitative measure of protein expression; results of mRNA and enzyme activity assays may better inform the mechanistic significance of 729A>G SNP in sulfonamide hypersensitivity in dogs.",

Cats included in the study had orthogonal thoracic radiographs performed, a complete medical record, and a definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis based on identification of H. capsulatum, positive urine antigen, and/or positive fungal culture. A radiologist blinded to the clinical severity of each patient evaluated all radiographs to determine the predominant pulmonary pattern and severity score (0\u2010normal, 1\u2010mild, 2\u2010moderate, 3\u2010severe) for each lung lobe. Forty\u2010seven cats (27 female, 20 male) were included in the study with a median age of 7 years (range: 0.7 \u2013 19 years) of which 32 (68%) were presumed to be alive at the time of this abstract. The predominant pulmonary pattern was bronchial in 38 cats (81%) and 6 cats (13%) had a mixed pulmonary pattern (combination of bronchial, interstitial, and/or alveolar). Three cats (6%) had bilateral pleural effusion and 3 cats (6%) had normal radiographs. All lung lobes were abnormal in the majority of cats and the median severity score of all lung lobes was 2 out of 3 (moderate). Feline histoplasmosis results in pulmonary abnormalities in the majority of cats infected, and the predominant pulmonary pattern is a moderate bronchial pattern with or without an interstitial component.",

We hypothesized that inspiratory to expiratory change in lung area as assessed by fluoroscopy would result in reproducible measures that could be used for future evaluation of lung function and mechanics in dogs with respiratory disease. Forty\u2010four conscious, unsedated dogs with no evidence of respiratory disease were minimally restrained in sternal recumbency. Tidal respiration was recorded fluoroscopically for 10 respiratory cycles, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory images from 3 respiratory cycles were evaluated. The number of pixels in the entire thoracic cavity was measured for both inspiration and expiration, and the average percent change in thoracic dimension was determined for each dog. This process was repeated using a hemithorax measurement that excluded the mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. Reference ranges with 95% confidence were computed using a non\u2010parametric percentile distribution. Median percent change in thoracic dimension for the total thorax measurement was 12.5% (confidence interval of 8.91\u201323.97%). Median percent change for the hemithorax measurement (20.8%) was significantly different (P < 0.001) with a larger confidence interval of 14.32\u201337.61%, rendering it more responsive to lung area changes. Neither measurement technique was correlated with age, sex, thoracic conformation, BCS, or breed but varied with body weight above and below 10 kg. In conclusion, fluoroscopy provides a noninvasive and reliable measure of lung area changes during respiration in small and large dogs. Further investigations of lung area changes are required in dogs with respiratory disease to assess its utility in detecting dysfunction.",

Previous work from our lab has confirmed that the pathophysiology of EMS is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the phenotypic variability in metabolic traits. The objective of this project was to identify genomic regions contributing to EMS by performing a genome\u2010wide association study (GWAS) in a cohort of 232 Welsh ponies and 286 Morgan horses phenotyped for 11 metabolic traits. Genotyping was performed on one of three SNP arrays (54,000, 670,000 to 1,800,000 SNPs); genotype imputation allowed for generation of a uniform set of makers across platforms (\u02dc1.8 million SNPs). GWAS was performed using a mixed linear regression model with sex and age included as covariates. Within breeds, a total of 67 (Welsh ponies) and 116 (Morgans) significant loci were identified for the metabolic traits, of which 4 were shared between breeds. Loci were defined as shared if SNPs with a P\u2010value < 1.00e\u201005 were within a 500 kb window of each other. Specifically, shared loci were identified on ECA10, ECA18, ECA20, and ECA3 for insulin levels post oral sugar test, and baseline non\u2010esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, and ACTH, respectively, with a total of 75 candidate genes identified. These data confirm that EMS is a polygenic trait with risk loci unique to individual breeds as well as those shared between breeds. Future directions include interrogation of these regions through whole genome sequencing.",

Analysis of the named fecal metabolites found 100 that were significantly different among study days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Those metabolites that were most statistically significant (P < 0.05, q = 0.041) were active in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, steroids, proteins, carbohydrates, sucrose, and starches.

MoDCs were incubated for 48 hours with or without killed Escherichia coli or Staphlococcous aureus antigen in the presence or absence of cortisol (15 \u03bcg/dL).

Ingestion and absorption of immunoglobulin\u2010rich colostrum are the sole means of passive transfer in foals providing temporary protection from infection for the first few months of life. Current recommendations for optimizing colostral antibody transfer from mares to foals includes vaccination of the mare 4 to 6 weeks prior to parturition. This practice has been recommended to increase the serum antibody level in the dam; therefore the mare would concentrate a higher level of Ig in colostrum during the final two weeks of gestation. Although this management practice is widely accepted, it has not been adequately substantiated using evidenced\u2010based medicine from adequately controlled studies. The purpose of this study was to determine if vaccinating pregnant mares approximately 4 to 6 weeks prior to foaling increases the IgG antibody transferred to foals specific for West Nile Virus (WNV) and Equine Influenza Virus (EIV). Twenty\u2010seven pregnant adult Tennessee Walking Horse (TWH) mares ranging in age from 5 to 23 years were enrolled in the study. All mares were confirmed in foal via rectal palpation and confirmed via ultrasound. Mares were randomized into three treatment groups: G0 na\u00efve control group (no previous vaccinations; no vaccinations administered during the study); G1 vaccinated group (initial 2 vaccination series and revaccinated 4 to 6 weeks prior to foaling); and G2 vaccinated group (initial 2 vaccination series; no pre\u2010foaling revaccination). Mares in G1 and G2 were administered Vetera\u00ae 4XP + WNV (eastern and western encephalitis, equine influenza clades 1 and 2 +  WNV) labeled safe for use in pregnant mares. Following parturition, blood was collected and processed from each foal to determine IgG levels (passive immunity) and serum aliquots frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Serum was shipped to Gluck Equine Research Center, Lexington, KY for measurement of serum hemagglutination\u2010inhibiting (HI) equine influenza virus antibody levels against Kentucky/14 (Florida clade 1) and Ayrshire/13 (Florida clade 2) reference strains and samples were shipped to Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Ithaca, NY for analysis of WNV IgG antibody levels measured by ELISA. The mean antibody level was reported accompanied by standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. Serological titer values below the quantifiable limit were reported as \u2018< 10\u2019 and the value of 5 was substituted for these analyses, which provided a conservative estimate. The null hypothesis there was no vaccination effect was tested with a mixed model repeated measures methodology with subject as a random effect. All pairwise comparisons were reported between vaccination groups. Models were run separately for each reference strain. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Some advocate the use of acute phase proteins in addition to serology, which alone results in substantial false positives. Serum and CSF CRP and SAA were measured in 25 cases of equine neurologic disease: EPM (10), cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM) (10), neuroborreliosis (2), equine motor neuron disease (1), degenerative myelopathy (1), and leukoencephalomalacia (1). Nine of 10 EPM cases had serum:CSF SnSAG2, 4/3 titer ratios \u2264 25. The untested EPM case was confirmed postmortem, as were 4 other EPM cases. Nine of the 10 CVSM cases were confirmed postmortem, and the other case had a positive myelogram and SNSAG2, 4/3 titer ratio of 200. The remaining cases were diagnosed on postmortem exam. Serum CRP was not elevated in any case. Serum SAA was only elevated in the two cases of neuroborreliosis (132 mg/L and 460 mg/L; reference 0\u201320 mg/L) suggesting SAA may aid its diagnosis, but further testing is warranted. Neither serum CRP nor SAA increased in cases of EPM or CVSM. Cerebrospinal fluid CRP and SAA also failed to differentiate cases of EPM (CRP median 3.35 mg/L, range 0.19\u201313.43 mg/L; SAA median 0.1 mg/L, range < 0.1\u20132.4 mg/L) from CVSM (CRP median 4.015 mg/L, range 0.16\u20139.62 mg/L; SAA median 0.62 mg/L, range < 0.1\u20132.91 mg/L).",

We hypothesized that calcium dysregulation in RER horses could be impacted by genes encoding newly discovered micropeptides such as sarcolipin (SLN), myoregulin (MRLN), DWORF and phospholamban (PLN) that modify the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA).

The objective of this project is to identify variants associated with RER. In both breeds, total phenotypic variance is explained by < 1% of the SNPs tested. These SNPs were further partitioned based on estimated effect sizes. In the TB, SNPs of small, moderate, and large effect account for 45%, 35%, and 20% of the phenotypic variability, respectively. Similarly, in STDBs, small, moderate, and large effect SNPs explain 47%, 30%, and 23% variability, respectively. Genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) identified seven genomic regions of interest (ROIs) significantly associated with RER in TB (n = 491) and STDB (n = 476) horses: two in TBs, four in STDBs, and one shared locus. Of the 274 genes within these ROIs, 34 were computationally predicted to be candidate genes for rhabdomyolysis in humans. Variants in each ROI were identified using whole genome sequences from 10 RER and 10 controls in each breed. 189,610 total variants were discovered in the ROIs, with an average of 7.5 variants per kb. Of these variants, 47.5% were within genes, and 1.1% had putative functional effects. Variants will be prioritized based on segregation between RER and control horses and predicted functional effect. High\u2010priority variants will be used to create an assay for genotyping in the entire GWAS population.",

In a recent study Draft and Warmblood breeds were more likely to be presented with atrial fibrillation in comparison to most light breeds, with the exception of Standardbreds. To our knowledge there is no data describing a population of competition ready Draft horses. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of silent cardiac arrhythmias in a population of Draft horses. A convenience sample of 245 Draft horses was studied at the 2015 Michigan Great Lakes International Draft Horse Show. Information gathered on each horse included signalment, history of poor performance, upper airway noise, myopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias or murmurs. All horses were auscultated on each side of the thorax for 30 seconds. A 30\u2010second electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was then taken using a handheld recording device that transmitted to a smart phone (AliveCor\u00ae). ECG recordings were evaluated for rhythm and heart rate, P\u2010R interval, and R\u2010R interval were measured. The study population included 82 Percherons, 69 Belgians, 69 Clydesdales, 11 Belgian mules, 8 Shires, and 5 Percheron mules. Arrhythmias were found in four horses: atrial fibrillation (1), ventricular premature depolarizations (1), second degree atrioventricular block (2). None of these horses had a history of poor performance or known cardiac arrhythmias. We concluded that the prevalence of silent arrhythmias in well\u2010conditioned, competitive Draft horses is low (2/245; 0.8%).",

The decrease in hair cortisol concentrations between 1 and 2\u2010months post\u2010castration was significantly lower in castrated males than intact females. Cortisol accumulation in the month after castration could explain the significantly smaller decrease in HCC concentrations in males than females during the same time period.

Particularly difficult may be the diagnosis of horses with PPID in the equine athlete. Many of the same clinical signs identified in early or advanced PPID may be recognized in the sport horse along with tendon or suspensory ligament degeneration. Suspensory ligament injuries have been considered a common cause of lameness, in the equine athlete involved in competitive events.

The most common diagnostic test utilized by veterinary practitioners for the diagnosis of PPID is currently measurement of basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. Determination of resting plasma ACTH concentration has been the most practical diagnostic test for PPID likely due to the ease of collection and the availability of seasonal reference ranges that allow for testing any time of the year. Multiple recommendations exist concerning the in vitro stability of ACTH. Most all recommendations state samples should be chilled promptly after collection. Multiple recommendations exist for the timing of centrifugation of chilled samples from sample collection. In the US, a discordance exists between laboratory recommendations concerning centrifugation time from sample collection; anywhere from 2 hours up to 4 hours from sample collection. Realistically, many equine ambulatory practitioners do not have the ability to centrifuge the sample within 2 to 4 hours.

Data from all horses that underwent SI colic surgery and received 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX) was extracted from clinical records (61 horses). Thirty\u2010two horses underwent (SI) resection and 29 did not. Data from 61 horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected sequentially from clinic records for comparison. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed (if any). Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Fewer horses produced gastric reflux when dexamethasone was administered (DEX 13/61; NoDEX 21/61, P = 0.1570). Nasogastric reflux produced (litres) was lower when horses received dexamethasone, (DEX 12.06 + /\u221235.73, NoDEX 16.85 + /\u221238.90, P = 0.4841). Differences were not statistically significant.

Fewer surgical incisions became infected in the DEX group with no statistical significant difference (6/61 DEX, 8/61 NoDEX, P = 0.7774). Dexamethasone may have a beneficial effect on the incidence of POI but no statistically significant differences were detected. A single dose of dexamethasone does not have a detrimental effect on short\u2010term survival or increase the risk of incisional infections. A randomized controlled trial is required.",

The percentage of CFU reduction was determined by calculating the ratio of CFUs between T48 and T0 for each treatment and multiplying by 100%. Results showed that phagocytosis varied significantly (P < 0.05) among horses. Additionally, there was no significant difference in phagocytosis (i.e., T0 CFU) between strains (P = 0.27). For both macrolide\u2010susceptible and macrolide\u2010resistant R. equi, treatment with CLR or PULC had marked and significant (P < 0.05) reduction of CFU relative to either negative control or treatment with PUL; for both strains, there were no differences between control and PUL or between CLR and PULC.

Also, they rely solely on compression and do not provide stabilization in tension, which can result in micromotion, potential catastrophic failure, and implant migration. Here we evaluated a novel technique for cervical vertebral interbody fusion in 6 horses with cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy (CVCM). Six horses diagnosed with CVCM with pre\u2010operative ataxia grades ranging from 2\u20134/5 on the modified Mayhew scale underwent this novel approach. Two horses were compressed at 1 site and 4 were compressed at 2 sites (Table). The surgical procedure consisted of creation of an intervertebral disc\u2010space defect and placement of an intervertebral fusion device (IFD), 4 titanium polyaxial pedicle screws and 2 connecting rods secured with set\u2010screws (Figure). All horses were re\u2010evaluated at 7 days, 6 months, and 1\u2010year post\u2010operative. The procedures were approved by the Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Surgery was performed safely and post\u2010operative radiographs showed good placement of all IFDs, screws and rods in all horses. No implant failure or IFD displacement occurred up to 1\u2010year post\u2010operative. All horses improved within 3 months and by 1\u2010year post\u2010operative ataxia had reduced by 1\u20132 grades. The use of this novel fusion system requires less disc space removal, provides stabilization in compression and tension, and was technically straight\u2010forward to perform. Surgery was performed successfully with improvement of clinical signs in all horses. This technique is a promising alternative to current surgical procedures for treatment of CVCM.\n\n",

The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of neuronavigation\u2010guided intracranial procedures in the horse using a standard fiducial array compared to anatomic landmarks for patient registration. Six equine cadaver heads were used for the study. CT images of each specimen were acquired, with the fiducial array rigidly secured to the frontal bone. Six targets were selected in each specimen. Patient registration was performed separately for 3 targets using the fiducial array, and 3 targets using anatomic landmarks. In lieu of biopsy, 22\u2010gauge wire seeds were placed at each targeted site. Postoperative images were coregistered with the planning scan to calculate offset from the tip of the seed to the target. No statistical difference in accuracy between registration techniques was identified. The impact of surgeon experience was examined separately for each technique using a two\u2010sample t\u2010test and the experienced surgeon was significantly more accurate (1.35 mm, SD 0.69) than novice surgeons (4.04 mm, SD 1.78) using the fiducial array (P < 0.01). Although not statistically significant (P = 0.41), for the experienced surgeon the mean distance to target was smaller when registering with the fiducial array (1.35 mm) than natural landmarks (2.24 mm). In conclusion, surgeon experience impacts degree of accuracy. Data also suggest that registration using anatomic landmarks is feasible, but perhaps should be reserved for cases where a separate planning scan with fiducials cannot be performed.",

Because placement of a pulmonary artery catheter in neonatal foals to measure mixed venous blood (SvO2) is clinically impractical, the objective of this study was to evaluate parameters associated with global oxygen from central venous blood in healthy neonatal foals. Specifically, in this study, the following parameters were measured from 12 healthy neonatal foals from central venous (cv) and arterial (a) blood: saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (ScvO2, SaO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PcvO2, PaO2), partial pressure of CO2 (PcvCO2, PaCO2), pH (pHcv, pHa) and L\u2010lactate (Laccv, Laca). Additionally, the following parameters reflecting global oxygenation were calculated: venous\u2010to\u2010arterial CO2 gap (dCO2), oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER), ratio between PaO2 and the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FIO2 ratio) and central venous and arterial bicarbonate (HCO3cv, HCO3a), base excess (BEcv, BEa), hemoglobin (Hbcv, Hba) and oxygen content (O2Ctcv, O2Cta).",

Plasma samples were collected and concentrations of glucose ([gluc]) and cortisol ([cortisol]) determined. Mixed models ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and P < 0.05 was considered significant.",

The aim of the present retrospective analysis was therefore to assess the prognostic relevance of increased plasma L\u2010Lactate concentrations (cL\u2010lactate) in a large study population of hospitalized neonatal calves. For this purpose, the data of 10,060 neonatal calves admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants, LMU Munich, were retrospectively analyzed. L\u2010Lactate was determined as part of a routinely performed clinical biochemistry panel on admission.",
