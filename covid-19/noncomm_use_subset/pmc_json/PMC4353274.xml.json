This created a need to update recommendations for the use of antiviral drugs for this year\u2019s seasonal influenza. The concept was then approved by Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (AMMI) Canada. A first draft was cowritten by all the authors (HGS, FYA, UDA, GAE and ML). Subsequently, all the authors reviewed, revised and approved the document before a further review from the AMMI Canada Guidelines Committee and the Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society. AMMI Canada approved the final document before submission to the Journal for publication.",

Systematic reviews of studies investigating the efficacy of NIs in treating mild to moderate influenza illness in out-patients have not adequately addressed the significantly greater benefit of NI treatment in very ill hospitalized patients, nor the greater benefit of earlier treatment after onset of symptoms (4). Earlier therapy with oral oseltamivir administered within 12 h of symptom onset was shown to reduce symptoms by 3.6 days (5). Inhaled zanamivir shortened the duration of major influenza symptoms by 3 days compared with placebo in individuals who were febrile at enrollment and received zanamivir within 30 h (3). In low-risk outpatients, NI treatment of mild influenza illness may be considered but is optional (6).",

Of course, these values vary depending on the prevalence of influenza in the community relative to other respiratory infections. In older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who have been vaccinated for influenza, only the presence of fever >37.8\u00b0 and myalgias correlated with influenza, but with a lower positive predictive value of 41% (11). Other respiratory viruses, including but not limited to: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus or human metapneumovirus infection, may account for those with non-influenza infection. The use of influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is preferred to direct fluorescent antigen detection (DFA) due to its greater sensitivity. A nasopharyngeal swab is preferred for influenza PCR testing, particularly if the patient requires hospital admission. If the patient is intubated, an endotracheal aspirate can be substituted for an NP swab. If an NP swab has been performed and is negative, and the patient is subsequently intubated, an endotracheal aspirate specimen for PCR should also be performed. Multiplex PCR testing allows for the diagnostic confirmation of other respiratory viruses, although unlike influenza, there are presently no antiviral agents available to treat them.",

However, in severe illness requiring hospitalization, oseltamivir treatment has been shown to reduce mortality even if treatment is started up to 96 h after the start of symptoms (7,8). Following initial clinical assessment and collection of appropriate specimens for virus testing, treatment should be started immediately, most frequently with oseltamivir orally. For adults with normal renal function, the typical regimen is 75 mg every 12 h for five days. In ventilated patients, oseltamivir should be administered by nasogastric tube. If zanamivir is required in a severely ill patient, intravenous zanamivir is recommended at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h. If intravenous zanamivir is needed, it can be obtained by request to the Government of Canada Health Protection Branch, Special Access Program, Ottawa.

Primary influenza pneumonia typically presents with severe shortness of breath and occurs within one to three days of initial symptom onset (12). Clinicians should be aware that the presentation of a biphasic illness with reappearance of fever after defervesence from a typical influenza illness might represent a complicating secondary bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia should be strongly suspected when a typical influenza illness is resolving, usually around the fifth day, and then there is a recurrence of fever and productive cough, often but not always with purulent sputum. In severely ill patients, appropriate antibiotics for community-acquired or nursing home-acquired pneumonia should be instituted immediately, as well as NI antiviral drug treatment, pending an etiologic diagnosis.",

This recommendation differs from that for residents and staff in long-term or chronic care facilities. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for patients may be considered in specific circumstances (eg, in high-risk semi-closed hospital units such as transplant units) when at least one laboratory-confirmed case occurs on a hospital unit. The end of a unit outbreak is generally considered when no new cases of ILI have appeared for \u22657 days after the onset of the last case. Pre-exposure prophylaxis increases the risk of long-term use, and the development of resistance.",
