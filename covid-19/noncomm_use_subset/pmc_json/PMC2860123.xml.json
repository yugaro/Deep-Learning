            "text": "DNA cloning is a defining technique of modern molecular biology. Generally, cloned DNA contains no more than a few genes. Recently, there has been increasing interest in cloning much larger pieces of DNA, including whole genomes. For example, several organelle genomes have been cloned. The 16-kb mouse mitochondrial genome has been cloned in Escherichia coli (1,2), Bacillus subtilis (1,3) and yeast (4). The 139-kb maize chloroplast genome has been cloned in yeast (5), and the 135-kb rice chloroplast genome has been cloned in B. subtilis (1). Viral genomes have been cloned in E. coli, including those from a number of herpesviruses (6) as well as baculoviruses (7\u20139), coronaviruses (10) and a poxvirus (11). A 36-kb human adenovirus type 2 genome (12) and a 178-kb fragment of the human cytomegalovirus genome (13) have been cloned in yeast. As for bacteria, \u223c10% of the 1.8-Mb Haemophilus influenzae genome has been cloned as two separate episomal elements in E. coli (14). The 3.5-Mb Synechocystis PCC6803 genome was inserted in three discontiguous regions into the B. subtilis genome, with the exception of the two ribosomal RNA operons (15). We have reported the cloning of a completely synthetic 0.6-Mb Mycoplasma genitalium genome in yeast as a circular yeast centromeric plasmid (YCp) (16,17). We have also reported the cloning of the natural 1.1-Mb genome isolated from M. mycoides subspecies capri in yeast as a YCp (18).",

The sequence has been deposited in GenBank with the accession number GU593054. Primers (IDT) and templates used for the construction are outlined in Supplementary Table S1. Ten nanograms of plasmid was used as template in a 100-\u00b5l polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion DNA polymerase and HF buffer (NEB), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, except that extra magnesium chloride (MgCl2) was added for a final concentration of 2 or 3 mM. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 46\u201359\u00b0C (cycles 1\u20135) or 51\u201364\u00b0C (cycles 6\u201330) for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, followed by 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Specific annealing temperatures (\u00b0C) for PCR cycles 1\u20135 were as follows: bla (ampicillin resistance) and pUC19 origin, 56 and 59; lacZ, 46 and 48; tetM, 46 and 50; transposase, 46; HIS3 and ARSH4-CEN6, 48 and 52. Annealing temperatures for cycles 6\u201330 were 5\u00b0C higher. PCR products of each amplicon were pooled and each amplicon was gel purified and recovered using \u03b2-agarase (NEB). The transposase was initially hard to amplify from the template pISM31.1, possibly because one of the PCR primers used contained not only 20 bp of homology to the template at the desired location, but also 26 bp of homology to two copies of the IS256 inverted repeat present in other parts of the plasmid. These IS256 copies were separated from the desired template portion of pISM31.1 with a double digest with PciI and SalI, followed by gel-purification and use of the 3.7-kb fragment. The entire CBA reaction was repaired (16), then phenol extracted, isopropanol precipitated, resuspended and electroporated into EPI300 cells (Epicentre). Transformants were selected for carbenicillin resistance. Clones were screened for size by three separate restriction digests, but the plasmid was not sequenced. Instead, its elements were tested phenotypically. Propagation in E. coli ensured functionality of the pUC19 origin, while selection in E. coli with carbenicillin and tetracycline and screening with X-gal tested the intactness of the bla, tetM and lacZ markers. Successful transformation of yeast showed that the HIS3, ARSH4 and CEN6 markers were viable. Function of the transposon was tested by transformation into mycoplasma.",

The URA3 gene was PCR amplified from the plasmid pRS306 (32) by primer pair ARS-URA (5\u2032-TTCGTGTGTGGTCTTC TACACAGACAAGATGAAACAATTCGG CATTAATATTGATTTCGGTTTCTTTGAA-3\u2032) and URA-R-GAL (5\u2032-CTCGGCGGCTTCTAATCCGTGGGTAATAACTGATATAATT-3\u2032), and the GAL1 promoter was amplified from the plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen) by primer GAL-F-URA (5\u2032-AATTATATCAGTTATTACCCACGGATTAGAAGCCGCCGAG-3\u2032) and GAL-CEN (5\u2032-GGATCGCCAACAA ATACTACCTTTTATCTTGCTCTTC CTGCTCTCAGGCCGGTTTTTTCTCCTTGACGTTAA-3\u2032). The 40 nts of overlapping sequence is in bold. The 1.5-kb fusion product was integrated into the target site by homologous recombination at the 50-bp underlined sequences. The other fragment replaced the yeast vector insertion in RNaseP with M. genitalium sequence such that the coding region of this gene was restored. This 302-bp fragment was generated by PCR from M. genitalium DNA using primers with the sequences 5\u2032-TTAAAGTCAGTTATTTATCTACAGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTTTAAAGATATATTTAAAGTAGAGG-3\u2032. Before cotransformation, TRP1 was inserted into MG411. An 1177-bp TRP1 gene fragment with homology to MG411 was amplified from the plasmid pRS304 using two primers with sequences 5\u2032-CAGATGGTATTCCTGAA AGGATATCAATAATAAGTGAAAGT TTTTTTCTTATTTTTGGTTCAGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTAATTATTGCTAGTT ATATAGGGGTTAGAACTTCATT TTTCCTTGTTTATCGATGCACGCATCTGTGCGGTATTTCA-3\u2032 (M. genitalium sequence is in bold). TRP1 gene insertion was checked with a set of primers (sequences 5\u2032-GCCATTGTTTCACTAATTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TAATCCTATCTTTGGAGCTT-3\u2032) that amplified 1739 bp if insertion occurred and 680 bp if it did not. Cotransformants which were His-Trp- Ura+ were selected. Restoration of RNaseP was confirmed by PCR amplification of a 513-bp product using primers with sequences 5\u2032-CTCCATCATGCGCAGTAATA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTTTAAAGATATATTTAAAGTAGAGG-3\u2032. Replacement of TRP1 with yeast vector sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification of an 1841-bp product using primers with sequences 5\u2032-TTGATTTCGGTTTCTTTGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGGCAGGAATTTGATTCCC-3\u2032.",

The approach of Figure 1B does not require transformation or even cultivation of the organism, just intact genomic DNA. This method is favored for genetically intractable or uncultured organisms. These may include pathogens and environmental isolates. However, this strategy does not guarantee fitness or viability of the cloned genome. In addition, it may be difficult to find a suitable restriction site for vector insertion, and vector insertion may require some sequence knowledge. The approach of Figure 1C is useful for assembling pieces of DNA, both natural and synthetic.

Selection in liquid culture took several weeks less than plating the transformation mixture and then expanding the resulting individual colonies in liquid medium. When analyzed by restriction digestion, the pool of transformants gave discrete bands whose sizes summed to one M. pneumoniae genome (Figure 3M, label \u2018Mp\u2019). This indicated a predominant vector insertion site. Direct genomic sequencing with primers internal to the vector was unsuccessful. Thus, DNA from the pool was electroporated into E. coli. Incubation of transformants with kanamycin selected circularized M. pneumoniae fragments that contained the vector, which included BAC sequences. Plasmid DNA from one such transformant was isolated and sequenced. It contained insertion of the vector by transposition within MPN028, after the base pair corresponding to 33901 in the M. pneumoniae M129 sequence (GenBank accession U00089), with a duplication of bp 33893\u201333901. This gene has been shown to be nonessential in M. genitalium, but not in M. pneumoniae. However, the vector insertion occurred near the 3\u2032-end of the gene, which may not be disruptive to gene function (44,45). The restriction map produced by vector insertion at this location matched our results. This genome was named YCpMpn028 (Figure 2E).",

The transcription (60) and translation (61) signals in yeast are different from those in bacteria. In addition, mycoplasmas use the codon UGA for tryptophan rather than as a translation stop signal.

A half-genome synthetic M. genitalium molecule that was also cloned in yeast was moved to E. coli, isolated and sequenced. This too had the correct sequence (16). We have been able to transplant several variations of an M. mycoides genome from yeast. This shows that yeast has propagated several different M. mycoides genomes with enough fidelity that they are functional. We sequenced a genome from M. mycoides cells that was transplanted out of yeast, and aside from changes that we had engineered in yeast, it contained the same sequence as the molecule that was cloned into yeast (18). These results confirm that two different mycoplasma genomes are accurately propagated in yeast.",
