            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus first identified in 2001 as a pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [1]. Seroprevalence studies show that almost all children acquire infection by 5 years of age, and that frequent reinfections occur through life [2, 3]. The prevalence of hMPV infection among hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection or fever is similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Clinical disease most closely resembles that associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), a related paramyxovirus [4]. A prospective cohort study of hMPV revealed a 9.4% seroprevalence in children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections, with 63% of patients requiring supplemental oxygen and 3% requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [5]. Lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTI) caused by hMPV includes bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup. hMPV is also associated with acute otitis media, as well as more rarely conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and rash [6, 7]. In adults with hematologic malignancy, hMPV is associated with high rates of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease and substantial mortality [8, 9].",

Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue shown in in-vitro studies to have activity against hMPV [11]. Ribavirin is approved for use in treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and is often used in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in severely immunocompromised individuals. Few prior descriptions of the clinical management and treatment of hMPV respiratory tract infections in a pediatric immunocompromised population, including children with leukemia and solid organ transplant recipients, are available. We describe hMPV respiratory tract infections in 55 pediatric immunocompromised patients at Seattle Children's Hospital, reporting on their clinical presentation, management, and outcomes.",

Of 368 total patients with positive hMPV laboratory results, we performed retrospective chart review to identify a subset of 55 patients with immunocompromised conditions. We defined an immunocompromised condition as presence of hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, rheumatologic disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant, primary immunodeficiency, receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Using electronic chart review, we abstracted sociodemographic variables, symptoms, laboratory and radiologic values, clinical course, and treatment outcomes for these patients.",

Estimated viral load data were calculated from cycle threshold values on RT-qPCR analysis using stored standard curve data for hMPV. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as hMPV documented in an upper respiratory tract specimen in a patient with compatible symptoms in the absence of radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. LRTI was defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate or presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms (wheezing or hypoxia) in association with a positive lower respiratory tract specimen or a positive upper respiratory tract specimen if the patient did not undergo BAL. Neutropenia was defined as absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/mL.

The presentation of hMPV in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients was shown to be similar to patients with other immunocompromising conditions, with fever and cough as the most common symptoms. We also show that the majority of immunocompromised patients diagnosed with hMPV are subsequently admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, but that only 2% of those initially presenting with URTI symptoms go on to develop LRTI. However, there were no clear differences in the presentation of patients with URTI or LRTI in terms of age, symptoms (fever or cough), laboratory abnormalities, or underlying condition that would clearly identify risk factors for LRTI disease and guide decision-making. Interestingly, 2 of the 3 patient deaths were in patients with hMPV pneumonia diagnosed prior to HSCT. Both of these patients, however, had underlying diseases (aplastic anemia and SCID), which made it extremely unlikely that they would be able to clear their viral infection without reconstitution of their immune system through HSCT. These patients both underwent HSCT, and subsequently died of hMPV pneumonia despite use of ribavirin and IVIG and supportive care including mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. These 2 patients continued to have detectable virus within days of death.",

Pretransplant screening for RSV and delay of transplant in adults is effective in reducing rates of pneumonia [20]. Our policy in pediatric patients is to delay transplant if patients have evidence of infection with RSV, influenza, adenovirus, or hMPV, even if patients are asymptomatic. Transplantation is not generally delayed for asymptomatic shedding of rhinovirus, bocavirus, or coronavirus. This study further enforces the risks associated with transplantation during documented hMPV viral shedding or disease. Because infection may result in such serious disease, potential modalities to treat or at least stabilize patients while white blood cells and/or immune function can return are considered and utilized in these patients. Treatment with IVIG and ribavirin is currently being utilized at our institution for severely immunocompromised individuals [21, 22]. Among the patients who received treatment, we demonstrated a 22% mortality rate as compared to a 2% mortality rate in untreated individuals. This, however, is almost certainly a reflection of clinical decision-making to initiate treatment in individuals with more severe disease.",

We did not screen asymptomatic children and may not have captured complete data on children who were evaluated solely as outpatients at other private clinics or hospitalized in other institutions. As the regional pediatric referral center, most immunocompromised patients are seen and followed at our institution but because of our large geographic referral area, it is possible that some children were seen elsewhere. Therefore, our study could be biased towards detection of more severe hMPV disease. Also, it is possible that a subset of earlier hMPV-positive cases were missed through use of DFA as compared to PCR, a more sensitive detection technique [12]. Furthermore, we were unable to capture all data at the time of clinical presentation, or to obtain full information regarding the clinical decision-making for the administration of ribavirin and/or IVIG. Therefore, the comparison of outcomes in patients who did and did not receive treatment is problematic, and the potential benefits of therapy are not readily evaluable. Unlike a previous hMPV study conducted in adult HSCT recipient patients in Italy [23], we did not assess hMPV shedding in asymptomatic patients and unfortunately cannot comment on rates of symptomatic versus asymptomatic shedding of hMPV in our patients. Finally, we were limited in our ability to classify disease severity based on hypoxemia, as some patients did not have oxygen saturations charted. We suspect that a higher proportion of our patients would be classified as having severe disease using criteria such as that used by Papenburg et al [5]. Although only 8 (15%) of our patients were identified as having acquired their hMPV infection nosocomially, the vast majority of the patients were seen frequently on an outpatient basis in clinic for blood draws, interventions, and chemotherapy, making it difficult to differentiate true community-acquired disease from that acquired in the hospital setting.",
