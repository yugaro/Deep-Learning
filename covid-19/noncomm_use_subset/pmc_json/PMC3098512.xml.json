            "text": "Viruses use the host translational machinery to translate their own mRNA. As a consequence, their codon usage is under selective pressure to adapt to the host transfer RNA (tRNA) pool (Sharp and Li 1987). In RNA viruses in general and HIV-1 in particular, adaptation to the host is poor despite this selection (Bahir et al. 2009). For example, according to a recent compilation of tRNAs in human genome (Chan and Lowe 2009), the AUC codon can be translated by 17 tRNAIle species, that is, 14 tRNAIle/IAU, and 3 tRNAIle/GAU, AUU can be translated by 14 tRNAIle/IAU species, whereas AUA can be translated by 5 tRNAIle/UAU species only. In agreement with this, human genes code Ile mostly by AUC and least by AUA. In contrast, HIV-1 genes code Ile mostly by AUA and least by AUC (Haas et al. 1996; Nakamura et al. 2000). The poor codon adaptation of HIV-1 reduces the translation efficiency of HIV-1 genes. Modifying HIV-1 codon usage according to host codon usage has been shown to increase the production of viral proteins (Haas et al. 1996; Ngumbela et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Conventionally, the poor concordance between HIV-1 and host codon usage is explained by the mutation hypothesis invoking high A-biased mutation at the third codon position of HIV-1 genes (Jenkins and Holmes 2003). The A-bias is mediated by the error-prone reverse transcriptase (Martinez et al. 1994; Vartanian et al. 2002) and the human APOBEC3 protein (Yu et al. 2004). The frequency of A can reach up to 40% in some HIV-1 genomes (Vartanian et al. 2002), resulting in a preponderance of A-ending codons, which are typically rarely used in the host genes (Sharp 1986; Kypr and Mrazek 1987). Although there have been claims that the A-richness in a parasitic or symbiotic genome may confer some selective advantage (Xia 1996; Keating et al. 2009), further empirical substantiation is required. In short, although avoiding A-ending codons may improve translation elongation efficiency, A-biased mutations lead to an overrepresentation of A-ending codons in HIV-1 genes.",

HIV-1 is known to package host tRNAs, specifically tRNALys and tRNAIle (Jiang et al. 1993; Pavon-Eternod et al. 2010). tRNALys is used by HIV-1 as a primer to initiate reverse transcription (Jiang et al. 1993; Marquet et al. 1995; Kleiman and Cen 2004; Kleiman et al. 2004) and is selectively packaged by HIV-1, through the interaction of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) with Gag-Pol, Gag, and viral genomic RNA (Javanbakht et al. 2003; Kleiman et al. 2010). More specifically, Gag alone is capable of packaging LysRS, but the presence of Gag-Pol both enhances the packaging of LysRS and is needed to incorporate tRNALys (Mak et al. 1994; Khorchid et al. 2000; Javanbakht et al. 2003; Kleiman et al. 2010). However, both the function of tRNAIle and the mechanisms that lead to its incorporation into HIV-1 virions are unknown.",

Inexplicably, specific tRNA species were packaged within each codon family. For example, tRNAIle/UAU was highly packaged by HIV-1 as compared with tRNAIle/IAU. As aforementioned, the AUA codon read by tRNAIle/UAU is rarely used in human genes but is the most common codon for Ile in HIV-1. The authors therefore speculated that the incorporation of the rare tRNAIle/UAU could be related to the decoding of the unfavorable AUA codon in HIV-1 genes (Pavon-Eternod et al. 2010).",

This suggests that the tRNA pool for translating HIV-1 genes may be selectively altered to favor the translation of HIV-1 genes and that this altered tRNA pool is reflected in the tRNA packaged by HIV-1 virions. HIV-1 early genes were found to have similar codon usage as highly expressed host genes, but HIV-1 late genes do not. This is consistent with our interpretation that alterations to the tRNA pool occur late in infection and that HIV-1 early and late genes evolved different codon usage in response to their respective tRNA pools.",

Coding sequences were extracted, and the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was computed using DAMBE (Xia 2001; Xia and Xie 2001). RSCU is a normalized index of codon usage bias (Sharp and Li 1987). It has a value of zero for unused synonymous codons, a value of one for equally used synonymous codons and a maximum of n, where n is the number of synonymous codons in the codon family. Codon families read by only one codon (AUG for Met and UGG for Trp) always have a value of 1 and were therefore excluded from analyses. Stop codons were also excluded from RSCU analyses. Codon adaptation index or codon adaptive index (CAI) (Sharp and Li 1987) was computed by the improved implementation in DAMBE (Xia 2007), using the codon usage table of highly expressed human genes compiled in the file Ehuman.cut in the EMBOSS package (Rice et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Interestingly, in HTLV-1 that infects the same type of host cell as HIV-1, both early and late genes have their RSCU positively correlated with host RSCU, with similar slopes (fig. 3b). The positive correlation in RSCU between HTLV-1 and human genes is highly significant (Pearson r = 0.4982, P < 0.0001, Spearman r = 0.4688, P = 0.0002). Both HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are retroviruses with RNA genomes, but HTLV-1 is exceptional in that it does not have a strong A-biased mutation (van Hemert and Berkhout 1995; Van Dooren et al. 2004). HTLV-1 relies for the most part on the host polymerase to replicate through clonal expansion of infected cells rather than undergoing iterative replication cycles like HIV-1 (Strebel 2005). The substitution rate of HTLV-1 is consequently lower, about 5.2 \u00d7 10-6 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004; Van Dooren et al. 2004), whereas that of HIV-1 is around 2.5 \u00d7 10-3 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004). Thus, although HTLV-1 infects the same cells as HIV-1, that is, human CD4+ T cells (Rimsky et al. 1988) and both viruses are therefore subject to the same selective pressures on codon usage by the host tRNA pool, mutations are less likely to disrupt codon\u2013anticodon adaptation in HTLV-1 than in HIV-1 as they occur at a lower rate in the former. The contrast between HIV-1 and HTLV-1 codon usage (fig. 3) suggests that the difference in codon adaptation between HIV-1 early and late genes (fig. 3a) may be a derived feature evolved after the divergence of the HIV-SIV lineage from HTLV-1 in response to the high A-biased mutation disrupting codon adaptation in HIV-1 late genes that need to be mass translated to produce viral particles.",

As tRNAs that read A-ending codons are rare in human cells, their higher levels of packaging is surprising. It would be tempting to hypothesize that rare tRNAs are actively packaged and delivered into a newly infected cells to alter the tRNA pool. However, this hypothesis cannot be true for two reasons. First, reverse transcription and translation in HIV-1 are two spatially and temporally separate processes. Reverse transcription is completed early in the viral life cycle, soon after viral entry and uncoating, whereas viral translation occurs much later, particularly if the virus enters latency (Saksela et al. 1993). Second, the few tRNAs carried in a single HIV-virion (Huang et al. 1994; Halwani et al. 2004) would minimally affect the cellular tRNA pool and could therefore contribute little to the improvement of viral translation. We therefore suggest an alternative hypothesis. That is, the tRNA pool when HIV-1 late genes are translated is enriched with tRNAs decoding A-ending codons common in HIV-1 late genes. The packaging of tRNA into the HIV-1 virion is passive and reflects the relative tRNA abundance in the altered tRNA pool.",

Several empirical studies have shown that modifying HIV-1 codon usage according to the codon usage of highly expressed host genes can substantially increase the production of viral proteins of HIV-1 late genes (Haas et al. 1996; Ngumbela et al. 2008). However, these studies were conducted with the normal tRNA pool in the host cell and did not take into consideration of the possible alteration of the host tRNA pool during the translation of HIV-1 late genes.

That is, the HIV-1 early genes are translated in a tRNA pool when normal translation of host genes is still taking place, whereas the HIV-1 late genes are translated when the tRNA pool has been selectively enriched with tRNA species decoding A-ending codons in HIV-1 late genes. However, as one reviewer has pointed out, the difference in codon adaptation between early and late HIV-1 genes could also be due to a lower mutation rate in the early genes than in the late genes. This hypothesis is reasonable given that 1) A-biased mutation in HIV-1 disrupts codon\u2013anticodon adaptation and 2) HTLV-1 that infects the same type of host cells but has a lower mutation rate than HIV-1 has its protein-coding genes exhibiting better codon\u2013anticodon adaptation than those in HIV-1 (fig. 3b). Thus, differential mutation rate can plausibly result in different codon adaptation. If HIV-1 early genes have lower (A-biased) mutation rate than HIV-1 late genes, then we would expect the early genes to exhibit better codon adaptation than the late genes. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and both have the same prediction (i.e., the A-ending codons are less frequent in HIV-1 early genes than in HIV-1 late genes), but which one might play a more significant role?",

If A-biased mutation is stronger in the late genes than in the early genes, then A12 should be higher in the late genes than in the early genes. However, there is no significant differences in A12 between the early and the late genes, and A12 for the early tat gene (=0.3276) is in fact greater than A12 for two late genes vpr (=0.3144) and vpu (=0.3133).

Host cells react to infection via various responses if uninhibited by the virus. Though HIV-1 has been shown to block the innate anti-viral response (Goujon and Malim 2010), other stress responses such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) can induce shutdown of transcription of ribosomal RNAs as well as repression of translation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-2\u03b1 (DuRose et al. 2009). Translation of HIV-1 proteins is not inhibited by the repression of host proteins because HIV-1 messages can be translated by a cap-independent internal ribosome entry site-mediated mechanism (Yilmaz et al. 2006). Shutdown or drastic alteration of host protein and RNA expression would affect the tRNA pool, as demand for tRNAs for host proteins would be diminished. The UPR response is induced in response to the accumulation of highly expressed viral proteins, particularly the structural glycoproteins (Kaufman 2002) and has been demonstrated to be activated by numerous viruses, including hepatitis C (Chan and Egan 2009), severe acute respiratory syndrome (Minakshi et al. 2009), Japanese Encephalitis virus (Su et al. 2002), and Coxsackie B2 virus (Zhang et al. 2010). UPR responses are activated late in viral infections during translation of structural proteins, in agreement with the observed differences between early and late HIV-1 genes, suggesting that this host response might play a role in the alteration of the tRNA pool during HIV-1 infection.",

This second tRNA pool has been selectively enriched with tRNAs translating A-ending codons. The packaged tRNA in the virion is simply a reflection of the relative abundance of this second tRNA pool. The main difference between the two tRNA pools is that the second tRNA pool features relatively more tRNAs translating A-ending codons. Because the early genes are translated in the first tRNA pool with relatively few tRNA translating A-ending codons, they should avoid the use the A-ending codons (similar to human genes). In contrast, the HIV-1 late genes are translated in the second tRNA pool containing relatively more tRNAs decoding A-ending codons, the selection against using A-ending codons is weaker and these late genes have significantly more A-ending codons.",
