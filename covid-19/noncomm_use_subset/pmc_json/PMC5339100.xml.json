Both the NxTAG RPP and xTAG RVP FAST v2 have the same number of viral targets, including influenza A virus (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and A/H1N1/2009 strains), influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4 (PIV 1-4), enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. The NxTAG RPP has two additional atypical bacterial targets, namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Recent studies have compared the performance of the new NxTAG RPP with that of other respiratory panels such as the BioFire FilmArray RVP [34], RespiFinder-22 [5], Anyplex II RV16 [6], and xTAG RVP FAST v2 [7]. Overall, these reports demonstrated that the NxTAG RPP is at least comparable to, if not better than, some of the comparators. Here, we assessed the clinical performance of the NxTAG RPP versus the xTAG RVP FAST v2 in detecting respiratory viruses.",

Notably, the seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus was not detected in our local population, and was not included in this study. This strain appears to have been completely replaced by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus since 2009/2010 [8]. Overall, both assays showed comparable sensitivity and specificity for all viral targets, except for the influenza A/H3N2 virus. Notably, the xTAG RVP FAST v2 showed poor performance in influenza A/H3N2 subtyping, which may be due to primer mismatches. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has compared the performance of the NxTAG RPP with that of the xTAG RVP FAST v2; however, missed detection of influenza A/H3N2 was not reported [7]. It is unclear whether the missed detection by the xTAG RVP FAST v2 was related to the variant H3N2 virus reported by the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta) recently [910]. Nonetheless, the inability to simultaneously detect and subtype these H3N2 viruses is a major hindrance for clinical laboratories to return test results within established turn-around-time. The influenza A/H3N2 virus is a clinically significant respiratory pathogen. Therefore, the ability to rapidly provide subtype information is important during an outbreak or in epidemiologic investigations. By contrast, the influenza A/H3N2 primers in the NxTAG RPP have been updated to detect these untypable strains. Our study suggests that existing xTAG RVP FAST v2 users should switch to the NxTAG RPP, which has better sensitivity for influenza A/H3N2, without a significant drop in sensitivity for the other respiratory viral targets.",

However, the inability of both Luminex assays to distinguish enterovirus from rhinovirus infections in patients lowers their overall clinical utility. This distinction is clinically important, particularly for septic workups in neonates and other vulnerable/immunocompromised patients, as enteroviruses can disseminate to cause systemic infection and involve multiple organs, whereas rhinoviruses generally do not [11]. The RVP assay can detect multiple viral targets simultaneously. Our study revealed nine cases of co-infections. Most of the co-infections involved enterovirus/rhinovirus (78%), consistent with results of previous studies [1213], and 43% of these cases involved enterovirus/rhinovirus and RSV.",

However, the need to manipulate post-amplification products presents an inherent risk for laboratory contamination. Moreover, the need to remove the seal from the vessel during the detection presents another potential source of sample cross-contamination, leading to false-positives. Besides cross-contamination, high background noise (Fig. 1) is another source of false-positives, which is commonly associated with the Luminex bead-based suspension array technology due to suboptimal hybridization conditions involving temperature divergences or operator variations. In contrast, the NxTAG RPP is a closed-tube, one-step system, which abolishes the need for post-amplification product manipulation and removal of the seal. The hands-on time is significantly reduced with the simplified workflow, alleviating process variations and giving a turnaround time of <4 hr for 48 samples. Overall, the streamlined workflow minimizes cross-contamination and background noise. However, initially, where the extracted nucleic acid is used to resuspend the preplated lyophilized bead reagents, the repeat pipetting can cause possible cross-over contamination. Finally, the NxTAG RPP can process between 1 and 96 samples per run, without wasting additional consumables or reagents. This flexible throughput can cater to the needs of laboratories with different and/or variable volume demands.",
