            "text": "In the 21st century, various infectious diseases threaten humans and animals around the world due to ever-increasing global movements of people, animals, and materials [1923]. Nonetheless, the most effective way of approaching an epidemic that occurs at unexpected times and or in unexpected places is to rapidly supply vaccines related to the infectious diseases within a limited time [15]. However, during rapid vaccine developments performed to date, there has been little consideration given to establishing a precise protocol for ensuring brain safety. This oversight in the development of general and/or emergent vaccines should be corrected by developing an effective safety protocol that can reduce brain damage risks before distribution of the vaccine. The present study was undertaken to establish a protocol that can be used to determine if a material, such as a vaccine, will damage the brain by breaking down the brain-protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). Since the BBB is a critical morphological structure with selective permeability between blood vessels and brain tissue, it is very important to determine the conditions that can make the BBB vulnerable; for example, exposure to a pyrogenic inflammatory agent such as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered via systemic injection [10]. To ensure the brain safety of newly developed vaccines and to establish positive-control conditions for use in a vaccine safety protocol, we used the specificity of brain anatomical structures to investigate the robustness of the BBB by varying LPS exposure times (0, 2, 4, and 24 h) in two different mouse strains (C57BL/6 and ICR). In this study, we describe an effective positive-control protocol for assessing the brain safety of vaccines that will be developed and supplied in the future. The protocol may develop into a complete safety assurance protocol in the future.",

The mice were divided into 8 groups (n = 4) based on mouse strain and LPS exposure time: group 1, B6/0 h; group 2, B6/2 h; group 3, B6/4 h; group 4, B6/24 h; group 5, ICR/0 h; group 6, ICR/2 h; group 7, ICR/4 h; and group 8, ICR/24 h. The LPS solution was i.p. injected into all mice simultaneously and each group of mice was sacrificed at the planned LPS PI time. After euthanasia, the brain was removed from each mouse and was cut into two hemispheres. RNA was extracted from one hemisphere by using Trizol reagent (Ambion; Life Technologies, USA) and protein was extracted from the other hemisphere by using PRO-PREP (iNtRon Biotechnology, Korea) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Briefly, for RNA extraction, the homogenized hemisphere was incubated in Trizol and chloroform reagent and then subjected to centrifugation. The aqueous phase was removed and incubated with 100% isopropanol. After centrifugation, the obtained RNA pellet was washed with 75% ice-cold ethanol and then dissolved in RNase-free water. The obtained RNA extract solution was stored at \u221270\u2103 after undergoing 60\u2103 heat incubation. For protein extraction, the homogenized hemisphere of each mouse was incubated in PRO-PREP solution and centrifuged several times under ice-cold conditions. The refined protein extract solution was stored at \u221220\u2103.",

Nutrients and oxygen in the bloodstream can permeate endothelial cells into the basal lamina through a variety of transport routes [9]. These endothelial cells are layered and form a barrier by their close proximity to each other and by tight junctions (TJs) located on cell membranes [313]. TJs such as occludin, claudin, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) and zonula occludens (ZO) are key structures of the BBB and significantly reduce permeation of some macromolecular and toxic solutes [1122]. Therefore, disruption of TJs leads to barrier disruption. Many previous reports have shown that LPS, a toxin from bacteria, combines with the toll-like receptor on the endothelial cell membrane to stimulate inflammation via signals from various cytokines including nuclear factor kappa B, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 [26121820]. Under excessive inflammatory conditions, these cytokines can break down TJs, particularly occludin, which is sensitive to cytokines [624]. Therefore, we thought it prudent to establish a positive-control protocol that involved injecting an appropriate dose of LPS to an animal model and observing the resultant damage to occludin and ZO-1 TJs.",

In that assay, EB penetrates into brain parenchymal tissues and an EB ratio (brain/blood EB content) is calculated. A high permeated EB ratio indicates a significantly damaged BBB structure. We used LPS from two sources (S. enterica and E. coli) and two strains of mice (B6 and ICR mice). Interestingly, the results from each LPS and mouse strain showed different trends. The BBB protective permeability of ICR mice was more intensely impaired than that of B6 mice, and LPS derived from S. enterica penetrated the brain more effectively than that derived from E. coli. It has been reported that LPS consists of three different structures; O-antigen, core polysaccharide, and lipid A. In particular, the composition of the O-chain varies notably from strain to strain and the O-chain is a recognizable target of host antibodies, as O-antigen. Therefore, it is possible that LPSs of different bacterial origins can produce different degrees of BBB permeability damage. As the purpose of this study was to establish an effective BBB safety verification positive-control protocol, we selected the LPS type that had the highest damage effect on BBB permeability. In addition, the EB results from the two mouse strains showed that a more sensitive positive-control protocol could be established by using ICR mice instead of B6 mice.",

Meanwhile, occludin mRNA level was only significantly increased at 24 h PI. In common with the mRNA results, ZO-1 and occludin protein expressions significantly increased over time in the ICR mice but not in the B6 mice. Interestingly, while ZO-1 mRNA level was downregulated at 24 h PI, ZO-1 protein expression progressively increased. It is thought that this difference is related to the time required to synthesize proteins from mRNAs during the recovery process after TJ impairment. Similar to the ZO-1 results, occludin protein expression also showed an upward tendency at 24 h PI. Even though some previous in vitro studies have shown that TJ mRNA and protein levels decrease after LPS injection [2125], a compensatory mechanism could not be generally achieved in vitro than in vivo. In other words, even though the BBB structures were destroyed and its function was impaired, it could not be recovered in vitro system in plastic plate or flask, because there are no other kinds of cells or tissues which counteract and cooperate with epithelial cells with TJs. However, in vivo system, the compensatory reaction in the body could be activated by various cells and tissues for healing of impaired region. Therefore, we believe that the expressions of TJ-related mRNAs and proteins continuously increase until TJ structure and function are restored through physiological processes in animal models. In this study, B6 mice showed lower BBB penetrance of EB dye than that in ICR mice; moreover, in both mouse strains, the mRNA and protein expression results from both mice strains generally corresponded with EB assay results.",

It appears that diverse cytokines produced in cytoplasm after LPS injection can break down the intracellular linkage between occludin and ZO-1. Damaged occludin and ZO-1 proteins are degraded by proteasomes and a recovery pathway is needed. In endothelial cells of the BBB in ICR mice, the impairment and recovery routes for occludin and ZO-1 might be time-consuming. As mentioned, the TJ molecular structure or the inflammatory and recovery pathways of BBB in B6 mice might be different from those in ICR mice. Considering the EB assay results demonstrating the disruption of TJs in BBB, we suggest two possibilities for the differences between B6 and ICR mice. First, impairment of ZO-1 and occludin protein of B6 mice might be less caused than those of ICR mice by an inflammatory activity suppressed by an unknown factor. Second, the structure and function of ZO-1 and occludin in B6 mice are recovered after 24 h PI. However, the hypothesis that there might be unknown factors in B6 mice which protects TJs from being destroyed by LPS or it requires time longer than 24 h to be destroyed and/or recovered should be investigated through further study.",

While ZO-1 mRNA levels in ICR BBB increased until 4 h PI and decreased until 24 h PI, the ZO-1 protein expression was continuously increased until 24 h PI. This time lag is thought to be caused by the process requirements for protein synthesis from mRNA and by the protein expression regulatory activity of the biological mechanism within brain epithelial cells. The expression of occludin mRNA and protein were rather more slowly increased than those of ZO-1. The location of proteins and accessibility of proteasomes for occludin as a transmembrane protein and for ZO-1 as an intracellular protein might be factors in the temporal differences between the two TJ proteins.",

We conclude that the ICR mouse strain is suitable for use in the protocol with TJ disruption of the BBB assessed after 4 h of exposure following systemic LPS administration at a dosage of 1 mg LPS(S) in 4 mL PBS per kilogram body weight. By comparing the TJ mRNA levels at 4 h PI between the LPS-injected group and the selected vaccine-injected group, it is possible to surmise the potential danger of damage to the BBB structure of the tested vaccine. For example, if TJ mRNA levels of vaccine-injected group are significantly higher than those of the LPS-injected group 4 h after injection, one should consider the vaccine to be unsafe to BBB structure or function at the injected concentration. Further testing may be done at other concentrations.",
