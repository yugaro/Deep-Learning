The ER quality control mechanism assures that functionally incompetent, misfolded, or unassembled oligomeric proteins are retained and targeted for proteolysis via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Hurtley and Helnius 1989; Brodsky and McCracken 1997; Bonifacino and Weismann 1998; Ellgaard et al. 1999; Wickner et al. 1999). The ERAD involves the recognition, dislocation, and proteolysis of misfolded polypeptides by the 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic enzyme complex localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Baumeister et al. 1998; Bonifacino and Weismann 1998; Brodsky and McCracken 1999; Plemper and Wolf 1999). The ATP-dependent cleavage process is facilitated by multiple ubiquitin attachments to the \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues of the substrate and catalyzed by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving ubiquitin-activating (E1) and -conjugating (E2) enzymes in addition to ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3) (Hershko and Ciechanover 1998).",

            "text": "Trafficking defects have been recognized as the underlying mechanism in a growing number of genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), diabetes insipidus, and \u03b11 antitrypsin deficiency (Thomas et al. 1995; Bonifacino and Weismann 1998; Hershko and Ciechanover 1998; Aridor and Balch 1999; Kopito 1999; Schwartz and Ciechanover 1999). CF, the most prevalent recessive genetic disorder in the caucasian population, is caused by the dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transport protein family (Riordan et al. 1989; Rommens et al. 1989). CFTR is a cAMP-stimulated Cl\u2212 channel, residing predominantly at the cell surface and, less abundantly, in the endosomal compartment (Bradbury 1999). The channel consists of two homologous halves, each comprised of six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), which are connected by the regulatory domain (Riordan et al. 1989). This complex, multidomain structure conceivably renders the posttranslational folding of wild-type (wt) CFTR inefficient. Approximately 70% of the newly synthesized wt CFTR is trapped in the ER as core-glycosylated folding intermediate (apparent molecular weight \u223c150, 000) and degraded with a t\n1/2 of \u223c30 min by the ERAD. Proteasome activity is responsible, at least in part, for the degradation of the co- and posttranslationally ubiquitinated and incompletely folded CFTR at the ER (Jensen et al. 1995; Ward et al. 1995; Xiong et al. 1999). However, inhibition of proteasomes has failed to promote the processing of core-glycosylated wt as well as the \u0394F508 CFTR (Jensen et al. 1995; Ward et al. 1995).",

Processing of the high mannose type N-linked glycan to complex type oligosaccharides in the cis/medial Golgi region is reflected by a decreased electrophoretic mobility (\u223c180 kD), providing a convenient method to monitor the trafficking of the CFTR (Cheng et al. 1990; Lukacs et al. 1994; Ward and Kopito 1994; Riordan 1999). Not only does the folded complex-glycosylated CFTR have a slow turnover in vivo (t\n1/2 > 12 h), but it also displays a conformation which is more resistant to proteolysis in vitro (Zhang et al. 1998). The posttranslational folding or conformational maturation of CFTR is independent of ER to Golgi vesicular transport, implying that complex glycosylation is not a prerequisite to attain the native conformation (Lukacs et al. 1994; Ward and Kopito 1994; Zhang et al. 1998).",

Recently, we have identified a mechanistically distinct category of mutation, caused by premature terminations and frameshift mutations in the CF gene (Haardt et al. 1999). Although the ER processing of these COOH-terminally truncated CFTR variants missing their last 70\u201382 amino acid residues (T70 and T82 CFTR) is similar to that of the wt form, the biological half-life of the complex-glycosylated mutants is sixfold shorter than their wt counterpart (Haardt et al. 1999). Although the proteolytic elimination mechanism of the processing mutants entrapped in the ER has been extensively studied (Welsh and Smith 1993; Kopito 1999; Riordan 1999), the cellular processes responsible for the short residence time of the truncated CFTR in post-Golgi compartments remained obscure.",

Structural destabilization, demonstrated by increased protease susceptibility in vitro and diminished thermostability of the complex-glycosylated mutants in vivo, may serve as signal for premature proteolysis. In contrast, lysosomal proteolysis appears to represent the rate-limiting step in the degradation of the complex-glycosylated wt CFTR. These results reveal a novel aspect of the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway in the elimination of nonnative CFTR after its escape from the ER quality control.",

In contrast, deletion of the last 26 amino acid residues (T26 CFTR) was without effect (Mickle et al. 1998; Haardt et al. 1999). It was also shown that neither the translational rate nor the biosynthetic maturation of the T70 and T82 CFTR was significantly impaired at the ER in transient COS-1 (Haardt et al. 1999) or in stable BHK expression systems (Benharouga, M., and G.L. Lukacs, unpublished data). We proposed that, in contrast to the most prevalent CF-associated processing mutations (e.g., \u0394F508 CFTR), which compromise the biogenesis of CFTR, destabilization of the mature form at distal stages of the biosynthetic or endocytic pathway accounts for the phenotypic manifestation of truncated CFTR (Haardt et al. 1999).",

Similar results were obtained in lysosomes isolated by the calcium-precipitation method (data not shown; Kawashima et al. 1998). Surprisingly, leupeptin and pepstatin A provoked the accumulation of degradation intermediates of both wt and T70 CFTR predominantly in lysosomes (Fig. 3 B). These inhibitors also provoked the appearance of breakdown products in isolated lysosomes of intestinal epithelia (CaCo-2 and T84) expressing CFTR endogenously, implying that lysosomal proteolysis cannot be attributed to heterologous overexpession (data not shown). Considering that cathepsin inhibitors are unable to promote the ER processing of the core-glycosylated form (Lukacs et al. 1994; Ward and Kopito 1994), our results suggest that endolysosomal proteases are essential for the elimination of the complex-glycosylated full-length wt CFTR.

MG132 exerted a less pronounced effect (Fig. 4 B). Comparable inhibition was observed when lactacystin was added after the pulse labeling (Fig. 4 C) or after a 2-h chase (Fig. 4 D). This latter protocol has ensured that augmented conversion of the core- to the complex-glycosylated form was not attributable to the lactacystin effect. Similarly, preventing ER to Golgi complex transport of the residual core-glycosylated T70 CFTR with brefeldin A (BFA) failed to influence the inhibitory effect of lactacystin (Fig. 4 D), substantiating the notion that disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutants is delayed, rather than that the escape of core-glycosylated form is facilitated, by lactacystin. In fact, neither lactacystin nor MG 132 promoted the processing of the core-glycosylated T70 CFTR (Fig. 5 A), similarly to other CFTR mutations identified in NBD1 (Jensen et al. 1995; Van Oene et al. 2000).

The turnover of the folded core-glycosylated T70 CFTR was fourfold slower (t\n1/2 \u223c 7 h) than that of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR (t\n1/2 \u223c 1.8 h; Fig. 4 F).

As we anticipated, proteasome inhibitors mitigated the disappearance of Tac-TCR\u03b1, but not Tac-Lamp1, whereas bafilomycin B, but not the proteasome inhibitors, stabilized Tac-Lamp1 (Fig. 5B and Fig. C). Consistent with the notion that proteasome activity accounts, at least in part, for the proteolysis of the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR, proteasome inhibitors increased the steady state level of the complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR by two- to fourfold according to densitometric analysis of immunoblots (Fig. 5 D). This was also reflected by the elevated cAMP-activated anion conductance of the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 E).

COS-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding for the wt or T70 CFTR and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub). HA-Ub was detected with the monoclonal anti-HA Ab in immunoprecipitated T70 CFTR. The abundance of high molecular weight immunoreactive polypeptides was augmented by lactacystin and MG132, suggesting that proteasome activity is involved in the degradation of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR (Fig. 7 A, top, lanes 8\u201310). Similar results were obtained by monitoring the conjugation of endogenous Ub with a monoclonal anti-Ub Ab (Fig. 7 A, middle, lanes 6\u201310). Ubiquitinated T70 CFTR could not be detected in cells expressing T70 CFTR or HA-Ub individually (Fig. 7 A, top, lanes 3\u20137) or after mock transfection (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1\u20133), validating the specificity of the assay. To discriminate whether polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR was derived from the core- and/or the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR (Jensen et al. 1995; Ward et al. 1995; Xiong et al. 1999), double immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled T70 CFTR was performed.",

In a second set of samples, separation of ubiquitinated adducts was achieved by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR and then with anti-Ub Ab. The results show that a negligible amount of polyubiquitinated and core-glycosylated T70 CFTR persisted after the initial 2-h chase (Fig. 7 B, top and bottom, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, radioactivity appeared in the high molecular weight, polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR when MG132 was present during the last 2 h of chase (Fig. 7 B, top, lane 4). Accumulation of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR was more pronounced in COS-1 cells transiently coexpressing T70 CFTR and HA-Ub (Fig. 7 C). This is most likely due to the higher immunoprecipitation efficiency of the anti-HA Ab. Ubiquitinated conjugates were not detectable upon inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis, or in mock transfected cells (Fig. 7 B, top and middle, and C). Considering that the turnover of the complex-glycosylated, but not the core-glycosylated T70 CFTR, is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors and the core-glycosylated form has been largely eliminated before proteasome inhibition, we conclude that at least a fraction of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR originates from the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. Although we cannot rule out that a small amount of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR is derived from the core-glycosylated form, the following observations substantiate the notion that the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR can form ubiquitinated adducts. Ubiquitinated complex-glycosylated form was visualized by anti-Ub Abs after the separation of the core- and complex-glycosylated forms by immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR Abs and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of the dominant negative K48RUb with T70 CFTR delayed the disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutant CFTR (data not shown).",

Nevertheless, several examples demonstrate that the fidelity of the ER quality control is far from perfect. Nonfunctional polypeptides can escape ER retention, whereas mutants with partially or fully preserved biological function are being trapped, causing severe human diseases such as CF and alpha 1\u2013protease inhibitor deficiency (Thomas et al. 1995; Zielenski and Tsui 1995; Aridor and Balch 1999; Schwartz and Ciechanover 1999). Nonnative polypeptides could also be generated in post-ER compartments as a result of unfolding upon environmental stresses or mutations that compromise the native form stability (Goldenberg 1992; Pacifici et al. 1993; Parsell and Lindquist 1993; Sitte et al. 1998).

A post-ER quality control mechanism appears to be responsible for targeting and vacuolar degradation of mutant plasma membrane ATPase, the late Golgi protease Kex2, and a model protein, comprising the secretory invertase and the NH2 terminus of the lambda repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wilcox et al. 1992; Chang and Fink 1995; Hong et al. 1996). Aggregation of unoccupied class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and cross-linking of cell surface membrane proteins, such as the transferrin receptor, can evoke preferential lysosomal targeting and degradation (Weissman et al. 1986; Amigorena et al. 1995).

First, the degradation rates of the complex-glycosylated T70, 82, and 98 CFTR were delayed in the presence of lactacystin, the most specific inhibitor of proteasome (Fenteany et al. 1995; Fig. 4). Second, a dramatic extension of the plasma membrane residence time of biotinylated T70 CFTR was evoked by lactacystin (Fig. 6), implying that proteasomes are indispensable in the proteolysis of the truncated CFTR from the cell surface and/or endosomal compartment. Since proteasome inhibitors had no impact on the degradation of Tac-Lamp1, an indirect effect of lactacystin on lysosomal proteolysis could be precluded (Fig. 5). Third, MG132 and lactacystin evoked the accumulation of polyubiqutinated adducts of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR, consistent with the notion that a fraction of the T70 CFTR is tagged by polyubiquitin chain(s) before degradation (Fig. 7). Finally, both MG132 and lactacystin partially restored the expression level of complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR, as well as the plasma membrane cAMP-activated chloride conductance of T70 CFTR transfectants without facilitating the biogenesis of the mutants (Fig. 5D and Fig. E). Although these observations indicate that proteasome activity is one of the rate-limiting steps for the turnover of the full-length complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR, proteasome inhibitors failed to restore the mutant stability to that of the wt CFTR. This could be explained by incomplete inhibition of proteasome activity and/or the involvement of other, presently unidentified proteolytic mechanisms.",

A similar paradigm was proposed for the accelerated degradation of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor upon preventing its binding to EBP-50 (Cao et al. 1999). However, this possibility appears to be unlikely, since the steady state expression level and turnover rate of a CFTR variant lacking the COOH-terminal 26 amino acid residues are normal (Mickle et al. 1998; Haardt et al. 1999). Neither can aggregation of T70 CFTR at the trans-Golgi or at early endosomes target the mutant for lysosomal degradation. Finally, the absence of the COOH-terminal tail may structurally destabilize the folded CFTR, increasing the portion of nonnative molecules that are susceptible to proteolysis.",

            "text": "Evidence suggests that nonnative states of soluble polypeptides induced by mutations or thermal or chemical denaturation can lead to accelerated degradation (Parsell and Lindquist 1993; Hershko and Ciechanover 1998; Brodsky and McCracken 1999; Plemper and Wolf 1999), a paradigm that may apply to the degradation of nonnative plasma membrane proteins, including the truncated CFTR, as well. Based on the enhanced protease susceptibility and the decreased in vivo thermostability of T70 CFTR (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9), we speculate that structural destabilization of the native form is induced by disrupting interaction(s) of the COOH terminus. Using various yeast screening assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the Deg-1 proteolytic motif in the MAT\u03b12 transcription factor, it has been established that ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc6 and Ubc7) can recognize hydrophobic stretches and exposed hydrophobic surfaces on amphipathic helices (Sadis et al. 1995; Gilon et al. 1998; Johnson et al. 1998). These or similar motifs, normally buried inside the globular domains of CFTR or inserted into the membrane plane, may serve as recognition signal(s). In support of this notion, the decreased plasma membrane residence time and impaired expression level of the \u03b22- and the \u03b12A-adrenergic receptors were also attributed to structural destabilization (Gether et al. 1997; Wilson and Limbird 2000). However, the mechanism responsible for the downregulation of these G protein\u2013coupled receptors, which could be partially rescued with ligand stabilization, has remained obscure.",

            "text": "A key question that remains to be resolved is whether ubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasome-dependent degradation of the mutant CFTR from the cell surface or endosomal compartment. Several tyrosine kinase and G protein\u2013coupled receptors have been observed to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination and downregulation via lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation (Bonifacino and Weismann 1998; Hershko and Ciechanover 1998; Hicke 1999; Strous and Govers 1999). Ubiquitination also appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce the internalization and downregulation of plasma membrane receptors and transporters (e.g., FUR4, GAP1, STE2, STE3, and STE6) via vacuolar proteolysis in yeast (Hicke 1999). The constitutive downregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in association with the Nedd4 ubiquitin-ligase, was proposed to follow a similar degradation route, in contrast to the unassembled subunits of the channel, which were degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism at the ER (Staub et al. 1997).",

On the other hand, in light of multiple tyrosine- and dileucine-based endocytic signals in CFTR, ubiquitin attachment may not be a prerequisite for endocytosis (Lukacs et al. 1997; Prince et al. 1999; Hu et al. 2001). Consistent with the dispensable nature of ubiquitination, downregulation of the \u03b22-adrenergic and mutant m2-muscarinic receptors can proceed without endocytosis, presumably by direct association with proteasome and/or other, presently unidentified proteases (Jockers et al. 1999; Wilson and Limbird 2000). The recognition that both 26S proteasome and P700 subunit are able to degrade nonnative polypeptides lacking polyubiquitin conjugates supports the notion that a ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism cannot be ruled out (Murakami 1992; Braun et al. 1999; Sheaff et al. 2000; Strickland et al. 2000). Importantly, these degradation pathways are not mutually exclusive and may function in parallel.",

Degradation appears to be initiated by the unfolding of cytosolic domains in a proteasome-dependent manner. The biochemical as well as functional rescue of cell surface resident T70, but not wt CFTR (data not shown), by proteasome inhibitors substantiate this hypothesis. Whereas the initial cleavage of the mature wt CFTR, as opposed to mutant, relies on the activity of lysosmal proteases, subsequent degradation of wt and T70 CFTR converges in endolysosomes, demonstrated by their overlapping proteolytic fragmentation pattern in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors (Fig. 3 B).",
