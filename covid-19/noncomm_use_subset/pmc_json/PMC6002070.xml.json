            "text": "Developing tools for stable parameter estimation and reliable forecasting of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease epidemics represents a key priority for public health officials and government agencies in their work to prevent and mitigate disease threats. At the early stage of an outbreak, when incidence data are limited and subject to reporting delays, it is often premature to characterize the transition rates of individuals between various disease epidemiological compartments using, for instance, SEIR-type systems of differential equations, which may involve a substantial number of unknown parameters. For the early transmission period, phenomenological models of a logistic type, describing the progression of the epidemic in terms of the cumulative number of reported cases, C, provide a simple alternative. In what follows, we employ the generalized Richards model (Chowell et al., 2016, Smirnova et al., 2017, Turner et al., 1976)(1.1)dCdt=rCp[1\u2212(CK)a],CK(\u03c4)=(pa+p)1a,\u03c4\u2208(0,T),to estimate crucial disease parameters, such as the intrinsic growth rate (r), the deceleration of growth (p), the final size of the epidemic (K), the disease turning point (\u03c4), and the extent of deviation from the S-shaped dynamics of the classical logistic-growth curve (a), see Fig. 1. In (1.1), T is the duration of the outbreak.",

However, the statistical analysis of the fitting accuracy for the original and generalized Richards models indicates that the generalized Richards model outperforms its original version for epidemics characterized by an early sub-exponential growth phase (Chowell et al., 2016). For such outbreaks, the value of parameter p in (1.1) is less than 1 (0<p<1), and the reduction in the residual sum of squares appears to be statistically significant. Several mechanisms could give rise to initial sub-exponential growth in case incidence including (Chowell et al., 2015, Viboud et al., 2015): (i) spatially clustered contact structures (e.g., high clustering levels) (Chowell et al., 2015, Szendroi and Csanyi, 2004); (ii) early onset of population behavioral changes and control interventions (Chowell et al., 2015, Szendroi and Csanyi, 2004); and (iii) substantial heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity of the host population that introduces high local variability in the local reproduction number that fluctuates around the epidemic threshold at 1.0. The two limiting cases of the generalized Richards model are those in which p=0 (constant incidence growth) or p=1 (exponential growth) (Viboud et al., 2015).",

The most common a priori information is the one that uses our best guess on the potential values of q.

Specifically, since \u03c4 has the meaning of the disease turning point, its value should be about one or two orders of magnitude larger than b, p, and a. This suggests that, as we introduce a priori information, parameters b, p, and a must be appropriately weighted to balance the sensitivity of our model to all four unknowns.

If one solves (2.7) by a classical Gauss-Newton method and drives \u03b1 to 0 as iterations progress, then one gets what is known as iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton (IRGN) scheme (Bakushinsky, 1993, Bakushinsky and Kokurin, 2005)(3.1)[\u03a6\u2032*(qk)\u03a6\u2032(qk)+\u03b1kL*L]pk=\u2212[\u03a6\u2032*(qk)(\u03a6(qk)\u2212D)+\u03b1kL*L(qk\u2212q\u02dc)],qk+1=qk+\u03bbkpk,\u03bbk>0,where \u03a6\u2032*(q) is the adjoint to \u03a6\u2032(q).

To that end, we investigate the trajectories of the 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (World Health Organization, 2016). For illustration, we use early incident reported data to estimate the values of five unknown parameters, r, \u03c4, p, a, and K, by solving the regularized least squares problem with the RIRGN method (3.4). Then we substitute the estimated parameters into (1.1) to find the approximate values of future incident cases using the built-in Matlab ode23s solver. The data for this numerical experiment have been retrieved in 2015 from the World Health Organization (WHO) web site. The weekly series of cases were directly obtained from the WHO patient database.",

On the other hand, over-regularization may slow down the convergence of the iterative sequence {qk}, and result in unnecessary loss of precision. In our experiment, we take \u03b1\u02dc0=5\u22c510\u22124 for Sierra Leone and Liberia and \u03b1\u02dc0=10\u22123 for Guinea, where the data are more noise contaminated.

An alternative is to employ analytic results from asymptotic theory to estimate parameter uncertainty (Banks, Davidian, Samuels, & Sutton, 2009).

On the other hand, the Liberia outbreak, which is 45 weeks total, can be projected from as little as 12 weeks of early data. This inverse modeling approach could be adapted to analyze outbreaks of other disease system, e.g., avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Zika.
