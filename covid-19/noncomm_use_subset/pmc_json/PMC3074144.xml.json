PRF signals stochastically redirect ribosomes into new reading frames and viral PRF promotes synthesis of C-terminally extended fusion proteins. The most well defined PRF signals direct ribosomes to slip by one nucleotide in the 5\u2032 (\u22121) direction. \u22121 PRF signals typically contain three elements: a \u2018slippery site\u2019 composed of seven nucleotides (X XXY YYZ, incoming zero-frame indicated by spaces) where shifting occurs; a short spacer sequence and a downstream stimulatory structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot (1\u20133). Current models posit that the pseudoknot directs ribosomes to pause with their aminoacyl- (aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs positioned over the slippery sequence, where re-pairing of the non-wobble bases of both tRNAs with the \u22121 frame codons occurs (4\u20137).",

While the methodologies of each study covered a broad range of bioinformatics techniques, the general goal with the exceptions of (9,15) was to first find out-of-frame ORFs followed by the identification of PRF signals in the overlapping region between them. While this can identify new classes of PRF signals, it is based on the assumption that PRF outcomes should mimic those observed in viral genomes and thus cannot identify new operational outcomes of frameshifting.",

The seminal study in this field searched the yeast genome for operational \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 RF) promoting motifs resembling well characterized examples of viral \u22121 RF signals, identifying \u223c260 putative such elements (9). This work was limited by incomplete annotation of the yeast genome and insufficient computational resources available at the time. New bioinformatics tools were subsequently developed and applied using faster and more robust computational platforms. The results showed that: pattern matching approaches coupled with a predictive method for folding RNA sequences provided a dramatic improvement in the results; \u22121 RF motifs are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and many have predicted secondary structures with statistically significant measures of free energy (15). This analysis showed that \u223c11% of yeast genes contain at least one high probability \u22121 RF signal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nine putative \u22121 RF signals selected from a variety of S. cerevisiae genes/genome promoted efficient recoding in vivo. More recently, this bioinformatics protocol has been applied to additional genomes. Currently, more than 25 genomes have been analyzed and it appears that 8\u201312% of genes contain at least one potential \u22121 RF signal (see PRFdB at http://prfdb.umd.edu/) (17).",

            "text": "A key finding was that the outcome and function of \u22121 RF differs significantly between the viral and \u2018cellular\u2019 contexts. In viruses, PRF controls the stoichiometries of structural versus enzymatic proteins (18). In contrast, \u2018cellular\u2019 RF events redirect elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons, suggesting that \u22121 RF is used to control cellular mRNA abundance and stability through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. While PRF is required for the production of functional products, in the cellular context RF appears to operate in a different manner. Thus, in the current work, PRF is used to connote frameshift signals whose function is to produce C-terminally extended proteins with novel functions, while RF is used to refer to frameshift signals that operate to direct ribosomes to premature termination codons. A proof-of-principle experiment demonstrated that a viral \u22121 PRF signal can function as an mRNA destabilizing element and that mRNA destabilization required NMD (19). Here, rapid degradation of a reporter mRNA through NMD is demonstrated for four cellular yeast \u22121 RF signals. Further, genetic evidence suggests that the presence of the RF-stimulating pseudoknot may promote mRNA destabilization through the no-go decay (NGD) pathway (20). The EST2 gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase (21), was used to delve deeper into the relationships between \u22121 RF and mRNA stability. The EST2 mRNA is destabilized by \u22121 RF primarily via NMD. Ablation of its five \u22121 RF signals resulted in stabilization of the EST2 mRNA, and an inverse correlation between \u22121 RF efficiency and EST2 mRNA steady-steady state abundance was observed.",

The slippery heptamers for these \u22121 RF signals begin at nucleotides 858, 1653, 279 and 1521 of their respective ORFs. These were cloned into a yeast PGK1 reporter gene so that frameshifted ribosomes are directed to PTCs. All inserts were flanked by sequences derived from Renilla and firefly luciferase genes, providing unique exogenous sequences for specific detection of the reporter mRNAs. Two additional PGK1 reporters without \u22121 RF signals were used as controls: a readthrough reporter encoded a continuous ORF, while a PTC control contained an in-frame UAA termination codon (Figure 1). Reporters were introduced into wild-type yeast cells; their steady state mRNA abundances were determined by RNA blot analysis and normalized to U3 snoRNA controls (Figure 2). A minimum of three independent blots were performed for all experiments. We note that the blots shown in Figure 2 are simplified for the purpose of publication and that the strains are not all isogenic with one another. In contrast, the bar graphs shown in Figure 2 represent data summarized from multiple blots using isogenic strains.\n\n",

            "text": "In wild-type cells, all four of the cellular \u22121 RF signals and the in-frame PTC containing control were less abundant than the PGK1 reporter mRNA (Figure 2A). The decrease in mRNA steady-state abundance varied from \u223c100-fold of the readthrough control (EST2) to \u223c0.19-fold of wild-type (TBF1). Experiments were also performed in upf1\u0394 and dom34\u0394 strains, and the U3 snoRNA-normalized signal intensities were compared among the same signals between wild-type and mutant strains to determine the relative contributions of NMD and NGD on steady-state abundance of the \u22121 RF signal-containing reporters (Figure 2B and C). The PTC containing mRNA was only affected through the NMD pathway: 28-fold increased abundance in upf1\u0394 cells relative to wild-type cells, but no change in dom34\u0394 cells. The TBF1 \u22121 RF signal similarly affected the reporter signal only through NMD (\u223c4-fold). In contrast, the steady-state abundance of the EST2 and BUB3 \u22121 RF signal-containing reporter mRNAs were increased in both the upf1\u0394 and dom34\u0394 mutants: the EST2 signal was 35-fold less effective in decreasing mRNA abundance in upf1\u0394 cells when compared to the WT strain and \u223c14-fold less effective in dom34\u0394 cells, while the values for the BUB3 signal were \u223c7-fold and 8-fold, respectively. The steady-state abundance of the SPR6 \u22121 RF signal containing reporter mRNA was primarily increased in dom34\u0394 cells (\u223c2.0-fold). Deletion of DCP1, XRN1 and SKI3, all of which function downstream of UPF1 or DOM34, also generally increased the abundance of the reporter mRNAs (Figure 2D\u2013F). We note however that, in the case of the dcp1\u0394 cells, the reporter mRNAs were relatively abundant, most likely because of the presence of the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the exosome, and/or due to decapping activity contributed by other factors, e.g. by the presence of the L-A virus (29). These results establish that endogenous cellular \u22121 RF signals can decrease mRNA steady-state abundance in yeast through the NMD pathway. In addition, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of these signals may also affect mRNA abundance through NGD, although substantiation of this claim requires further studies, e.g. to monitor the abundance of the endonucleolytic cleavage products and mRNA stability assays in NGD\u2212 strains.",

            "text": "Figure 2 suggests that \u22121 RF induced NMD is the major cause of decreased mRNA steady-state abundance by the EST2 \u22121 RF signal beginning at nucleotide 1653. To confirm this, a series of time course mRNA decay assays were performed employing the PGK1-EST2 \u22121 RF reporter, the readthrough control, and the PTC containing construct in cells harboring the temperature sensitive rpb1-1 allele of RNA polymerase II. At the zero time point, cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature (42\u00b0C) to arrest transcription of mRNAs, total cellular mRNAs were extracted at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 min. subsequent to the temperature shift, and RNA blots were hybridized with the firefly luciferase and U3 snoRNA probes. While the readthrough control was stable in wild-type cells (Figure 3A and D), both the PTC containing control and the reporter containing the EST2 \u22121 RF signal promoted rapid exponential decay of the reporter mRNA, thus demonstrating that this \u22121 RF signal can operate as an mRNA destabilizing element (Figure 3B\u2013D). In a parallel experiment using rpb1-1 upf1\u0394 cells, all of the reporter mRNAs remained stable (Figure 3E\u2013H). The rapid decay kinetic profile of the EST2 \u22121 RF containing reporter, and its stabilization in NMD-deficient cells are consistent with NMD being the major decay pathway triggered by this element (19). To independently test of this, the A AAA AAT slippery site was partially inactivated by mutating it to G AAG AAC. This silent mutation stabilized the reporter mRNA \u223c19-fold compared to the wild-type slippery site in wild-type, i.e. DOM34 cells (Figure 3I). Interestingly, this is less than the 35-fold stabilization in upf1\u0394 cells. One would expect that, since NMD is dependent of \u22121 RF, then inactivation of \u22121 RF should be quantitatively the same as inactivation of NMD. To address this, the steady state abundance of the G AAG AAC slippery site containing PGK1 reporter was assayed in an isogenic dom34\u0394 strain (Figure 3I, dom34\u0394 lane). This combination increased the steady-state abundance of the reporter mRNA to near wild-type levels.\n",

Silent protein coding changes were introduced into the slippery sites of all 5 of the \u22121 RF signals in a full-length EST2 clone expressed from a low copy vector (pEST2ss\u0394, Figure 4A). Clones expressing either wild-type EST2 (pEST2) or pEST2ss\u0394 were introduced into isogenic est2\u0394 or est2\u0394 upf1\u0394 cells, and qRT-PCR analyses were performed. These silent mutations resulted \u223c8.5-fold increase in the abundance of the full-length EST2ss\u0394 mRNA relative to wild-type EST2 mRNA (Figure 4B). Similarly, abrogation of NMD increased the abundance of the wild-type EST2 and EST2ss\u0394 mRNAs \u223c5.8-fold and \u223c7.0-fold, respectively.

To address this, the BUB3, EST2, SPR6 and TBF1 orthologs were identified in S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, S. castellii, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri, and analyzed for potentially significant \u22121 RF signals as previously described (15). At first glance, these analyses reveal that no single \u22121 RF signal is completely conserved among the budding yeasts (Supplementary Table S4). However, closer analysis shows that strong candidate \u22121 RF signals can be identified in the orthologs of all of these genes, although not in every species. For example, as noted above, the S. cerevisiae EST2 mRNA contains five potential \u22121 RF signals. Similarly, the S. paradoxus ortholog contains five potential \u22121 RF signals, although none are identical to the S. cerevisiae elements. S. mikatae EST2 appears to harbor two potential \u22121 RF signals, S. bayanus has three, and S. castelli contains two, and S. kluyveri has three. None were identified in the S. kudriavzevii EST2 ortholog. Turning to SPR6, the S. cerevisiae mRNA contains a second potential \u22121 RF signal beginning at nucleotide 348 in addition to that identified beginning at nucleotide 279 (see http://cbmgintra.umd.edu/prfdb/index.cgi/detail?id=1755&accession=SGDID:S0000917&slipstart=348). Both the S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii SPR6 orthologs contain three potential \u22121 RF signals, but none were identified in the S. mikatae S. bayanus or S. castelli orthologs. Interestingly, the S. kluyveri SPR6 ortholog contains a slippery site followed by a strong stem-loop structure; while this may or may not constitute a \u22121 RF signal, it does suggest the presence of a rapidly evolving cis-acting element (see Discussion below). S. cerevisiae BUB3 contains the operational \u22121 RF signal at nucleotide 858, plus potential \u22121 RF signals beginning at nucleotides 27 and 732. The orthologous mRNAs in S. paradoxus, S. bayanus, S. castelli and S. kudriavzevii each appear to have one potential \u22121 RF signal, but none were identified in S. mikatae or S. kluyveri. Lastly, the S. cerevisiae TBF1 mRNA has only the single confirmed \u22121 RF signal. The S. castelli, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri orthologs contain two each, and the S. mikatae has one. No potential \u22121 RF signals were identified in either S. paradoxus or S. bayanus. As a control, six S. cerevisiae genes lacking predicted \u22121 RF signals were selected (PGK1, HHT1, TEF2, MIC14, CMD1 and GRX1), orthologs from the six other yeast species identified, and these were in turn queried for the presence of putative \u22121 RF signals. These analyses revealed that none of the orthologs of these six genes contain predicted \u22121 RF signals (Supplementary Table S5, and hyperlinked data therein). The potential evolutionary significance these observations are discussed below.",

            "text": "In a prior proof-of-principle experiment, we utilized the well characterized \u22121 PRF signal from the yeast L-A dsRNA virus to demonstrate that these elements can generally function as mRNA destabilizing elements through the NMD pathway (19). Subsequently, a bioinformatics approach was used to determine that potential \u22121 RF signals are widely found in all genomes examined, and that the great majority of these are predicted to direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons (15,17). Here, we show that these chromosomally encoded, endogenous \u22121 RF signals can also function as cis-acting mRNA destabilizing elements, both in the context of a reporter mRNA, and also in one case in a natural context. Further, we demonstrated that \u22121 RF signals can differentially affect mRNA abundance through the NMD pathway, and the data are also consistent with destabilization through NGD. These are modeled in Figure 5. In support of this idea, the EST2, BUB3 and SPR6 mRNAs were all stabilized in upf1\u0394, upd2\u0394/nmd2\u0394, upf3\u0394, dcp1\u0394 and xrn1\u0394 cells (37), and the half-lives of these mRNAs were less than the mean in wild-type cells (38). Interestingly, TBF1 is not represented in these databases. In the case of a ribosome shifting reading frame into a PTC, the surveillance complex led by the Upf proteins signals rapid decapping by Dcp1p/Dcp2p, followed by deadenylation and exonucleolytic decay via Xrn1p and the exosome. In parallel, the NGD pathway can be activated by ribosomes that are stalled at strong secondary structures in mRNAs. Stalled ribosomes are freed from mRNAs by Dom34p/Hbs1p, promoting exonucleolytic cleavage at unpaired nucleotides near the pause, thus resulting in two mRNA fragments which become substrates for decapping and exonucleolytic decay [reviewed in (39)]. The findings presented here suggest that cells are not only well equipped to deal with aberrant messages which contain premature termination codons and to clear stalled ribosomes from mRNAs, but have also evolved to capitalize upon these functions to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression.\n",

It is important to note however that the software used to predict mRNA pseudoknots can neither identify base triples, which make major contributions to frameshifting (40\u201344), let alone calculate their contributions to thermodynamic stability. Regardless, this combination of high frameshifting and thermodynamic stability results in very strong destabilization via NMD (Figure 2B), and perhaps NGD as well (Figure 2C). As discussed previously (19), the exponential decay profile suggests that NMD can occur beyond the \u2018pioneer round\u2019 of translation.",

Thus, all of its mRNA destabilization activity was through NMD (compare Figure 2B with C). The thermodynamic stability of the BUB3 signal is predicted to have an intermediate value to EST2 and TBF1 (\u223c\u221212 kcal/mol), and hence the potential contribution of NGD to the stability of its reporter was significant. Interestingly, this signal only promoted \u223c1% frameshifting (15), yet the contribution of NMD to its destabilization was greater than observed for TBF1. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may stem from the fact that, in order to measure frameshifting, one base had to be deleted from the spacer region between the slippery site and the stimulatory pseudoknot. Changes in the length and composition of this spacer are known to affect rates of \u22121 PRF (45), and thus the \u22121 RF values so determined cannot be taken as absolute. In contrast, the reporters used to monitor mRNA stability contained the native sequences. In light of this, it is likely that the native BUB3 \u22121 RF signal promotes more frameshifting than the TBF1 signal. Lastly, the SPR6 \u22121 RF signal is predicted to be quite stable (\u223c\u221220 kcal/mol), yet promoted very low levels of frameshifting (\u223c0.5%) (15). Accordingly, destabilization via NMD was negligible for this element, while NGD appeared to be the major contributor.",

            "text": "Beyond the pro forma demonstration that \u22121 RF signals can decrease cellular mRNA abundance, it is important to begin to understand the biological function of this phenomenon. As a first step in this direction, we showed that silently mutating the slippery sites in 5 predicted \u22121 RF signals within a full-length clone of EST2 significantly stabilized its encoded mRNA (Figure 5B). Similarly, abrogation of NMD stabilized this message, while changes in \u22121 RF efficiency inversely correlated with EST2 steady-state mRNA abundance. Est2p is the reverse transcriptase subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme (21). Interestingly, prior studies have demonstrated that this mRNA, along with other mRNAs encoding proteins having telomere-associated functions, are stabilized in NMD\u2212 yeast cells (33,37). Analysis of the Programmed Ribosomal Frameshift Database (http://prfdb.umd.edu/) reveals that, along with the other four putative \u22121 RF signals in the EST2 mRNA, the mRNAs encoding Est1p, Stn1p, Cdc13p and Orc5p, all components or regulators of telomerase that are stabilized in NMD\u2212 cells, also contain high confidence \u22121 RF signals (Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, the EST3 mRNA contains a +1 PRF signal (46). Intriguingly, telomerase is limiting in cells: while a yeast cell contains 64 chromosome ends, there are only \u223c29 telomerase molecules per cell, and telomerase is preferentially recruited to short telomeres (47). Additionally, Tbf1p is a telobox containing general regulatory factor that binds to TTAGGG repeats within subtelomeric anti-silencing regions (48). Intriguingly, ablation of NMD (49) or overexpression of single components of telomerase-associated proteins, i.e. the TEL1 RNA, Est2p, Stn1p or Cdc13p resulted in changes in telomere length (47,50,51).",

            "text": "We hypothesize that yeast cells use \u22121 RF to limit the expression of these proteins in order to maintain the correct stoichiometric balance among telomere associated components. Corollary to this, mutations that alter \u22121 RF and/or NMD should affect telomere function, and should thus show phenotypic defects similar to those observed in telomerase mutants, e.g. cell cycle progression defects. Indeed, we have isolated numerous such mutants [reviewed in (52)], and have reported that the mof2-1 and mof5-1 mutants, which affect both NMD and \u22121 RF tend to accumulate large mother-daughter cells, and/or multiply budded cells, typical of G2/M cell cycle defects (53). Similarly, upf1\u0394 cells have abnormally elongated buds, and decreased telomere lengths (54,55). Intriguingly, mof6-1 mutants, which only affect \u22121 RF, arrest as large, unbudded cells, typical of M-phase exit defects (53). These observations suggest that stabilization of the mRNAs encoding multiple telomere-associated proteins may have dominant negative effects on telomere homeostasis, and that NMD and \u22121 RF may regulate different aspects of the cell cycle. Additionally, the central role of Bub3p at the mitotic cell cycle spindle assembly checkpoint and the progeroid phenotypes caused by Bub3p deficiency (56) suggest a more general role for \u22121 RF in control of cell growth and division. Lastly, the expression of Spr6p during sporulation (57) suggests a role for \u22121 RF in this developmental process as well. Future studies will dissect the roles of the \u22121 RF signals in these mRNAs.",

            "text": "Finally, if \u22121 RF is widely used to regulate gene expression, then it should be well conserved. The major problem associated with attempting a phylogenetic analysis of \u22121 RF signals is the inherent limitations of the software used to predict them. In short, it is not well enough developed to automatically identify matching motifs. In an attempt to begin to address this issue, the orthologous Bub3p, Est2p, Spr6p and Tbf1p\u2019s in six closely related yeast species were identified, their nucleotide sequences extracted from the Yeast Gene Order Browser (28), and analyzed for the presence of potential \u22121 RF signals. These analyses revealed that while specific \u22121 RF signals do not appear to be evolutionarily conserved, \u22121 RF itself may be relatively well-enough conserved as a mechanism to post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of these genes across many but not all species examined (see Supplementary Table S4). Importantly, the control experiment showed that putative \u22121 RF signals were not detected in any of the orthologs of six S. cerevisiae genes that themselves were not predicted to contain \u22121 RF signals. These observations are in agreement with current evolutionary theory based on analyses of 5\u2032 UTR sequences of Drosophila species proposing that rapid rates of mutation in cis-acting regulatory elements drives speciation because they confer very specific effects on gene expression, as opposed to mutations affecting protein structure, the pleiotrophic effects of which impose very high penalties on fitness (58\u201360). The findings presented in this work, i.e. that while \u22121 RF signals are not conserved in orthologs from other yeasts, these ORFs contain generically contain \u22121 RF signals, and that the absence of \u22121 RF signals in other orthologous ORFs, agrees very well with this theory of molecular evolution.",
