A prospective population-based study in Spain of both inpatients and outpatients found that Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.7%) was the most common agent, followed by Coxiella burnetii (18.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (15.9%), respiratory viruses (14.4%), Chlamydia species (10.6%) and Legionella pneumophila (4.4%) [4]. The microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia appears to be unchanged from that found in earlier studies. The high prevalence of C. burnetii has been reported in previous studies from Spain. Patients infected with conventional bacteria such as S. pneumoniae had a higher hospitalization rate, higher CURB65 (disease severity) scores at admission and more adverse clinical outcomes, such as severe sepsis, septic shock, ICU admission and longer length of stay compared to those with atypical and viral causes of pneumonia. Limitations in the study included an absence of sputum cultures and possible population bias.",

They suggested that levels of procalcitonin and C reactive protein positively correlate with increasing severity of community-acquired pneumonia and may have a role in disease prediction, perhaps in patients with low CURB65 scores [18]. Limitations of the study included study heterogeneity and risk of publication bias. Using a procalcitonin algorithm on antibiotic guidance reduced antibiotic use without increased complications.

Studies in meningitis and pneumocystis pneumonia support their role in infection control but, until recently, studies in community-acquired pneumonia were absent. The conflicting results from studies in sepsis confirmed the need for community-acquired pneumonia-specific studies, preferably randomised controlled trials. A recent double blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial using 40 mg prednisolone for 7 days as the intervention found that there were no beneficial effects of adjunctive corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Other outcomes of the study showed that clinical cure was equal in both groups at Day 7 [31]. A similar study using dexamethasone for 3 days did find a reduced hospital stay of one day in the steroid-treated patients, but a large number of exclusions and lack of control for other factors limiting length of stay limited the usefulness of this study [32]. The only other randomised controlled trial evaluating patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to ICU found a reduction in mortality using hydrocortisone [33]. The small patient number and absence of any deaths in the intervention arm mean that these findings cannot be generalised unless reproduced in other studies. A role for steroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is yet to be proved.",
