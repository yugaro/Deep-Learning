In addition, they are also involved in the maintenance of homeostasis because they release growth factors and enzymes for tissue renewal and remodeling. Similar to lymphocytes, macrophages display considerable functional heterogeneity and are classified according to both their ability to release cytokines and chemokines and their expression of specific receptors. This heterogeneity probably reflects the plasticity and versatility of macrophages in their response to signals from the microenvironment.13,14",

In 1964, the idea was further expounded, and between 1966 and 1971, lymphocytes were identified as the major antigen-specific cells responsible for macrophage microbicidal activation.96\u201398 The discovery of IFN-\u03b3 in 1983 was the determinant for the proposal of the classical pathway of macrophage activation.99 It is important to note that in 1986, the identification of the two subpopulations of T lymphocytes (Th1 and Th2) represented further advances underlying the emergence of the spectral macrophage concept.100 In 1992, the concept of M2 macrophages began to be constructed, and in 2000, Mills et al101,102 proposed the classification of M1 and M2 macrophages based on the response mediated by Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes. Between 2002 and 2006, the concepts of activation, heterogeneity, and plasticity of M1 and M2 macrophages were amplified given the diversity of a set of experimental models, which heralded the appearance of M2 subtypes M2a, M2b, and others.103\u2013106 However, the theoretical basis of the response behavior of macrophages indicates a complex relationship, mainly with polarization. In 2010, Biswas and Mantovani107,108 showed a response paradigm between M1 and M2 macrophages. Finally, during the last few years, technological advances have led to deeper discussions on the polarization of response of M1 and M2 macrophages. In 2014, Murray et al80 attempted to standardize terminology regarding macrophage polarization concepts from the responses obtained in several experimental models. However, problems still exist at the conceptual level, particularly regarding the stabilization of macrophage subpopulations through their participation in pathophysiological, pathological, and immunological mechanisms (Figure 1).109\u2013111",

In this context, NO is able to inhibit the expression of NF-\u03baB, one of the major transcription factors responsible for inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1.157 Controversial events in the immunopathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection are crucial in the interpretation of iNOS and Arg1 responses when the tissue microenvironment in tuberculoid granulomas are analyzed.

In vitro, for example, TNF-\u03b1 inhibits IL-4-induced Arg1 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The consequences of this inactivation directly affect the phosphorylation and translocation of STAT6 to mediate production of Arg1.161 In vivo Leishmania infections mainly show that in C57BL/6WT, the control of the cellular and microbicidal stress response is regulated by NOS2 and Arg1 with a predominance of NOS2 and NO. In the case of C57BL/6WT TNF\u2212/- BALB/c, this change favors pathogen survival as well as non-phenotype change and a balanced expression of NOS2 and Arg1.161 In Tie2Cre\u00b1Argfl/fl mice, the amastigote forms of Leishmania major are destroyed in activated macrophages where the inflammatory response is accentuated. In light of this, we conclude that the expression of TNF-\u03b1 influences change in the cellular phenotype and potentiates the response of M1 macrophages in situ by Arg1 deletion, histone acetylation, and NOS2 and NO production. Interestingly, deletion of Arg1 can restore control of parasite proliferation in animals that evolved resistance.161",

            "text": "One of the key issues arising from the discussion of this subject is understanding the response that PRRs can induce through the recognition of PAMPs of certain microorganisms. Classically, receptors such as those in the Toll family agglutinate a variable range from TLR1 to TLR13.166\u2013168 Therefore, in the case of mycobacteria, the importance of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 in the development of the microbicidal response is paramount since the regulation of the intracellular cascade involves the binding of MyD88 and Mal, also known as TIRAP, which recruits IRAK1/4, TRAF6, and TRICA1 to induce the production of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-\u03baB.169\u2013171 As a final outcome, NF-kB is responsible for inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 that participate in the activation of macrophages and enzymes such as iNOS, which is responsible the generation of ROS and destruction of the microorganism.126,172,173 However, the immune evasion strategies adopted by mycobacteria include a series of events aimed at inactivating this mechanism. With regard to M. tuberculosis, TLR2 is the main receptor by which mycobacteria modulate immune escape. Therefore, the interaction between TLR2, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 drastically suppresses the immune response of macrophages by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation, iNOS, and NO production.174 Nevertheless, recognition events of PAMPs show that M. tuberculosis mutants produce sulfoglycolipids that antagonize the activation of both TLR2 and NF-\u03baB.175 Interestingly, in this same dynamic, the bacterium can subvert the TLR2-MyD88 pathway and facilitate its translocation into the cytosol. The consequences of this modulation include the direct involvement of H37Rv strains and the escape of the phagosome or phagolysosome.176 It is worth mentioning that immune evasion via modulation of TLR2 by the recombinant lipoprotein Rv1016c, induces apoptosis of macrophages by increasing annexin expression.177 Consequently, this relationship becomes beneficial because in addition to Rv1016c inhibition of MHC-II expression, TLR2-dependent apoptosis may promote the release of residual bacilli into apoptotic cells and, thereby, decrease the recognition of CD4+ T cells, impairing surveillance in chronic disease conditions (Figure 3).177",

To survive in a hostile environment, these microorganisms have developed a series of mechanisms aimed at neutralizing one of the cell\u2019s primary lines of defense. It starts at the point of inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine response (IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1), where this relationship influences the endosome immaturity.186\u2013188 Incidentally, Rab family proteins are actively involved in this process. In this context, Rab5 and 7 are directly related to the early and late fusion of the endosome and lysosome, respectively. The stage of immaturity of the phagosome is organized in this duality of interaction between early and late fusion.189\u2013191 Therefore, microorganisms initially maintain Rab5 expression in order to facilitate recruitment of coronin 1a protein and the development of the calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway whose final outcome is the loss of fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome (Figure 3).192\u2013194 The implications of this catastrophic cellular effect include the inhibition of late markers such as Rab7 and the loss of various hydrolases such as cathepsin D. Another final point that dramatically impacts the immune escape of pathogens is inhibition of PI3K, which deregulates the gallbladder traffic in the Golgi apparatus (Figure 3).195\u2013197",

This is attributed to the fact that TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, and MDA5 are largely produced by the cell. In this context, the modulation of viral replication starts from information that is passed to the cytoplasm where RIG-1 and MDA5 recognize single-stranded RNA viruses to facilitate the formation of the IKK complex (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3). Consequently, the phosphorylation and migration of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 and 7 to the nucleus activate genes responsible for inducing the production of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 (Figure 4).198\u2013200 However, the strategies used by the virus modulate the immune evasion mechanism, whereas non-structural NSs of DENV, WNV, ZIKV, and HCV flaviviruses inhibit activation of RIG-I and MDA5 as well as a series of intracellular markers during the inactivation of molecules such as STING, MAVS, and NF-\u03baB. This mechanism directly affects the inhibition of ISGs, Mx, OS, PKR, and the production of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2. In the case of type 1 IFN, intracellular signaling triggered by receptor-cytokine binding influences concomitant activation and phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT2, as well as the formation of STAT/IRF complexes that primarily activate genes associated with the production of inflammatory mediators responsible for inhibiting viral replication (Figure 4).201\u2013203 Assuming that negative regulation coupled to non-structural proteins of flavivirus or HCV is crucial for viral survival, the immune leakage, in this case, mainly inhibits intracellular signaling pathways (Figure 4).",

It is worth noting that Annexin V, light chain 3 (LC3), beclin 1, and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) participate actively in this mechanism.207 On the other hand, T. cruzi uses autophagy to subvert the lysosomal exocytic process and invade host cells under basal conditions. This occurs frequently because of recruitment of the LC3 protein.208 Interestingly, when the process is induced by starvation or rapamycin, autophagolysosome formation and LC3 expression is increased. This also results in large-scale formation of the parasitoid vacuole.

The events of autophagy manipulation are mainly modulated by non-structural proteins, such as NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B.215\u2013217 Interestingly, at the beginning of the infection, both NS4A and NS4B manipulate the cell to mediate membrane curvature and induce autophagy. This process mobilizes the membranes and lipids to establish a proviral event that facilitates viral replication. This directly impacts regulation of the Golgi apparatus because NS2B/3 induces the production of proteases that trigger the cleavage of FAM134B, one of the main receptors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy.218 Finally, it is worth mentioning that in this dynamic, NS4A can deregulate the PI3K pathway, which, in turn, impairs the conversion of the LC3-I protein to LC3-II (Figure 4).215,219",

In hepatitis C, chronic infection can lead to cell damage and cirrhosis, and the virus can induce an immune response, targeting the viral protein NS3, mediated by IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 produced by M1 macrophages. This process creates a pro-inflammatory environment that contributes to the induction of cell injury. A similar process occurs in the liver of patients infected with dengue virus and yellow fever, where cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 released by Kupffer cells, contribute to the development of a pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic environment in tissue hepatic necrosis, which leads to massive apoptosis of hepatocytes because of the proapoptotic action of TGF-\u03b2.290,291 Viral influenza infections have been linked to lung injury induced by M1 macrophage-associated cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6. Furthermore, these lung lesions might be attenuated in coinfection by Staphylococcus aureus, which is normally present in the airway mucosal microbiota, because of the bacterium\u2019s ability to stimulate the expression of M2 macrophages.292\u2013294 Conversely, in the pathogenesis of coronavirus and cytomegalovirus infections, the lesions that develop are related to the induction of an inflammatory environment mediated by M2 macrophages, which indicates that viral agents can still benefit from the induction of specific tissue environments related to the Th2 response and, consequently, tissue repair and induction of tissue fibrosis.287,295\u2013299",

Depending on the stimulus, cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, may influence the process of shifting the M0 macrophage to M1. In this scenario, we highlight the performance of IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, and TLR4 that influence development of intracellular cascade, which aims to produce of a series of markers to enhance the pro-inflammatory response in several aspects of classical pathway. In contrast, the antagonistic relationship between the duality of M1/M2 macrophages shows that IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines are mainly responsible for inducing differentiation of macrophages from M0 to M2. In the alternative pathway, activation of IL-4R\u03b1 or IL-10R shows that IL-4, IL-13, or IL-10 directly modulate development of anti-inflammatory responses and tissue repair. Through pathways of polarization, we emphasized the significance of M4 macrophages in the modulation of oxidative stress response as well as tissue repair. This relationship is particularly important in pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, where formation of foam cells due to LDL accumulation and low phagocytosis implies a regulatory phenomenon that triggers the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MRP8, MMP7, and MMP12.",

            "text": "Figure 3: Immune evasion and strategies adopted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leishmania, and Trypanosomiasis cruzi to evade microbicidal response of macrophages. Because it is a sequence of events that trigger destruction of microorganisms, immune escape strategies that inhibit microbicidal responses are as varied as possible. However, we seek to centralize an understanding of the crucial points that facilitate a pathogen\u2019s survival in the environment. For M. tuberculosis, it is noteworthy that TLR2 is the main receptor by which the immune escape correlates with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 response, whereas inhibitory modulation mainly affects the inflammatory cascade associated with NF-\u03baB and to iNOS. Since sufoglycolipids inhibit activation of TLR2 and NF-\u03baB, this not only compromises the microbicidal response but also facilitates the survival and proliferation of the bacillus. Through evolution of mycobacterial destruction mechanisms, adaptation of pathogens to evade the immune system has generated certain strains such as H37Rv that modulate phagosome maturation and facilitate translocation of bacillus to the cytosol. In addition, a recombinant lipoprotein derived from M. tuberculosis, such as RV1016c, regulates the mechanism of apoptosis through the annexins. This is crucial to facilitating proliferation of the bacillus in the tissue environment because RV1016c inhibits MHC II expression, compromising the CD4 T cell response and immune surveillance. Considering that the cytokine response is fundamental to induce the activation of macrophages, as well as the microbicidal response, M. tuberculosis inhibits the action of IFN-\u03b3 by inhibiting autophagy through responses of IL-6 and IL-27. Expansion of this scenario negatively regulates Atg12-atg5 and positive intracellular cascade involving JAK/PIK3/AKt/mTOR/Mcl1. Implications of such events are inhibitive of phagolysosome maturation and, consequently, the microbicidal response of the cell, which favors pathogen survival in phagocytes. With regard to protozoa, we highlight Leishmania, which, in addition to using the cells of the phagocytic system as a reservoir, also uses innumerable strategies of immune evasion to survive. Therefore, Leishmania major modulates TLR2 responses to induce SOCS1 and 3 to inhibit not only intracellular cascades of NF-\u03baB but also the response of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. For Leishmania donovani, by ubiquitination of TRAF 6 through A20, the response of NK-\u03baB is compromised as well as the production of IL-6 and IL-12. Interestingly, L. major modulates immunosuppressive responses to facilitate its survival, and L. donovani follows the same path by mainly regulating expression of SOCS1 and 3 to avoid oxidative stress and catastrophic effects that may occur with apoptosis. Despite this dynamic, Leishmania amazonensis can induce macrophages to produce IFN-\u03b2 to generate SOD in order to create an environment conducive for the parasite to evade the immune system, survive, and multiply. Considering that vesicular traffic is fundamental for phagosome maturation, either protozoa or M. tuberculosis manipulates macrophages to maintain Rab5 expression increased to establish early phagosome fusion with lysosome, as well as formation of the calcium-calcineurin complex to inhibit the production of cathepsin D and Rab7 and to facilitate the survival of the pathogens. The effect of evasion of Leishmania with T. cruzi is very peculiar in the case of leishmaniasis, autophagy is explored to eliminate promastigotes forms and reduce responses of T cells. In contrast, T. cruzi uses autophagy as a central point to invade phagocytic cells and multiplies whether at basal levels or not. Interestingly, LC3 protein serves as the gateway to mediate this process.",

            "text": "Figure 4: Antiviral response and immune escape mechanism triggered by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and flaviviruses DENV, ZIKV, and WNV. Among PRRs, RLRs are extremely important in development of antiviral responses mainly associated with actions of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2. Among the receptors, we highlight RIG-I and MDA5 that recognize PAMPs either HCV or flaviviruses to activate MAVS and STING, which in turn, provoke the formation of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and NEMO/IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2 complex. This mechanism has the final product for both phosphorylation of IRF7 and IRF3 and the release of KF-\u03baB p50/p65 subunit that migrates to the nucleus to activate genes responsible for production of inflammatory cytokines and IFN-type 1. In the case of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2, IFNR activation recruits JAK1 and TYR2, which when phosphorylated, trigger formation of an intracellular cascade that culminates in formation of the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 complex, which migrates to the nucleus, activating genes associated with the antiviral response such as Mx, OAS, PKR, and ISGs. To evade the immune response, HCV or flaviviruses induce the production of non-structural proteins that inhibit response of several markers at points considered essential for the development of the intracellular cascade, facilitating the viral replication process. A priori WNV can establish primordial control of antiviral responses at the level of inhibition of RIG-I and MDA5. In another follow-up, ZIKV, DENV, WNW, or HCV through NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, or NS5 inhibit TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex formation, IRF3 and 7 phosphorylation, and NF-\u03baB activation. In the response by IFN-type 1, NSEN of DENV and WNV inhibited activation of JAK1/TYR2. HCV NS5A inhibits activation of STAT1 and 2. Among various immune escape mechanisms, autophagy is critical for flavivirus to mediate biogenesis of viral replication, mainly because of changes in pH and endocytosis. In this sequence, it is worth noting that NS2B and NS4A/B proteins can manipulate autophagy to alter membrane curvature in the Golgi apparatus to facilitate viral replication. However, in another follow-up, NS2B/3 cleaves FAM134B into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to suppress autophagolysosome formation and reticulophage, a form of selective autophagy, to facilitate viral replication. As a result, NS4A induces cells to produce PIK3, which impair the conversion of LC3I to LC3II and inhibit autophagy.",
