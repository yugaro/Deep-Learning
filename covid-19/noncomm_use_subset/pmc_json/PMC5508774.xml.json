The patient\u2019s symptoms and lymphocytic pleocytosis on admission were consistent with acute viral meningitis. Tacrolimus toxicity may have also contributed to her presentation because she improved rapidly after tacrolimus discontinuation. The patient\u2019s persistent low-level transaminitis for several years before admission and subsequent evidence of cirrhosis suggest that she was likely chronically infected with HEV. Although initial testing for HEV IgG was negative, serologies can be unreliable in immunosuppressed patients [6]. Her prior episodes in 2013 and 2016 of seizure and \u201cencephalopathy\u201d are also suggestive of chronic neuroinvasive HEV disease with intermittent flares.",

Neurologic manifestations of HEV infection, including inflammatory polyradiculopathy, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, have been seen in 5.5% of cases [9]. The timing of neurological manifestations after HEV infection has not been well described, but ranged from 12\u201360 months in 1 review of 6 cases in immunosuppressed patients. In animal models, HEV is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, replicate in the central nervous system, and cause neuronal necrosis and myelin degeneration [10].",

Clinicians should consider HEV in the differential diagnosis for SOT or other immunosuppressed patients with unexplained hepatitis, particularly those taking calcineurin inhibitors [8]. The treatment of chronic HEV infection includes reduction in immunosuppression, enabling viral clearance in approximately 30% of SOT patients [12].
