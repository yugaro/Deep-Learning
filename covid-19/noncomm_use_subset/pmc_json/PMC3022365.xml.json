In aggregate these studies establish that inositol phospholipid signalling plays a pivotal role in the formation, homeostasis and function of both myeloid and lymphoid immunoregulatory cell populations.",

Surprisingly, our analysis reveals a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestine with a concomitant increase in neutrophils at this site. Consistent with altered immune status we find spontaneous development of ileitis with features that closely recapitulate those of CD pathology. In addition, the susceptibility factor for this CD-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice appears to be in the haematopoietic compartment, and likely granulocyte\u2013monocyte, as the CD-like ileitis was transferable to an immunocompetent host following irradiation and reconstitution with SHIP splenocytes, but not following transfer of either T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Consequently, the SHIP-deficient mouse is the first CD animal model capable of adoptively transferring CD-like disease to an immunocompetent host.",

To test this possibility we analysed intestinal pathology in MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice where SHIP expression is normal in fetal, neonatal and adolescent life, but can be ablated during adulthood following polyI/C administration.33 This approach results in eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia in adult mice rendered SHIP deficient.49 For this analysis twelve 6\u20138 week old MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice and twelve SHIPflox/flox controls, each of both sexes were submitted to comparable histopathological analyses. Primary gastrointestinal lesions were present only within the ileum of MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice, while SHIPflox/flox mice were unaffected 4\u20135 weeks after the last injection of polyI/C. Of the 12 MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice evaluated, only 1 (8%) lacked ileitis, while 11 of 12 (92%) developed ileitis with a mean inflammatory grade of 3.5\u00b11.9. Comparable to ileitis of SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and SHIP\u0394IP/\u0394IP mice, ileitis of MxCre SHIP flox/flox mice was segmental in nature with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations. Granuloma formation was evident in 2 of 12 (17%) of MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice. Thus, CD-like ileitis develops with selective deletion in adult mice, illustrating that SHIP expression is required to maintain normal mucosal immune homeostasis and regulation in the adult ileum.",

The lungs and intestines were then analysed 1 month later for evidence of pathology. Segmental ileitis similar to that observed in germline SHIP-deficient mice was present in 5 of 6 WT mice that received SHIP\u2212/\u2212 splenocytes with a mean ileitis score of 1.8 (the range of scores was 0\u20135). This analysis demonstrates that SHIP-deficiency of the haematolymphoid compartment is sufficient to alter enteric immune cell homeostatic responses in the small intestine resulting in a CD-like phenotype. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of FACS-purified CD3+ T cells, NK1.1+CD3\u2212 NK cells prepared from the spleens of SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice was unable to transfer any detectable ileitis to WT hosts (three hosts analysed per cell type). Thus, SHIP-deficient T cells or NK cells are sufficient for transfer of ileitis. We also observed that SHIP\u2212/\u2212 splenocytes transfer a mild to moderate eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia to WT hosts with progression to patchy pulmonary consolidation in some cases as is observed in both germline SHIP-deficient mice41 and MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice following gene ablation.49",

To further evaluate this possibility, we conducted multi-parametric cytometry assays of major immune cell populations including neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4/CD8 T cells and Treg cells present in small intestines of SHIP-deficient and WT mice. In support of a role for neutrophils in ileitis, we find there is an absolute increase in total number of neutrophils present in the small intestine of SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice (figure 10). This applied to neutrophils of the Ly6G+CD16/32+ phenotype as well as the CD62L+ subset (figure 10 A,B). These findings of ileal neutrophilia are consistent with our histopathology studies described above. Surprisingly, we find a profound reduction in the number of both CD4 (figure 11A) and CD8 (figure 11B) T cells present in SHIP-deficient small intestines. When paired with the T cell adoptive transfer studies described above, these findings suggest that the CD-like ileitis observed in SHIP-deficient mice is not attributable to an autoimmune attack by SHIP-deficient T cells. Analysis of CD11c+CD11b+ mature dendritic cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells did not show a significant difference in the numbers of these immune cells between SHIP\u2212/\u2212 and WT small intestines.",

Although elements of CD pathology are lacking in the SHIP-deficient mouse described herein, including development of multiple aphthoid ulcers, pyloric gland metaplasia, granulation tissue, and fistula formation, many CD histopathological features are present. SHIP-deficient ileitis is not precipitated by an apparent dysfunction on the part of SHIP-deficient parenchymal elements as reconstitution of SHIP\u2212/\u2212 hosts with SHIP-competent haematolymphoid cells prevents development of ileitis. However, these same hosts still retain some facets of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia indicating that SHIP\u2212/\u2212 parenchymal elements may contribute to the lung pathology found in germline SHIP-deficient mice. Conversely, we find that transfer of SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells from the spleen is sufficient to trigger CD-like ileitis in an immunocompetent host. Transfer of cells capable of a cell-mediated immune attack, T cells and NK cells, do not elicit this CD-like ileitis. These findings suggest that a SHIP-deficient myeloid cell may promote the CD-like enteritis that occurs in SHIP-deficient mice. Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice, granulocyte\u2013monocyte infiltrations can be found in various tissues of SHIP-deficient mice,44 and mononuclear phagocytes are essential for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.50",

Conversely, that the CD-like phenotype can be transferred to an immunocompetent host by SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cells suggests that SHIP-deficient ileitis is due to an alteration in the regulation of innate immune functions (eg, granulocyte\u2013monocyte responses), a failure of T cell mediated mucosal barrier functions or a combination of such potential alterations. Ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may result from a deficit in mucosal T cell function that permits inappropriate granulocyte\u2013monocyte responses to commensal organisms and luminal antigens culminating in the inflamed states observed in the ileum of SHIP-deficient mice.",

There are a number of possible candidates for the enteritis-inducing cell. Because we observed neutrophilic infiltrates in the distal ileum lamina propria of most SHIP-deficient mice, we speculate that inappropriate responses by neutrophils to commensal microflora in the lumen of the ileum may underlie or trigger the immune attack. SHIP plays a pivotal role in preventing neutrophilia, as granulocyte numbers in peripheral blood are profoundly increased in SHIP\u2212/\u2212 mice41 as well as mice treated with a SHIP1 selective inhibitor, 3AC.49 Inappropriate effector function by SHIP\u2212/\u2212 neutrophils at organ sites has not been examined to date, and thus our findings represent the first indication of neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in SHIP-deficient hosts. Conversely, it seems unlikely that the enteritis results from inappropriate T cell attack in the small intestine, as SHIP-deficiency causes a profound local deficit in both CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers in the small intestine, while normal numbers of Treg cells are still present at this site.",

Moreover, because the phenotype occurs in the SHIP\u0394IP\u0394IP strain where only the inositol phosphatase domain encoding exons of SHIP are excised, we conclude that the phenotype is dependent on loss of SHIP enzymatic activity. SHIP through its 5\u2032-inositol phosphatase domain hydrolyses the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3 and thus limits PI3K activation of key downstream survival and effector pathways promoted by Akt and NF-\u03baB.30 40 However, recent findings indicate that SHIP, via generation of PI(3,4)P2, can also promote cellular survival by increasing activation of Akt,49 consistent with the demonstration that Akt binds to and is more effectively activated by the SHIP product, PI(3,4)P2, than by its substrate, PI(3,4,5)P3.51 Tiwari et al found that SHIP can also promote immune effector function via synthesis of PI(3,4)P2.52 It remains to be determined whether SHIP-deficiency is causing ileitis due to a lack of inhibitory or activating signalling in immune cells. This may be dependent on cellular context. For instance, one could envision that SHIP may be required for efficient mucosal trafficking and survival of T cells via generation of PI(3,4)P2, but by decreasing PI(3,4,5)P3 in neutrophils SHIP is also limiting their numbers and function at this enteric site. Future lineage specific SHIP ablation studies using SHIPflox/flox mice and appropriate Cre transgenes combined with biochemical analysis PI3K effector pathways in these models may elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying SHIP's role in preserving normal immune function/regulation in the ileum.",

Our analysis suggests that in the laboratory mouse, SHIP is a strong genetic determinant of CD-like pathology, suggesting that a similar situation may also be revealed by close examination of SHIP expression and function in CD patients. Tantalising evidence for a role of SHIP1 in human IBD is suggested by the recent demonstration that a chromosome 2 polymorphism located at 2q37 is associated with a significantly increased and early onset of IBD.53 The SHIP1 locus is also found in the 2q37 region of human chromosome 2. This potential association merits comparison of SHIP enzymatic activity in IBD patients and normal controls using a recently developed fluorogenic assay that measures SHIP1 activity.49 Future investigations of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may also provide insights into how immunological alterations contribute to IBD.",
