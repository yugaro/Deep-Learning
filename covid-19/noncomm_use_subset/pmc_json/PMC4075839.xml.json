The findings were predominantly bilateral, with no axial or craniocaudal predominance in the distribution in most cases. When zonal predominance was present, it was more common in the lower thirds and peripheral regions of the lungs. Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. Although the major tomographic findings in H1N1 infection are nonspecific, it is important to recognize such findings in order to include infection with the H1N1 virus in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms",
