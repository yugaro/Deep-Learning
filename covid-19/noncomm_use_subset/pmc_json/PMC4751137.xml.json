Those drugs\ninhibit clathrin dependent endocytosis in different manners. Baf A1 is an antibiotic derived\nfrom Streptomyces griseus and specifically inhibits vacuolar type H+ ATPase\n[23]. CPZ dislocates clathrin, and its adaptor\nprotein from plasma membrane to cytosol [22] and\ndynasore inhibits GTPase activity of dynamin specifically [14]. All inhibitors work reversibly, and therefore, endosome pathway can restart\nonce the drug was removed from the culture. HmLu-1 cells prepared in 6 well plate were treated\nwith Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Wako) containing various concentrations of\ninhibitors for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After cells were chilled on ice for 5 min, the media were\nremoved, and cells were infected with IBAV at MOI=3 for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. After a wash with PBS\n(\u2212), cells were further incubated with DMEM plus inhibitors for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and the media\nwere replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (10FDMEM). Cells were incubated for\nfurther 24 hr, and culture supernatant was collected. Collected supernatant was subjected to\nplaque assay, and after staining with crystal violet solution (0.1% crystal violet in 10%\nbuffered formalin and 20% methanol), the number of plaque was counted. To analyze the\nstatistical significance of each inhibitor concentration group against mock treated group,\nstatistical software R [16] was used to run Dunnet\u2019s\ntest [7]. Figure\n1a shows the number of infectious IBAV in the supernatant of the cells treated with Baf\nA1, CPZ or dynasore. All inhibitors were shown to decrease virus titer when their\nconcentration was elevated. The most significant decrease was observed when Baf A1\nconcentration was higher than 6.25 nM (P=0.0013 for 6.25 nM against 0 nM). At\nthe same time, the effect of those inhibitors to HmLu-1 viability was tested. HmLu-1 cells in\n96 well multiwell plate were treated with media containing various concentrations of\ninhibitors for 1 hr without IBAV infection. After 24 hr incubation, the number of viable cells\nwas quantified using CellTiter\u00ae Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI,\nU.S.A.). As shown in Fig. 1b, no inhibitors\nshowed significant effect on viable cell numbers. These results indicated that IBAV utilizes\nclathrin-dependent endosomal pathway for infection and coincided with the previous research on\nbluetongue virus entry [8].",

To test if low pH treatment can bypass the\ninhibitory effect of endosome inhibitors, we treated IBAV attached to cell surface with PBS\n(pH4) or PBS (pH7) under the presence of endosome inhibitors. Briefly, HmLu-1 was pretreated\nwith inhibitors for 30 min. Cells were chilled on ice for 5 min and infected with IBAV at\nMOI=3 for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. At this step, virus cannot get internalized by endocytosis, because of\nthe low temperature. Attached viruses were treated with PBS (pH4) or PBS (pH7) for 5 min at\n37\u00b0C, and cells were further treated with 10FDMEM plus inhibitor for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After the\n24 hr incubation with 10FDMEM, virus titer in the supernatant was determined. As shown in\nFig. 3a, the significant difference was observed in the virus titer between PBS (PH4) and PBS\n(pH7) only when Baf A1 was used (P=0.0036, Welch\u2019s t-test).\nWhen cells were treated with other inhibitors, different pH of 2 buffers made no difference in\nviral titer. Figure 3b shows the viability of HmLu-1\nafter a series of treatment without virus infection, and no significant difference was\nobserved (P=0.983, Welch\u2019s t-test).",

In addition, it was proved that the exposure to low pH environment is the\nessential condition to initiate IBAV infection. In the presence of Baf A1, the acidification\nof late endosome, as well as its fusion to lysosome is impaired [20, 21]. Although the cell surface\nviruses could be internalized during the post-treatment, they cannot be exposed to low pH\nenvironment in the presence of Baf A1. However, if viruses were exposed to low pH at the cell\nsurface before internalization, they acquired the infectivity and could start infection under\nthe effect of Baf A1. PBS (pH4) failed to enhance IBAV infection under the influence of other\ntwo inhibitors. Since those two inhibitors interrupt endosome pathway at the very beginning,\nno IBAV could be incorporated during post-treatment. This might make both IBAV groups to start\ninfection at the same time and resulted in the same viral titer. Since we could not deny an\ninvolvement of any proteases, additional research will be required to reveal the entire\nmolecular mechanism of orbivirus infection. The importance of low pH environment for IBAV\nactivation that we proved in this study will help to design experimental approach for further\nstudies.",
