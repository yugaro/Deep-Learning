            "text": "Releasing investigational new drugs to individual patients who are facing certain death or disability seems to be a relatively uncomplicated decision, but allowing EA to entire groups of patients for treatment with an investigational new drug presents more complex regulatory, logistical, and ethical challenges for scientists, commercial entities, and the FDA. The current regulatory process from IND filing to drug approval has evolved and includes not only the FDA\u2019s historical primary mission of ensuring patient safety, but also, since the latter half of the 20th century, the newer mission of ensuring that marketed drugs are actually efficacious for their advertised/approved use. EA for a single patient may not present much of a challenge to the assertion that a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh the risks, because as presumably the patient requesting compassionate use faces an otherwise dismal clinical future, taking even significant risks with a new drug still presents potential benefits to a patient without other options. Early in a drug\u2019s regulatory pathway, however, it is not usually possible to ensure that a drug has a reasonable risk/benefit ratio for all patients, including those in the early stages of disease.",

            "text": "Drug companies face bigger issues when the seeker of EA is a group of patients or an entire class of patients. Before marketing, manufacture of the drug for clinical studies is nearly an \u201call cost\u201d proposition for the commercial entity; the drug cannot be marketed to cover its costs. Thus, companies generally only manufacture sufficient quantities (plus a small margin) to cover the requirements of clinical studies, rather than devote resources to manufacturing large quantities of a drug which has a <10% chance of ever making it to market 1, 2. The FDA approval process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND). Making the drug available to groups or classes of patients who might then deplete the supply of drug for clinical studies could compromise the very research that would more completely disclose a drug\u2019s risks and benefits; thus, it could possibly impede full market approval that would make the drug more widely available.",

In 1984, Syntex Corporation (later integrated into the Roche group) was engaged in animal studies of ganciclovir when a physician requested the drug under a compassionate use agreement with the FDA to treat a young mother dying of CMV pneumonia (8). Unfortunately, the woman died despite treatment. CMV infection was emerging as the cause of death in up to 30% of patients with AIDS, attacking the retina, lungs, liver, brain, spinal cord, and intestines, and only a few weeks later another physician requested compassionate use of ganciclovir in a 41-year-old man with advanced AIDS who was going blind from CMV retinitis. Based on this second patient\u2019s dramatic and quantifiable improvement, Syntex decided they had an ethical obligation to provide the drug when requested, and developed a written protocol setting criteria of documented immunocompromise and CMV infection that was an immediate threat to life or sight (8). In 1986, a series of 26 patients who received the drug under compassionate use was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, documenting the first effective treatment for CMV infection (9). Later studies also showed that ganciclovir patients were living longer (10).",

But, because of ganciclovir\u2019s known efficacy, it became paradoxically impossible to carry out human controlled trials, because such trials are only ethically justifiable if investigators are honestly uncertain about whether net positive benefits over placebo exists (13).

AIDS advocates lobbied Congress for improved access to investigational drugs, and sit-ins began in protest.

In fact, when human birth defects began to appear in the offspring of women who had ingested thalidomide during pregnancy as a sedative and to treat nausea, researchers pointed out that thalidomide had failed to demonstrate teratogenicity in rats, and at first insisted that thalidomide could not be the culprit. In Germany, where the drug was first developed, thalidomide was held to be so safe that no prescription was required for its use, it was advertised for use in pregnant women (19), and the drug company distributed free samples to its factory employees 18, 19.",

In Dr. Kelsey\u2019s words, \u201cIt just so happened that my first application was for the drug thalidomide. I got this because I was new and they thought I should have an easy one to start on\u201d (19). Because of Dr. Kelsey\u2019s quick action, the United States largely escaped the tragedy of thalidomide, in contrast to other Western countries\u2014only 17 U.S. cases of thalidomide-related birth defects were ever reported (18). Globally, the first known case of a thalidomide-induced birth defect occurred when a baby girl, the daughter of an employee of the drug developer, was born without ears in Germany on Christmas day of 1956. The number of infants born with thalidomide-related deformities worldwide grew to over 10,000 cases (21). As a direct result of the thalidomide tragedy, the U.S. Congress was galvanized in 1962 to pass the Kefauver Harris Amendments to the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act to strengthen drug regulation in the United States 22, 23.",

Dr. Jacob Sheskin was treating a patient with leprosy whose pain was so great the patient could not sleep. He obtained permission to treat the patient with thalidomide, and found that the drug treatment also caused regression of the leprosy. With cautious support from the March of Dimes, one of the thalidomide victim advocacy groups, the FDA approved thalidomide for treatment of leprosy in 1998 24, 25. Until better drugs came along, thalidomide became the drug of choice in treating erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of leprosy (21). In 1992, on a different front, Dr. Robert D\u2019Amato was looking for a drug to treat macular degeneration. He discovered that thalidomide inhibited vascular proliferation and might be useful in this disorder (26). Although its use in macular degeneration was not ultimately satisfactory, the drug is now used to treat a number of other ailments: tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn\u2019s disease, human immunodeficiency virus, AIDS, and multiple myeloma 19, 20, 22.",

Thalidomide was given the most severe rating for drugs that contribute to fetal deformities, and for drugs whose risks outweigh possible benefits to patients. The STEPS program requires registration by both prescribing physicians and their patients, required proof of an initial negative pregnancy test prior to treatment of female patients, proof that the patient was using 2 forms of contraception, and submission of monthly pregnancy tests (27). Male patients are encouraged to use condoms during sexual intercourse because it is unknown whether thalidomide in semen is teratogenic. The STEPS program would later provide a framework for similar measures regarding isotretinoin, a drug used to treat severe acne, and also known to cause severe birth defects. Elsewhere in the world where the drug is not so well regulated, thalidomide birth defects are still reported (19). STEPS and the measures taken with isotretinoin are the forerunners of the modern REMS.",

Examples of such emergencies include epidemic outbreaks, bioterrorism attacks, chemical spills and attacks, and radiation and nuclear attacks. EUA is different from the emergency use of an investigational product under the EA program of the FDA, because an EUA requires the declaration of a public health emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Homeland Security. They can then request an EUA to permit the use of unapproved investigational drugs, or unapproved uses of approved medical products. An FDA workgroup then takes into account the availability, safety, and efficacy of the drug or biologic, weighed against the communicability, morbidity, and mortality of the public health threat in deciding whether to release the treatment. EUA does not require documentation of individual informed consent, although information about the product must be provided to health care providers and individual patients (31). The process for approval of an EUA is summarized in Figure 1\n(32). The first use of an EUA was in 2005, allowing the U.S. Department of Defense to provide anthrax vaccines to service members deployed in regions of the world subject to high threats for biological weapons. Other examples have included the use of diagnostic devices in the Zika outbreak of 2016.",

EUAs also raise particular questions of what role, if any, investigational drugs should play in a communicable disease outbreak (33). Communicable diseases often present urgent needs by patients, because outbreaks are usually acute in nature, with high transmissibility and potentially high community morbidity and mortality. Determining benefits and risks of an investigational drug or biologic in the setting of a public health crisis involves a certain amount of duress on investigators, health care providers, and patients, with limited time for a considered decision. Thus, EUAs may not be appropriate for drugs that are in very early-phase testing, where reasonable risk/benefit ratios are almost entirely unknown, and a potentially large number of subjects will be exposed to the drug. With regard to benefits, infectious disease emergencies also carry a unique consideration: treatment of an index patient has potential to both benefit the individual, but also the community at large, by containing the outbreak. Conditions for which there are current EUAs in effect are listed in Table 1\n(34).",

Over 1,700 people were sickened, and over 930 died. The World Health Organization knew of several vaccines and biologics that were in the pipeline to treat the Ebola virus, but none had been subjected to human studies, and the organization initially ruled out their use. Despite this, 2 U.S. citizens involved in epidemic response became ill with Ebola and were treated with an experimental mixture of monoclonal antibodies called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. and LeafBio [San Diego, California], Defyrus Inc. [Toronto, Ontario, Canada], the U.S. government and the Public Health Agency of Canada). Both patients survived (35). Their treatment resurrected debate about the use of untested drugs in such dire circumstances: the WHO convened a panel of ethicists to discuss whether treatments without prior in-human testing should be tried in circumstances where an epidemic had such a high fatality rate. With only 2 test cases, no scientific conclusions could be drawn about ZMapp\u2019s efficacy or safety 35, 36. The published report of the WHO set out considerations for when unregistered drugs could be used to treat Ebola, and principles regarding prioritizing those who should receive treatment, such as women and children (36). The fact that the treatment was made available to 2 U.S. citizens and not to Africans, who comprised most of its victims, engendered anger over the social justice of such decisions, providing, as Enserink (35) points out, a tragic validation to the satirical yet somewhat prophetic paper that had appeared in The Onion only weeks before titled \u201cExperts: Ebola vaccine at least 50 white people away\u201d (37).",

The ganciclovir saga, ZMapp, and other experiences raise the question of what to do when a potentially beneficial drug is needed that has not undergone any in-human testing, and furthermore cannot undergo such human studies due to ethical concerns. In 2015, the FDA released a guidance for industry to address \u201cdrugs developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances, when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible\u201d (38). Under certain conditions, the FDA may accept animal studies in lieu of human clinical trials, provided that there is reasonable expectation that the animal studies are predictive of in-human effects. Such conditions may apply not only to individual patient use, but potentially to widespread use during a public health emergency and must meet specific requirements (Table 2) (39). As of now, 12 products have been approved under the Animal Rule, 7 of which were issued quickly after the guidance was published (Table 3) (40). Approval via the Animal Rule is usually subject to several conditions: 1) post-marketing \u201cfield\u201d studies must verify and describe the product\u2019s clinical efficacy and safety when such studies are ethical and feasible; 2) restrictions may be imposed to ensure safe use only under the approved labelling (i.e., off-label use may be forbidden); and 3) information must be provided to patients prior to administration regarding the conditions of approval and directions for use, contraindications, foreseeable risks, adverse reactions, and drug interactions. The FDA provides guidance on product development under the Animal Rule, including general expectations and qualified animal models under FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research programs, as well as study design considerations (38).",
