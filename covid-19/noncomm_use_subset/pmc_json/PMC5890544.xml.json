            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are a global health concern caused by dozens of different types of viruses. The respiratory diseases resulting from these viral infections represent one of the main causes of death in developing countries.1 A more thorough understanding of respiratory viruses, their epidemiology, as well as medical impact on the communities they affect will delineate the path toward eventual treatments and future abatement of the illnesses. While symptoms of many respiratory viruses are similar, the viruses themselves are characteristically unique. Categorically, viruses are grouped based on similarities such as the nature of their nucleic acid genome, envelope presence, overall size, and even capsid uniformity.2 This review focuses on the following families of RNA viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Coronaviridae. Orthomyxoviridae comprise negative (\u2013) sense single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that are segmented, enveloped, and includes the influenza viruses (see Table 1). Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae are also (\u2013)ssRNA viruses, but are non-segmented and enveloped, and include parainfluenza virus (PIV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The Picornaviridae family, which contains positive (+)ssRNA viruses are non-enveloped; the key members include the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Lastly, the Coronaviridae are (+)ssRNA enveloped viruses, which include, chiefly, human coronavirus (HCoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV.3 Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In a 10-year study, over 85% of acute respiratory viral infections in critically ill children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit were caused by either a picornavirus, RSV, PIV, or HMPV (see Figure 1).4 Other DNA viruses such as adenovirus can be the source of respiratory infections but will not be discussed here.",

Influenza A and B contain hemagglutinin and neuraminidase envelope glycoproteins. Influenza C and D have a single surface glycoprotein called the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein.6,7 Antigenic variation in these glycoproteins results in limited vaccine protection. Influenza, or the flu, presents with symptoms such as headache, cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, and chills.8 Generally, the flu lasts from 5 days to 2 weeks and the severity of infection is determined by the host. The highest incidence of influenza infection occurs in younger patients (<25 years old) where a shorter infection is typical, while those at risk for longer and more severe illness and complications associated with infection are the pediatric (<2 years old) and geriatric populations (>65 years old), pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals.9,10 It is estimated that 3\u20135 million cases of the flu occur annually around the globe, with a quarter to half million deaths resulting from these illnesses.11",

Symptoms include runny nose, nasal inflammation, cough, sore throat, low-grade fever, wheezing, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.20 Current estimates in developing and industrialized countries suggest as many as 33 million cases of RSV worldwide in the pediatric population less than 5 years old, 10% of which require hospitalization, and 2% to 18% of hospitalized cases result in mortality.

CoV 229E and OC43 are both pathogens associated with the common cold, but can cause pneumonia as well.34 HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 infection show similar clinical features to those in patients with 229E and OC43, but clinicians have also reported bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia in infected individuals.35,36 The first CoV recognized as pandemic threat is SARS-CoV. SARS was discovered in 2002\u20132003 after a perplexing epidemic of pneumonia among hospital workers in China.37 By the end of its global epidemic, SARS disseminated to 29 countries, infecting over 8000 individuals, and killing roughly 10% of those infected.38 Roughly a decade later, a similar pattern occurred with MERS, which began in 2012 in Jordan with an outbreak of a respiratory illness among hospital workers, one of whom died of the infection. Later that year, a man with pneumonia and multiple organ failure in Saudi Arabia was found to have the MERS pathogen.39 Adults are the target population for both SARS and MERS with a median age range of 39\u201350 years; MERS occurs predominantly in men whereas SARS does not. The clinical features of both SARS and MERS range from mild to severe respiratory illness, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, and diarrhea, with the latter displaying a more lethal pneumonia and renal failure.40,41 Even worse than SARS mortality, retrospective analysis has shown that of the 2040 confirmed cases of MERS, 35% were fatal.42",

In the past 15 years, multiple nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have been developed as direct-acting agents against RNA virus infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), but have not yet been successfully applied to acute infections caused by respiratory viruses. Only a handful of non-nucleoside drugs have been developed for the treatment and prevention of these viruses. Such drugs include the FDA approved oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir for influenza virus infection, palivizumab for RSV prevention, as well as the two discontinued clinical candidates targeting rhinovirus, pleconaril and rupintrivir. These molecules possess limitations preventing their widespread use, such as short therapeutic window and risk of resistance selection for the neuraminidase inhibitors, and only partial protection associated with prophylactic use for palivizumab.

Both properties are best explained by the mechanism of action common to most antiviral nucleosides: targeting viral polymerases.43 After being metabolized by host kinases to their triphosphate form, antiviral nucleotides compete with natural nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to bind to the active site of viral polymerases and alter DNA or RNA synthesis. The nucleotide binding site of these proteins is usually well conserved among virus families and any changes in neighboring amino acids often comes at a cost for the enzyme and the virus.

These are non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), matrix protein M1 and ion channel protein M2, polymerase acidic (PA) protein, polymerase basic protein (PB1), polymerase basic protein 1-F2, polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA).44 Some viruses express the PB1-N40 protein. All four species of influenza adopt similar arrangements with the viral genomic segments forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with one heterotrimeric polymerase. Influenza A polymerase is composed of three subunits that yield a 270 kDa heterotrimeric complex. The longest viral RNA segments encode for the PA protein, PB1, and PB2, which assemble to form the influenza polymerase complex (see Figure 2).45 The three subunits interact noncovalently to exert their polymerase activity. The polymerase transcribes viral RNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then replicates it using a complementary RNA intermediate.5 The process of transcription includes cap snatching, where short-capped cellular RNA are bound by the PB2 subunit, cleaved from the PA endonuclease domain, and then utilized for priming mRNA synthesis by the PB1 domain.46\u201351",

A signature structural element is the conserved P[F/P]AAAPP motif on the N-terminal side of the 627 residue that is part of the alpha helix previously described.53 Mutation of the P620 or F621 residue significantly decreased the ability of the virus to replicate, presumably by causing a slight kink in the alpha helix that alters the polymerase function. The exact role of the PB2 627 domain remains unclear, but recent evidence suggests it is not necessary for in vitro binding and transcription of viral RNA; this has not been proven true in a cell-based format.54",

This GDP then serves as a nucleophile to attack the pRNA and results in the release of the GpppRNA.58 The second part of the reaction consists of the MTase reaction, which uses S-adenosylmethionine to methylate nitrogen 7 and the 2\u2032-oxygen of the cap.",

This important proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated that 2\u2032-methyl nucleosides prevent picornavirus replication, most likely by inhibiting the viral RNA polymerase function. This class effect was confirmed with NITD008, another adenosine analog containing a 2\u2032-C-ethynyl on its 2\u2032-ribose (Figure 5).

Indeed, NITD008 blocks the replication of EV71, another enterovirus-related to rhinovirus.124 This in vitro antiviral effect was confirmed in a separate study that also demonstrated in vivo efficacy.125 Investigators in the latter study infected 2-week-old AG129 immunocompromised mice with EV71 by intraperitoneal inoculation.

In vitro, 2\u2032FdG inhibits influenza A virus replication with an EC50 of about 20 \u00b5M, without causing apparent cell toxicity.127 In ferrets, treatment with 2\u2032FdG at 20 mg/kg starting 1 h post-infection significantly reduced H3N2 influenza A virus titers in nasal washes, associated with reduction in fever and inflammation.128 Although time-of-addition experiments suggested that the molecule inhibits an early step of virus replication, more direct evidence for the mechanism of action came from enzyme inhibition studies.129 In cell-free transcription experiments, 2\u2032FdG triphosphate inhibited influenza A virus RNA polymerase activity by competing with natural GTP. The inhibition of the enzyme was caused by the incorporation of 2\u2032FdG monophosphate into the viral RNA.129 More recently, the related nucleoside analog 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro cytidine (2\u2032FdC) was evaluated against the highly pathogenic H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1 strains.130 When administered intraperitoneally, 2\u2032FdC significantly enhanced survival of BALB/c mice infected with a lethal dose of either H5N1 or H1N1 viruses. Although these studies show compelling evidence of in vivo efficacy in preclinical species, 2\u2032FdG and 2\u2032FdC are not suitable candidates for clinical development. One of the main limitations of these molecules is their lack of specificity for influenza virus polymerase. The ability of a nucleotide to inhibit distant molecular targets is not detrimental per se. As such, 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro nucleotides and their derivatives interact with the RNA polymerase of HCV.131\u2013134 But the substitution of the 2\u2032-hydroxy by a fluoro group also makes the resulting nucleotides broad substrates for viral135 and human136 DNA polymerases. In the latter study, the authors have shown that the monophosphate form of both 2\u2032FdC and 2\u2032FdG can be incorporated into DNA by human DNA polymerase alpha and gamma. This might explain the changes in cell cycle distribution and cytostatic effect caused by prolonged in vitro incubation with 2\u2032FdC.133 Paradoxically, the same molecule was well tolerated when administered intravenously to rats and woodchucks for up to 90 days.137 One hypothesis for this discrepancy is that a low organ exposure of the phosphorylated metabolite(s) of 2\u2032FdC could limit the toxic effect on dividing cells in these animals.",

T-705 is a nucleoside precursor inhibiting influenza virus with broad-strain coverage137,139 (Figure 5). It is often proposed that T-705 exerts its antiviral activity through its NTP form (T-705 RTP) by directly inhibiting the RdRp activity of influenza A virus polymerase,140 but the exact mode of action and precise molecular interaction between the nucleotide and the viral polymerase has been elusive. In vitro, T-705 is efficiently converted to its ribofuranosyl 5\u2032-triphosphate (T-705 RTP) form by cellular enzymes.141 Treatment of influenza A virus-infected cells with T-705 results in a significant increase of lethal mutations within the viral genome, a phenomenon also described as error catastrophe.142 The lethal mutagenesis hypothesis is supported by enzymatic assays showing that T-705 RTP is efficiently recognized by influenza A virus polymerase both as a guanosine and an adenosine analog.143 In addition, single events of T-705 RMP incorporation into RNA by influenza A virus polymerase delayed but did not block the extension of the RNA primer strand. The antiviral potency of T-705 covers other virus families well beyond orthomyxoviruses. T-705 has been shown to inhibit a number of diverse RNA viruses unrelated to influenza, including representatives of noroviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, and filoviruses.144\u2013152 It is interesting to point out that the mutagenic effect of T-705 has also been documented for HCV.153 At the biochemical level, we showed that T-705 is recognized as substrate for RNA synthesis not only by viral polymerases, but also by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.154,155 This host-based interaction did not result in any measurable in vitro mitochondrial toxicity, but it raised more questions about the mechanism of action of the compound. Recently, the possibility that T-705 exerts its main antiviral effect without converting to its triphosphate form came from the observation that T-705 ribonucleoside is chemically unstable under biological conditions.156 Even though T-705 does not seem to potently inhibit the human IMPDH enzyme,157 its very broad antiviral spectrum and its capacity to induce lethal mutagenesis are somewhat reminiscent of ribavirin, another nucleoside that inhibits HCV replication through host-based mechanisms. Therefore, the possibility that T-705 exerts its inhibition through interactions with host proteins cannot be ruled out and remains to be further explored. Considering its similarities with ribavirin in terms of antiviral spectrum and mode of action, it will be interesting to see if T-705 becomes more widely used in patients suffering from respiratory viral infections, or if it will remain limited to stockpiling for potential influenza pandemic in Japan.",

Further modifications at the 2\u2032- and 4\u2032- positions to improve anti-RSV potency and selectivity, led to the identification of ALS-8112 (2\u2032fluoro-4\u2032chloromethyl-cytidine) (Figure 5). In vitro, ALS-8112 inhibits a broad panel of RSV A and B subtypes, as well as related pneumo-, paramyxo-, and rhabdoviruses.159 In particular, we recently reported that ALS-8112 inhibits RSV and HMPV with similar in vitro potency.160 The molecular target of ALS-8112 was determined by two independent methods. The polymerization function of the RSV L protein was identified as the target of ALS-8112 inhibition, first, by selecting and characterizing drug resistance-associated mutations located in the L gene. When introduced into a wild-type RSV genome, four amino acid mutations (M628L, A789V, L795I, and I796V) were phenotypically associated with resistance to ALS-8112.159 Enzymatic assays using purified recombinant RSV polymerase were critical to validate the mode of action of ALS-8112. In these assays, the 5\u2032-triphosphate form of ALS-8112 (ALS-8112-TP) caused immediate chain termination of RNA synthesis and inhibition of the viral polymerization activity. This inhibitory effect was specific to RSV polymerase, since ALS-8112-TP did not inhibit polymerases from host or viruses unrelated to RSV such as HCV. The lack of inhibition against HCV was rationalized by molecular modeling, predicting steric clashing of ALS-8112-TP inside the active site of HCV polymerase. Because of the low oral bioavailability of ALS-8112, a series of 2\u2032,3\u2032-diester prodrugs was evaluated for improved pharmacokinetic properties. One prodrug, ALS-8176, formed high levels of monophosphate and triphosphate in the lungs when administered orally to nonhuman primates. Because of its high oral bioavailability, ALS-8176 was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in African green monkeys infected with RSV. At the end of treatment, RSV RNA was undetectable in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from all four ALS-8176-treated animals.159 Subsequently, a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial evaluated ALS-8176 given for 5 days to healthy adults inoculated with RSV.161 The reduction in viral load in nasal washes associated with ALS-8176 treatment varied from 73% to 88% depending on the dose regimen. RSV RNA was undetectable 1.3 to 2.3 days after the start of ALS-8176 treatment compared with 7.2 days for placebo. Assessment of symptom scores and quantity of mucus produced also showed a clear effect on RSV-induced disease. This important result represents the first proof-of-concept validation that an RSV replication inhibitor can be efficacious in humans. ALS-8176 is currently in clinical development for the treatment of RSV infection in hospitalized infants and adults (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02202356, NCT02935673).",

As a result, the development of a new series of C-linked nucleoside analogs with anti-Ebola properties was soon reported.162 In a cell-based infectious assay, the 1\u2032-cyano C-linked adenosine derivative (GS-441524, or compound 4) was moderately active against Ebola replication with EC50 values around 1.5 \u00b5M, whereas the 1\u2032-methyl and -ethynyl counterparts were completely inactive. GS-441524 is also a broad-spectrum inhibitor of a variety of RNA viruses from four families (Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Pneumoviridae), including HCV and RSV.163,164 However, the addition of a 2\u2032-C-methyl group, as in the case of the GS-6620,165,166 significantly reduces the antiviral spectrum to HCV only. The relatively weak antiviral activity of GS-441524 across all viruses (0.5\u201350 \u00b5M EC50) was attributed to its inefficient intracellular phosphorylation, which could be improved by adding a monophosphate prodrug to the parent nucleoside. The resulting compound, GS-5734 (Figure 5) inhibits the Zaire and Sudan species of Ebola virus and Marburg virus with EC50 values ranging from 0.01 to 0.20 \u00b5M, and exhibits moderate cytotoxicity (CC50 = 2 to >20 \u00b5M) in multiple human cell types. GS-5734 exhibits the same broad antiviral spectrum as its parent molecule.163 The triphosphate form of GS-5734 is recognized as substrate by RSV polymerase, but its incorporation into RNA does not lead to immediate chain termination.162 The favorable in vitro data led to further evaluation of GS-5734 in a macaque lethal model of Ebola virus disease. Complete protection was achieved when GS-5734 was administered at a daily intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg, beginning on Day 3 post-infection.162 Following Phase I safety testing in healthy human volunteers, GS-5724 was first given as a 14-day course for compassionate use to an Ebola-infected nurse who had survived the disease and developed a recurrence in the central nervous system.167 Soon after, a neonate who had congenital Ebola virus infection received three different experimental therapies, including a 12-day treatment with GS-5734.168 In both cases, patients cleared the virus and survived the infection.",

It was shown that GS-5734 inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with sub-micromolar EC50 values.169 GS-5734 was also effective against other human and bat CoV. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. Although there is limited data to confirm the proposed mechanism of action of GS-5734 against each virus, it is generally assumed that the molecule targets the RdRp function of the viral polymerase. In the case of CoV, this is supported by the identification of two mutations (F476L and V553L) within the predicted fingers subdomain of the RdRp protein nsp12 from murine hepatitis virus.170 These mutations emerged over 23 passages and confer 4- to 6-fold resistance to GS-5734, combined with overall reduced replication fitness. At this point, the precise mechanism of action of GS-5734 against CoV remains elusive. It is possible that GS-5734 triphosphate is not excised by the proofreading activity of nsp14 because of lack of immediate chain termination, as observed for RSV polymerase. In this case, could the resistance mutations identified in nsp12 alter the chain termination profile of GS-5734, and make it more susceptible to excision? Such studies are needed, not only to understand how GS-5734 works but also to design new molecules against CoV polymerases.",

            "text": "What are the molecular determinants of polymerase selectivity against nucleotide analogs? We currently do not understand well how specific changes made in nucleotide analogs alter their recognition as substrates for RNA synthesis, and how substrate selectivity differs among positive and negative strand RNA virus polymerases. For example, many 2\u2032-modified nucleotide analogs are known to inhibit HCV polymerase, often with an antiviral spectrum extended to flaviviruses and picornaviruses. However, there is no clear mechanistic basis to explain why none of these compounds inhibit (\u2013)ssRNA viruses, or even other (+)ssRNA viruses such as CoV. Could the exonuclease/proofreading activity of CoV polymerases excise chain terminators and resume RNA synthesis? Are there specific amino acid within the active site of (\u2013)ssRNA virus polymerases responsible for the discrimination of 2\u2032-C-methyl nucleotides? These hypotheses have not been tested, in part, due to the difficulty to conduct biochemical and structural studies on viral polymerases from respiratory viruses. Until recently, the production of soluble, pure viral protein targets has been limiting, especially in the case of large protein complexes. As mentioned earlier in this review, the development of robust expression systems for influenza polymerase trimer, as an example, have made it possible to use X-ray crystallography and potentially cryo-electron microscopy to provide molecular visualization of binding pockets for small molecule inhibitors, entry and exit channels for substrate(s), and potential new ways to disrupt domain interactions. These structural insights will tremendously aid the development of new drugs as well as to further elucidate the mechanisms of action and binding of existing drugs to their protein targets. Molecular modeling is also a useful approach that we and others have used to rationalize the differences in selectivity of lumicitabine against RSV and HCV polymerase.159 More studies such as these ones will be needed to rationally design new nucleotide analogs targeting respiratory virus polymerases.",

In the context of acute respiratory infections, evaluation of safety must be based on both the intended duration of treatment and the targeted patients, which sometimes include vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Other considerations to ensure successful future development of nucleoside analogs directed against respiratory infections will be to optimize delivery to the lung by evaluating different routes of administrations, including aerosol formulations, and developing lung-targeting nucleoside prodrugs. Despite these challenges, the prospect of developing nucleoside analogs directed against respiratory RNA virus infections represents an exciting new avenue in antiviral research.",
