More than 70% of these infections are zoonotic 1, 2, entering either directly from wildlife reservoirs or indirectly via an intermediate domestic animal host 1, 3. HIV, avian influenza, Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, Lassa virus (LASV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) viruses are all examples of zoonoses currently emerging from wildlife. All these emerging zoonoses present a serious and increasing threat to health, biosecurity and economies worldwide. The mechanisms underlying disease transmission from animals to humans are becoming better understood 4 with the emergence of pathogens from wildlife (which represents the greatest threat to global health) occurring in a non\u2010uniform pattern, being localized to distinct geographic \u2018hotspots\u2019 in Africa, Asia and South America, and with each high\u2010threat pathogen being weighted towards a key wildlife species (e.g. bats, rodents or non\u2010human primates (NHPs). It is clear that such diseases will continue to place a substantial burden on global health, especially in dense human populations where the pressures on environmental and economic resources are greatest. More than one billion cases of human zoonotic disease are estimated to occur annually, and emerging zoonoses result in enormous economic losses 5. Increased urbanization, international travel, commerce and climate change increase the likelihood that emerging zoonosis will continue, if not worsen, in the future.",

            "text": "When a zoonotic virus spills over into a susceptible new species, it often has the advantage that the new host has little or no pre\u2010existing immunity, enabling attachment, entry and replication of the virus in receptive cells. The amplified virus may then evade clearance by host defences for long enough to be transmitted to another susceptible host, and the lack of herd immunity will result in a rapid dissemination of the virus, leading to disease in more virulent cases of infection. Each step in the process represents an opportunity for vaccine\u2010induced immunity and, through such intervention, transmitters and susceptible hosts are removed from a population by the pre\u2010emptive development of protective immunity, so that the spread of infection becomes less likely. Vaccination is therefore a powerful strategy for preventing and controlling emerging zoonotic infectious disease. The development of vaccines for such emerging infections, however, needs to contend with several key challenges associated with such viruses. An emerging infection may be a recently discovered virus and the result of a rare outbreak for which basic biological information such as correlates of protection, antigenic variability or immunodominance are unknown. There may be a lack of time to develop an appropriate animal model of disease in which to study viral immunology and evaluate vaccine candidates for preclinical assessment of protective efficacy and safety. Additionally, many emerging viruses have high case fatality rates, spread easily and cannot be treated. These characteristics mandate that all experimental investigations with such infectious material be carried out at high levels of bio\u2010safety, such as BioSafety levels 3 or 4. For such pathogens the availability of resource\u2010heavy laboratory infrastructure is a bottleneck to basic research. Moreover, the often standard vaccine approach of using attenuated strains or inactivated viral vaccines is not always a feasible option, because of the possibility of reversion to virulence or the requirement for large\u2010scale culture and production in high containment facilities. In addition to these significant hurdles, the economic cost of novel human vaccine development for rare pathogens, which are unlikely to provide an effective payback on investment, has been a major impediment to progress. Thus, basic research into many emerging pathogens has been neglected for years.",

Based on the utility of the vaccine, an infectious cDNA clone of the YF17D virus 20 has enabled the development of a 17D platform that can be used to drive antigen delivery of pathogens of interest 21. The technology (licenced as ChimeriVax\u2122) is well suited to similarly related flaviviruses and successful recombinants have been constructed, involving a simple swap of the PrM/M\u2010E genes of YF17D for the same membrane envelope antigens of other emerging flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, Dengue and West Nile. The resulting recombinant vaccines are efficiently delivered in a live\u2010attenuated virus context with the safety profile afforded by the 17D non\u2010structural genes 22.

For example, a new vaccine candidate for RVFV has been developed in which a viral virulence factor has been deleted, resulting in a highly attenuated but immunogenic replicating virus 23. A similar recombinant approach has been used to attenuate the emerging and neglected pathogen Mayaro virus (MAYV) by swapping the subgenomic promoter of this alphavirus for an internal ribosome entry site 24, 25, which reduces the expression of MAYV structural proteins. While this arrangement makes the virus unable to infect mosquito cells, replication in mammalian cells is still possible, resulting in a highly immunogenic profile. Similar studies on infectious clones of other viruses 26 have demonstrated that the genomewide de\u2010optimization of codon usage dramatically reduces gene expression and can be used to attenuate otherwise pathogenic viruses. This strategy has been used for the prototype arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 27; the study showed attenuation in an otherwise fatal mouse model of LCM disease and the ability to induce protective immunity. Together with a maintained and robust ability to multiply in cell culture, this live attenuated approach may be suitable for similar viruses. However, work to underpin confidence in the genetic stability of such attenuated viruses is critical before further consideration can be given to using this approach for clinical intervention, especially considering the inherent high error rates of the arenavirus polymerase.",

Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional vaccinia vaccines 31, 32. Adapted to growth in avian cells, MVA does not replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the viral immune evasion genes 33. The features of MVA, such as its capacity to accommodate large gene inserts 34, thermostability for application in remote regions without an established cold chain 35, ease of inexpensive manufacture to GMP standards and established regulatory package for development as an Investigational New Drug, make the recombinant MVA platform 36 highly versatile as a heterologous viral vector. In the context of emerging infections, the recombinant MVA platform has shown encouraging preclinical efficacy against Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya 37 and CCHF 38 viruses. Additionally, MVA elicits a strong immunological response against a range of other orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) (including Variola), and vaccines based on this platform can be considered as providing added value, as human immunity to OPXVs is low (after the cessation of the smallpox vaccination campaign) opening a gap for OPXV emergence, as evidenced by the recent occurrence of monkeypox virus in West Africa and onward cross boarder transmissions 39, 40.",

Driven by autonomous RNA replication, RNA replicons result in high\u2010level, cytosolic expression of recombinant heterologous antigens stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system.

While a series of different vaccine replicon systems are available, new capabilities with negative\u2010strand viruses have opened up opportunities against a wider range of emerging viruses. Recent developments 44 include the construction of LASV replicons packaged into LASV\u2010like particles which allow a single round of replication and are able to confer protection against an otherwise lethal challenge of LASV in a guinea pig model of disease 44. While recombinant replicons are devoid of the viral glycoprotein gene, its incorporation into VLPs is achieved by the use of a cell line that expresses the glycoprotein separately (in trans). This enables the scalable propagation of replicon particles in a way that aims to combine the safety of replicon\u2010delivered LASV antigens with the convenience of simply and rapidly producing an attenuated virus.

They induce strong B cell responses in the absence of adjuvants by efficiently cross\u2010linking specific receptors on B cells 47, and they can also trigger T cell\u2010mediated responses 48. The basis of ordered viral self\u2010assembly from protein subunits that is noted in many different virus families provides the foundation for work with VLPs, with more than 30 different viruses that infect humans or other animals being identified as able to produce VLPs. They are structurally diverse, having single or multiple capsid proteins, or a lipid envelope, although not all viruses are suitable VLP candidates. Those which are can elicit a protective response without requiring multiple booster shoots, thus significantly reducing the vaccine costs.

Furthermore, antigen is expressed in vivo and induces both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immune responses. Additionally, large quantities of DNA can be produced in a short time at reduced cost, and DNA preparations are more stable than other types of vaccines, which are desirable properties for a vaccine that may be used in remote areas. Furthermore, DNA vaccines are considered safe. However, the main limitation in the development of DNA vaccines is their intrinsic low immunogenicity.

Replication competent but attenuated virus vectors (RHS) deliver heterologous antigen targets resulting in the induction of cellular and humoral responses. Their complement of genes enables a full round of replication and assembly of progeny virus which can amplify and spread the vaccine effect to susceptible cells. While these platforms are based on highly attenuated viral backgrounds, replication competence may lead to the development of mutations and reversion to virulence. Replication defective vectors (LHS) support effective cellular entry and a single round of expression of the target gene / antigen; they result in effective induction of cellular and humoral responses. They are unable to generate new infectious progeny and are considered safer than replication competent vectors.",
