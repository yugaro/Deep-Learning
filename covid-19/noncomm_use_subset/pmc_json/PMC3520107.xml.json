Although the IOM report was influential in thrusting the issue of EIDs squarely into scientific and public discourse, the awareness that diseases periodically emerge and reemerge actually goes back millennia (2, 3). For example, ancient Greek, Roman, and Persian writers documented the emergence of many new epidemics. During and after the 14th-century \u201cBlack Death\u201d pandemic of bubonic/pneumonic plague, European city officials quarantined arriving ships to prevent its importation and set up quarantine stations to isolate and care for patients. In 1685, the scientist Robert Boyle presciently observed that \u201cthere are ever new forms of epidemic diseases appearing\u2026among [them] the emergent variety of exotick and hurtful\u2026\u201d (4, 5).",

These advances spurred optimistic predictions that infections would soon be conquered (7), and physicians and public health workers began to lose sight of the possibility of the emergence of new and previously unrecognized infectious diseases. To a large extent, it was the shock of the recognition of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s, followed by the IOM report of 1992, that rekindled awareness of, and interest in, EIDs. Two decades after the IOM report, it is appropriate to ask what has been learned about EIDs, where have we succeeded or failed in our efforts to fight them, and what challenges remain.",

For example, both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health released EID research and response plans (9, 10). In 1995, the CDC established an EID-oriented scientific journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases. Now in its 18th year, the journal has published nearly 10,000 articles and has become standard reading for many in the disciplines of microbiology, clinical infectious diseases, public health, and allied medical fields. Other microbiology and general medical journals emphasizing EIDs have been established, e.g., PLoS Pathogens, or expanded their coverage of EIDs, e.g., the Journal of Infectious Diseases and Vaccine, while mBio and other journals published by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) have remained leaders in publishing important EID-related research.",

Genomics and proteomics have helped in the discovery of new infectious diseases and in acquiring a better understanding of the pathogenesis of existing ones; have substantially improved surveillance, diagnosis, and drug and vaccine design; and promise to help elucidate host susceptibility factors and host responses to treatment of infections. For example, by 2003, the genomes of the human species, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum all had been sequenced, representing the first time that all the major actors in the drama of an important emerging/reemerging infectious disease had been characterized at the molecular genetic level (12, 14). These breakthroughs are important additions to our continuing efforts to control malaria, which have had recent successes but still require new countermeasures. These genomic data are contributing to vaccine and drug development and are elucidating the pathogenesis of and human resistance and susceptibility to malaria (14).",

Dawkins contended that the visible evidence of genomic survival is an organism\u2019s expressed phenotype, its \u201csurvival machine,\u201d which is akin to a simple virus being protected by its external protein coat; however, Dawkins proposed that we should think of natural selection as operating at the level of the gene, not the organism it encodes.",

For example, HIV/AIDS, influenza, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, measles, plague, smallpox, and possibly even leprosy are directly or primarily of animal origin. Viral host switching, in some cases associated with rapid and complicated microbial comutations (23), has become an important research topic (23, 24) for both newer EIDs, such as SARS, and reemerging ones, such as influenza. The processes by which animal-adapted microorganisms leave their hosts and adapt to new species, such as humans, are largely unknown and represent an important challenge in the study of EIDs.",

Although that pandemic occurred 15 years before influenza viruses were first identified, recent sequencing efforts from RNA in preserved tissues allowed full reconstruction of the 1918 pandemic viral genome, leading to a remarkable body of ongoing research and a greater understanding of how influenza viruses continue to emerge among humans and other animal species (27, 28).",

Strikingly, paleovirus oncogenes have even been resurrected and studied in infectivity assays to find the original cellular receptors to which they had become adapted millions of years ago (30). Both traditional historical research and study of phylogenetic trees derived from gene sequencing of modern organisms have added significantly to these efforts, leading, for example, to the discovery that the initial jump of what became known as HIV from nonhuman primates to humans probably occurred nearly a century ago with multiple independent host-switching events that ultimately led to the pandemic that was first recognized in 1981 (31). Understanding the history and evolution of emerging microbes allows us to predict more accurately what their potential pandemic impact will be, and to understand how we can best prevent and control them.",
