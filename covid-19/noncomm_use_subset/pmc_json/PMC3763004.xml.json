First, it enhances learning by providing associations that facilitate memory storage, retention, and retrieval: the knowledge is more meaningful. Second, it also helps motivate learning. Cases convey that the knowledge is relevant or useful, sometimes by showing its human dimension. Such contextual and human connections seem especially important (in today's culture) in fostering interest among women/girls and minorities, as well as among nonmajors. Such benefits indicate a vital role for careful selection of cases to fit particular groups of students, their contexts (age, locality, culture), interests, and levels of background knowledge.",

That is, the formal structure of a substantial domain of knowledge may not be evident when knowledge is accumulated by piecemeal sampling. (For example, a case profiling only a few organelles in the cell may eclipse awareness of the full diversity of organelles. A focus on just the nitrogen cycle alone may forsake a broader awareness of other mineral cycles and their general role in ecosystems.) Nevertheless, a carefully constructed curriculum may use complementary cases to cover standard curricular content (see Schwartz et al., 1997). On the other hand, some evidence indicates that learning occurs primarily, or most vividly, through exemplars (Kolodner et al., 1996; Gentner et al., 2003; Gentner and Colhoun, 2008). One case or example serves as a model, or paradigm, for interpreting other similar cases (Kuhn, 1970, pp. 23, 187\u2013191). A well-articulated sample may be as valuable as comprehensive coverage.",

These embody the rationale for learning, which is elsewise typically based solely on the authority of the instructor (or, by default, a textbook). Typically, such problems are rooted in cases (although they need not be, or the case itself may be quite minimalistic). Not all CBL is problem based, however. Cases may function merely as narratives, or as a setting for knowledge. This may be so even when a story (say, the case of an important historical discovery) helps students learn how a scientist encountered and solved a problem.",

Active learning\u2014itself expressed in various ways\u2014is widely recognized as enhancing motivation and depth and persistence of learning (Bonwell and Eison, 1991; Michael, 2006; see section on autonomy below). The introduction of cogent problems thus tends to amplify the basic virtues of using cases themselves\u2014provided the problems are framed in ways relevant to the student. Almost any declarative knowledge can be rephrased as a question or problem. However, just as a case should be judiciously selected, a problem should be properly framed and contextualized if it is indeed to be motivational. The teacher who begins, without context, \u201cToday we study the pancreas; now, what is a pancreas?,\u201d does not engage student interest. Indeed, students can easily spot a rhetorical problem or pseudoproblem. \u201cCookbook\u201d problems are just like cookbook labs. A teacher who needs to institute substantial external motivators for students to complete work, for example, has probably not found the proper problem to inspire active, student-centered learning. One may consider framing and contextualizing problems as one of the primary instructional skills for this mode of teaching.",

In a widely used model (Barrows, 1986), the problem is considered primarily a vehicle for learning content, which ultimately answers the given question or solves the problem at hand. In other cases, the problem engages students in practicing or developing problem-solving skills through firsthand experience. (Here, one should plan on providing a framework for students to learn new skills, not just exercise existing abilities.) Both styles, appropriately adapted, may also help foster deeper understanding of the nature of science (or of scientific practice, how science works, or the context of science broadly speaking). However, learning about the nature of science should be both explicit and reflective (Craven, 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004; Scharmann et al., 2005; Seker and Welsh, 2005). That is, one should pose problems specifically about the nature of science and engage students in discussion. These three aims are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

They convey that science is happening now, affording a sense of immediacy or authenticity (Wong et al., 2008). Students may even encounter some cases in the news (relevant just to the degree that students seriously attend to current events). Current problem cases that focus on the context of science can offer rehearsals for participating in personal decision making or social policy in future life. However, care should be taken in such cases to enrich the learning rather than merely elicit and reinforce existing perspectives. Ironically, evaluating the epistemic process in such cases is problematic. One needs time to know whether a proposed solution ultimately turned out to be reliable or well considered.",

First, the benchmark content knowledge in standard science curricula originated long ago. The strategic pedadgogical constructivist will thus look to history for clues about how such concepts may be constructed from earlier facts and perspectives, as well as how they may be alternatively conceived or criticized. Imagine the sense of validation when informing a student that the concept he or she just developed is the same concept discovered earlier by a famous scientist! Second, historical narratives are prime opportunities for teaching about scientific practice, because historians are able to render the historical context, bringing together experimental details with cultural events and perspectives and scientific disputes.

Here, the instructional goal is to guide students in learning discursive skills, such as active listening, that contribute to such social-level analysis. Even criticism may have a positive role, exposing weak assumptions or increasing rigor of evidence. Tolerating criticism may an emotional or attitudinal skill, but it seems to have epistemic value. In yet other cases, in which interpretations conflict, students may learn skills in negotiating solutions or finding creative ways to accommodate apparently incompatible views (Fisher et al., 1991). Thus, CBL or PBL may adopt the familiar forms of a debate or role-play simulation (for well-developed complex examples, see Dunn et al. [2009] on Darwin and the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1862; Allchin [2009a] on Galileo's trial in 1633; Allchin [2009b] on a presidential commission on pesticides in 1963; and Montgomery [2010] on glacial geology in 1843). Designated roles provide students a concrete perspective for interpreting a case or problem, which can serve as additional grounding. Unfamiliar roles (or sides in a debate) can also enhance appreciation of alternative perspectives. Even when students continue to work primarily on their own, however, one may still find a fruitful learning role for an exchange of multiple perspectives.",

First, vignettes or short stories focus on one relatively narrow question or problem. They can be easily inserted in a lecture format, say. But they are also limited. They convey that science and problem solving is easy and reductionistic. Second, lessons might extend over a full class period, as one activity or a series of short, related problems. Finally, one may use major projects that extend over several class periods, weeks, or the bulk of a semester if the complexity of the problem allows. For examples of the latter, see White (1992) on hemoglobin in biochemistry, Tewksbury (1999) on geology and the Aswan Dam, or Klassen (2006) on electrodynamics and the transatlantic cable. To the degree that science is complex and that education implicitly frames expectations beyond the classroom, teachers may well be encouraged to include some complex case studies or problems at some point in their courses as an indication of the real world and as an occasion for developing interpretive and organizational skills appropriate to such situations. One may also structure a series of lessons through a lineage of problems\u2014as is frequently already done in teaching transmission genetics, atomic models, or the wave/particle nature of light (for example, the biology text by Mix et al. [1996] is organized on this principle).",
