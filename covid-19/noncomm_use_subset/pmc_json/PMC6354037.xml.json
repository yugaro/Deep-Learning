In a 4-year survey in Hong Kong, more than 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illness, and 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem [20]. In addition, a cohort study that investigated psychiatric complications among SARS survivors 30 months after infection found that the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder was 33.3%; 25.6% of patients had PTSD and 15.6% had depressive disorders [21]. Moreover, MERS survivors shared similar psychopathologies as other disaster survivors [22] who reported varying rates of PTSD (30\u201340%) [23], depression (25%), and fatigue symptoms (50%).

It is noteworthy that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) shares many symptoms with depression and the two are frequently co-diagnosed [24]. However, according to the study which measure the fatigue severity among patients with multiple sclerosis, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and healthy adults, fatigue was largely independent of self-reported depressive symptoms [11].
