Public health\nagencies have begun to use REDCap to manage disease outbreak data. In addition to\nsurvey and database development, and data management and analysis, REDCap allows\nusers to track data manipulation and user activity, automate export procedures for\ndata downloads, and use ad hoc reporting tools and advanced features, such as\nbranching logic, file uploading, and calculated fields. REDCap supports HIPAA\ncompliance through user- based permissions and audit trails. These additional\ncapabilities may provide an advantage over commonly used outbreak management tools\nsuch as Epi Info and Microsoft Access. The Illinois Department of Public Health\n(IDPH) has not used REDCap to date. Prior to adopting this web-based application, an\nevaluation was conducted to assess how REDCap may facilitate outbreak data\nmanagement.",

Using these four case studies, we evaluated how\nREDCap may have impacted the response to each outbreak using six criteria: 1)\nmagnitude of cases and contacts across jurisdictions; 2) self-reporting of symptoms\nand exposures; 3) storage and multi- site access to lab reports; 4) reuse of\ntemplates for future outbreaks; 5) repeated measurements; and 6) ability to perform\nlong-term case follow-up.",

For all four types of outbreaks, REDCap would have facilitated\nself-reporting of symptoms and exposures through the design and administration of\nonline surveys to cases and contacts. REDCap\u2019s document upload functionality\nwould have facilitated storage and access of lab reports for foodborne illness, MERS\nCoV, and NDM outbreaks. REDCap also would allow public health responders to perform\nlong-term monitoring of symptoms and disease incidence in NDM outbreaks.",
