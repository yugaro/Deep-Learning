            "text": "The primary biological action of the secosteroid hormone vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is to bind to the vitamin D receptor (NR1I1/VDR) and to regulate serum calcium levels. As a downstream consequence, the actions of the receptor control bone formation and maintenance. The first clinical manifestation of insufficient VDR endocrine signaling, rickets, was discovered by Daniel Whistler in the Netherlands in the 17th century; 300 years later, the VDR gene was cloned by Bert O\u2019Malley and coworkers.1 Between these dates, research into vitamin D was at the forefront of areas of public health, chemistry and biochemistry including the light catalyzed synthesis of vitamin D3 by Adolf Windaus. For this work, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1928). Work in the 1960s and 1970s led to analyses of vitamin D endocrine metabolism and led to remarkable strides describing biochemical synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the diverse biology in which VDR participates.",

A further hydroxylation occurs in the principally in the kidney at the carbon 1 position by 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP27B1) to produce the biologically active hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3. A second mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme, the 24-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP24A1), can use both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D3 as substrates, and is the first step in the inactivation pathway for these metabolites. Because of the direct role 1,25(OH)2D3 plays in control of serum calcium levels, elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 block its synthesis and induce inactivation and accelerate catabolism2 via induction of CYP24A1, in a classical negative feedback loop.",

That is, skin pigmentation was lost as humans migrated out of Africa to adjust to life with reduced solar UV exposure. As a result, individual capacity to generate vitamin D3 in response to solar UV exposure is intimately associated with forebear environmental adaptation. The correct and sufficient level of solar exposure and serum vitamin D3 are matters of considerable debate, and an Institute of Medicine report3 in 2010 recommended daily vitamin D3 intake at the levels of 600 IU/d for most groups in the population (800 IU/d for those >70 years of age). However, this recommendation is not without controversy; parallel reassessment of the vitamin D impact on the prevention of osteoporosis has suggested that the correct level may be as high as 2 to 3000 IU/d, which may reflect more accurately ancestral serum levels.4 Another challenge is determining how a given intake relates to serum levels among individuals5,6 and what are the appropriate biochemical readouts for measuring systemic response.",

These chimeric proteins disrupt the control of differentiation and give rise to APL.18\u201320 Pharmacologic doses of all-trans retinoic acid are able to trigger differentiation and, therefore, this therapy in APL is a dramatic example of targeted cancer therapies; in addition, these findings contributed significantly to the rise of the concept of differentiation therapy.21\u201329 All-trans retinoic acid remains the mainstay of therapy for APL30,31 and this is a major catalyst for studying RARs across cancers.29,32,33 As a result, workers began to consider exploiting the antiproliferative actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 as a differentiation therapy in cancers.

For example, early studies focused on understanding antiproliferative pathways, be they mediating cell cycle arrest37,45\u201347 or programmed cell death.48\u201350 However, other studies supported a role for 1,25(OH)2D3 to block or impede programmed cell death.51,52 Historically, hematologic malignancies combined an ease of interrogation with robust classification of cellular differentiation capacity that were envied by investigators of solid tumors. It is, therefore, no coincidence that these cell systems led to the identification of VDR control of genes that control cell cycle progression, including p21(waf1/cip1) and p27(kip1), as well as the direct binding sites on the gene CDKN1A (encodes p21(waf1/cip1)).53,54 The regulation of p27(kip1) seems to be mechanistically enigmatic and exemplifies the broad effects of VDR signaling in that both transcriptional and translational regulation, such as enhanced mRNA translation, and attenuating degradative mechanisms are described?55\u201358",

In this manner, a significant role of cross-talk between VDR and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling has been revealed.112,113 In addition, similar studies have shown that VDR transcriptional targets can distinguish leukemia aggressiveness.114 The list of gene targets that is common across cell models seems to be short; the most clearly shared target is CYP24A1. Beyond that, commonly enriched gene networks often focus on cell cycle control and signal transduction. However, substantial variations in experimental design (eg, dose, exposure time, and use of 1,25(OH)2D3 or an analog) limit strict comparisons. Thus, although a formal metaanalysis to reveal common themes has not been applied,115,116 it seems clear that there is little overlap between the transcriptomic studies. It is also noteworthy that datasets have been developed that are aimed at noncoding RNA species.117,118 Therefore, the diversity of the VDR regulated transcriptome is likely to increase.",

            "text": "More recently, these transcriptomic studies have been complemented by VDR ChIP-Seq studies in which the VDR genomic binding patterns have been captured. VDR ChIP-seq studies have been performed in several human cell types,119\u2013123 in the presence and/or absence of ligand, and revealed the impact of ligand binding on VDR genomic targeting. Arguably, VDR ChIP-seq studies are more important than transcriptomic studies because they reveal direct VDR genomic interactions, whereas transcriptomic analyses inevitably include direct and indirect VDR-mediated effects. Each VDR ChIP-Seq analysis revealed approximately 2000 to 6000 genomic loci normally distributed around transcription start sites, reflecting the binomial distributions found for other transcription factors,123,124 but many loci are found at considerable distance from the transcription start sites. Another important finding from these studies is that the dual hexameric DNA motif spaced by 3 bp, a so-called DR3 motif,125,126 is found in the majority but not all of the most prominent genomic VDR binding sites. Other binding motifs have also been suggested, for example, an inverted palindrome spaced by 9 bp, a so-called IP-9.127,128 The application of ChIP-Seq approaches to NRs in general has revealed greater binding site diversity than previously expected; in addition the importance of flanking regions for cofactors to be biologically important to determine function.129 These aspects of transcriptional regulation are described in greater depth in J.

A number of investigators have considered the option of treating men with localized disease before surgery and then studying the prostate tumor after surgery for characterization of known VDR target genes. In a trial of nearly 40 patients with localized prostate cancer, Beer and colleagues218 administered either 1,25(OH)2D3 or placebo for 4 weeks before radical prostatectomy. Expression changes in the VDR or known candidate VDR target genes of markers of cell proliferation were examined. Interestingly VDR was downregulated in the treatment group, whereas the other genes chosen (eg, TGFBR2) were unchanged. Others replicated this approach but with doxercalciferol and revealed significant modulation of TGFBR2. Interestingly, microarray studies of 1,25(OH)2D3 sensitivity in isogenic breast cancer cell lines established that TGFBR2 was a critical mediator and marker of sensitivity toward 1,25(OH)2D3.112 Other investigators have examined the question of efficacy by escalating dose to assess how well higher levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 can be tolerated.219 Together these studies suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 can be given to prostate cancer patients at quite high doses and changes in expression of VDR-dependent genes can be observed.",

Such combination studies are intrinsically challenging; in the vitamin D arena, Novocea undertook such an approach in their development of DN-101 (a new formulation of 1,25(OH)2D3) as a cancer therapy in combination with docetaxel for men with advanced prostate cancer that had failed hormonal therapy, so-called castration resistant prostate cancer. Based on numerous preclinical studies and a single institution clinical study, Novocea conducted a randomized phase III study (ASCENT I [AIPC Study of Calcitriol ENhancing Taxotere]) to determine whether the prostate-specific antigen response rate (defined as a >50% decline in prostate-specific antigen for >1 month) was different for the standard therapy for castration resistant prostate cancer at the time (docetaxel 36 mg/m2 weekly intravenously for 4 weeks every 6 weeks) compared with the same dose and schedule of docetaxel plus DN-101, 45 mg weekly.220 Although this study did not meet the prostate-specific antigen response criteria, it did alter the overall survival and therefore justified a large randomized trial to assess survival. This new trial (ASCENT II) was halted before full recruitment because survival in the DN-101 arm was reduced compared with standard of care. However, the ASCENT II trial design was seriously flawed: the chemotherapy in each arm was not equal in efficacy. The design of the trial was docetaxel A + DN-101 versus docetaxel B + placebo. Substantial data existed at the time that the trial was initiated that docetaxel A was clearly inferior to docetaxel B in terms of survival in men with castration resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, the trial was actually designed to ask the question, can DN-101 overcome the inferiority of docetaxel regimen A.",

The interactions of transcriptional corepressors such as NCOR1 and NCOR2/SMRT have been examined to investigate this possibility.61,256\u2013261 In turn, altered VDR\u2013corepressor interactions may form a molecular lesion that could be targeted by cotreatment of 1,25(OH)2D3 plus the HDAC inhibitors.262\u2013267",

This partly reflects that the biology is now very well-understood, that the toxicities associated with vitamin D compounds are easily monitored and managed and that in an era of high dimensional biological data it is possible to measure and dissect the actions of VDR signaling in very great detail. It seems likely that efforts will continue to exploit vitamin D compounds in the clinical setting, and it may well be that by exploiting tools to very accurately measure tumor type and burden will allow vitamin D-centered therapies to be applied with great precision. It seems likely that among the actions of VDR, the immunomodulatory capacity may ultimately be the ones that are most advantageous in cancer therapies.",
