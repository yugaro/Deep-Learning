Although most samples reacted to both recombinant proteins, the plasma of ferret\nNo.10 and serum of ferret No.22 only reacted to GST-N (1-179) and did not recognize GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2). These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) was suitable for detection of antibodies to FRCoVs.\nTherefore, we decided to use GST-N (1-179) in the subsequent investigation.
