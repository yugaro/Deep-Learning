In LRI, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the major cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality in children, which can be defined as symptoms of pneumonia caused by community acquired infection without predisposing factors in previous healthy children. CAP is one of the most common diseases in children, and also second leading cause of death for children in developing countries. In addition, CAP is one of the most common causes of hospitalization among developed countries. The incidence of CAP is 10 to 40/10,000 for children under 5 years of age and 11 to 16/10,000 for children between the age of 5 and 14 years.[1,2]",

Thus, as a negative acute phase protein, PA can be used to identify bacterial or viral infections in children with acute infectious disease. However, the role of PA in children with CAP is still unclear, especially its roles in severity assessment of CAP. Therefore, our study aims to investigate the role of PA in the diagnosis and severity assessment of children with CAP in order to guide clinical decision-making.",

CAP was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (fever and respiratory symptoms) and pulmonary condensation on chest radiography in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that was acquired outside the hospital.[6] Children who had received antibiotic treatments for more than 48 hours before admission or had been suffering from an underlying chronic respiratory disease were excluded from the study. A total of 33 healthy children were selected as the control group, aged from 8 months to 9.8 years (average age was 4.7 years). A total of 174 cases of CAP patients were further divided into 4 groups according to the admission time. A total of 47 cases were in spring (March\u2013May), 64 cases were in summer (June\u2013August), 32 cases were in autumn (September\u2013November), and 31 cases were in winter (December\u2013February). According to the scope of X-ray pulmonary infiltration, presence of hypoxemia, and presence of pulmonary or extrapulmonary complications,[7] CAP group was further divided into mild group (133 cases) and severe group (22 cases), 19 cases without performing chest X-ray were not included in the study.

Infants and young children under age 3 years often manifest as mild or subclinical infection. The peak age with MP infection is preschool and school-age children, 7% to 30% of patients with CAP between ages 3 and 15 years are caused by MP infection.[12] Shu et al[11] found that children between ages 6 and 14 years have a high detection rate of MP infection (77.4%), and the lowest detection rate was from children under age 1 year (11.2%). In our study, the detection rate of MP was 27.4%, which was lower than 43.64% that reported by Shu, the reason might be attributed to the low average age of children in this study. MP infections can occur throughout the year, and the peak season was different in different regions. The epidemic seasons in north of China is winter but is summer and autumn in the south of China.[12] There was no seasonal difference for positive rate of MP infections in this study, which might be related to the small sample size. In addition, we found there was no significant correlation between the severity of CAP in children and the presence of MP infection; it was possible that bacterial pathogens were the major cause of severe CAP.[13]",

The valuable laboratory tools are also needed in the management of CAP in children, which can offer the useful clinical information on determination of appropriate treatment and courses with antibiotics based on the detected etiology agent, as well as the prognosis of the disease. PCT, a protein containing 116 amino acids, is normally produced by neuroendocrine cells in the thyroid and lungs at a very low rate and is undetectable in serum.[14] Inflammatory and infectious injuries stimulate overexpression of the CALC1 gene consequently increasing serum PCT. Under these pathologic conditions, synthesis and secretion of PCT become ubiquitous.[15] CRP is an acute phase reaction protein synthesized in the liver and is considered as a good index for early diagnosis of inflammation.[16] The usefulness of PCT and CRP in the management of pediatric CAP has been carefully studied and compared. Overall, the latest data showed that PCT was the best diagnostic marker compared to CRP, especially for the detection of pneumococcal infection.[17,18] However, there was no significant increase of PCT and CRP in our study, which might be attributed to a low rate of bacterial infection. Actually in CAP children infected with virus and mycoplasma, PCT and CRP are not elevated or only mildly elevated.[19,20]",

Shao et al[24] found that the PA levels were decreased in CAP group that infected with different pathogens, whereas PA reduction was more significant in bacterial infection group. Similar results were found in this study, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of CAP with traditional cutoff value was 0.847, which was significant higher than traditional inflammatory indicators. Moreover, it was found that PA was an independent protective factor for CAP in children based on multivariate analysis. It was proposed that the combination of PA with the traditional inflammatory indicators may make up the deficiency of their low sensitivity and improve the diagnostic efficacy of CAP.",
