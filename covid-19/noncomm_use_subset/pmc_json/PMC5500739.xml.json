The rapid and accurate diagnosis of the underlying pathogen is crucial for establishing good clinical practices aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality [456]. Diagnosing RV infections involves detection of the causative viruses in specimens obtained from patients, such as sputum and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. Traditionally, virus cultures and/or direct fluorescent-antibody assays have been used to detect the viruses [789]. Recently, multiplex PCR-based methods have been developed and introduced for clinical use, given their advantages of decreased hands-on time and improved sensitivity [89].",

The Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) and RVP FAST v1 assays (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) proved to be clinically useful in previous studies [12131415], and a revised version (xTAG RVP Fast v2) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics) was recently released in 2013. The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay is a multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay that is incorporated with the Luminex tagging system. Following the first release of the Luminex xTAG RVP assay, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics issued a revised version. The new assay have several advantages over the other assays: 1) detect more types of viruses (19 strains); 2) distinguish among influenza A subtypes (H1, H3, 2009 H1N1), coronavirus HKU1, and parainfluenza type 4; 3) handle the largest number of specimens in one run (94 specimens); 4) use a small specimen volume (10 \u00b5L of nucleic acids); and 5) produce semi-quantitative results as the fluorescence intensity.",

Among the specimens with three complete sets of assay results, there were slightly more discrepancies for cases of multiple infections than for single-infection cases (26 vs 17).
