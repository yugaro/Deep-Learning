To inhibit anti-apoptosis (ie, promote apoptosis) and interfere with tumor cell survival, several small-molecule drugs that mimic pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins were developed.3 The BH3-mimetics include ABT-7374 and its orally available derivative ABT-263.5 These BH3-mimetics bind selectively to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w and interfere with cell survival; however, they do not bind to Mcl-1 and some cancers cannot be treated by these compounds alone. To complicate things further, upregulation of Mcl-1 is a key factor in the development of resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-263.2 Thus, there is an unmet need to design ligands, and in particular new small molecules, that inhibit Mcl-1.6",

Our MD simulation comprises three stages, namely, system heating using constant number, constant volume, and constant temperature (NVT), system equilibration using constant number, constant pressure, and constant temperature (NPT), and production using NVT. System heating uses NVT (ie, constant volume) since at low temperatures, pressure calculation may lead to barostat overcorrection and system instabilities. System equilibration uses NPT (ie, constant pressure) and allows system density to equilibrate before production. Production uses NVT (ie, constant volume). Our MD simulation is based on a protocol similar to the one described by Romero-Durana et al.31 Shortly, each time step was set to 2 fs, heating time was 200 ps, equilibration time was 1 ns, and production time was 200 ns (see Supplementary materials, Figure S1).",

Similarity is determined by a distance metric \u2013 the smaller the distance, the more similar the structures. One commonly used distance metric is coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD).

As such, nilotinib is a promising candidate for Mcl-1-targeted cancer therapies. Cabergoline is an ergot derivative and a potent D2 dopamine receptor agonist used in the treatment of prolactinomas and uterine fibroids.43 Cabergoline contains a tricyclic ring that is structurally related to the pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, S1,37,38 a Bcl-2 family inhibitor that binds to Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with nanomolar affinity, disrupts Bax/Bcl-2 and Bak/Mcl-1 complexes, induces Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis,37 increases oxidative stress,44 and disrupts the interaction of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2.45 Cabergoline is currently undergoing clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer as an adjuvant therapy of tamoxifen (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01730729). Miltefosine is an alkylphosphocholine first studied as a treatment for cancer and approved for leishmaniasis in India. Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid that inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation.

They are composed of a tricyclic head and an indole-like tail. Two other drugs do not seem to be associated with cancer and dopamine/serotonin pharmacology.

Azelastine is a second-generation H1 histamine receptor antagonist, deferasirox is an oral iron chelator used to reduce chronic iron overload, and torsemide is a pyridine-sulfonylurea-type loop diuretic mainly used in the management of edema associated with congestive heart failure.

AutoDock Vina was applied once for each Mcl-1 protein conformation, but by sampling multiple conformations, the signal-to-noise ratio of true positives is expected to increase. Ligands with low standard deviation of binding energies usually have few rotatable bonds, are rigid, and sometimes symmetric. For example, dihydroartemisinin and artemeter are rigidified by the polycyclic skeleton, whereas carbofenotion contains a C2 axis of pseudosymmetry. Contrarily, ligands with high standard deviations are highly flexible. The standard deviation is an indicator of entropy, and the more conformations a ligand may adopt, the more receptor poses are possible. Often, drug candidates with low standard deviation are preferred as binding is confined, but not always.",
