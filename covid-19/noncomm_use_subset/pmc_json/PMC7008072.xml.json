This suggests that the possibility of 2019-nCoV pneumonia cannot be excluded based only on the clinical clues. And the patient is still in a severe clinical course with high oxygen demand for more than two weeks.2 Based on this clinical course, although the 2019-nCoV is tentatively known to have less severity of the disease than SARS, the virulence of the disease needs to be evaluated more carefully.",

As Yoo3 mentioned in the last issue of the Journal of Korean Medical Science, clearing the present outbreak of 2019-CoV in Korea may last longer period than expected.
