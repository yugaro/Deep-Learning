A literature survey revealed that azo molecules are popular for versatile uses such as antiseptics,2 antimicrobial,3 antidiabetics,4 antineoplastics,5 transmissible spongiform encephalopathy,6 antiulcerative,7 antoxidant,8 analgesic,9 antiinflammatory,10 antiviral,11 antitubercular10 and antitumour12 activities.",

To conduct the sighting study, a single animal was provided with suspensions of the synthesized compounds having a specific dose, viz. 5 mg, 50 mg, 300 mg and 2000 mg/kg body weight, with the aid of an intubation canula. A period of 24 h was maintained between each dosing. In the main study, another 4 animals were administered 2000 mg/kg. The animals were observed for a period of 14 days.

The only exception is the bands due to OH str. at 3479\u20133445 cm\u22121 exhibited in the ligands that are not observable in the complexes. In metal Cu(II), Ni(II) Co(II) and Zn(II) complexes of 3a and 3b, the FT/IR absorption band due to the hydroxyl group at 4-HC has been diminished and indicates the metal co-ordination of the OH group via deprotonation due to liberation of hydrochloric acid. In addition to these FT/IR spectral data, stretching of the M\u2212N and M\u2212O bonds of the complexes, which appear in the higher frequency wavenumber region in the range 451\u2013441 and 538\u2013531 cm\u22121, also indicates that complexation occurred through nitrogen and oxygen atoms from the azo-enolic ligands.22, 23 The 1H NMR spectra of ligands 3a and 3b showed the enolic OH peak at 16.81 and 16.86 ppm. The disappearance of the enolic OH group in all the complexes (4a\u20134h) may be due to the interaction of metal chlorides with the hydroxyl group of the ligands resulting in deprotonation and complexation of the ligands to the metal ions. Ligand 3b shows three identical, similar-environment protons at 3.83 ppm, which indicates the presence of an \u2013OCH3 functional group. The good bathochromic shift at 463 and 450 nm exhibited by complexes 4a and 4e may be due to the attachment of transition metal ion Co++ to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. Most of the compounds showed good antimicrobial activity in comparison to ampicillin. The enhanced antimicrobial activity exhibited by complexes 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f relative to their ligands against E. coli may be due to coordination of Co++ and Ni++ ions to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. However, complexes 4a and 4e showed considerably enhanced antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic strains relative to their ligands. Complexation reduces the polarity of the metal ion by coordinating with ligands and increases the lipophilicity of the metals.24 Thus, it facilitates the penetration of the novel synthesized complexes into the lipoid cell membrane of microorganisms and inhibits their growth.",
