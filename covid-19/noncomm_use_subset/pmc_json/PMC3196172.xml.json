To avoid these, ensure that the points of the curved micro scissors are always facing away from the cord and carefully examine the laminectomized spine to ensure that all bone fragments are cleared and that the remaining vertebral structure does not have overtly protruding or jagged edges.

Furthermore, the timing for each procedure should be optimized to minimize the time the cells are waiting on ice. For example, we transplant our mice in groups of four (the number of doses in each load of the syringe), the person injecting the cells starts loading the syringe after the third mouse has been laminectomized and the person preparing the mice should anesthetize the following group after the second mouse of the previous group has been laminectomized.
