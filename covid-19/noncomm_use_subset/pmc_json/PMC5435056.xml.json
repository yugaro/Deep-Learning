The analyses evaluating the similarity of community membership and structure of the fecal microbiota showed that calves from the same farm shared similar microbial communities regardless of the health status when compared to healthy and diarrheic calves from a different farm. The degree of interfarm variation is important to recognize, particularly because earlier studies have been based primarily on animals from single facilities. These data indicate potentially important differences between facilities that must be considered when designing and interpreting microbiota studies.",

The increase in diarrheic calves is not surprising as this phylum often is associated with intestinal dysbiosis,46 but the difference between farms was interesting. A recent study of nursing calves from 5 beef farms identified some farms with high relative abundances of Proteobacteria,47 suggesting that higher Proteobacteria levels could be a farm\u2010associated effect, perhaps from management practices. This could be of concern because recent studies have identified a mechanistic interrelation among Proteobacteria, the gut immune response, and inflammation.48, 49 Dysregulated innate immune responses can elicit the bloom of Proteobacteria that promotes gut inflammation and facilitate inflammation or invasion by pathogens.50, 51 Additionally, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. was lower in healthy calves, a somewhat surprising result because F. prausnitzii has been associated with anti\u2010inflammatory properties by stimulating the production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines, decreasing the secretion of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and by the production of butyrate.52, 53 Contradictory results regarding the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium spp in feces of preweaned calves from different farms also have been reported in dairy12, 27 and beef calves.47 The reasons accounting for these differences are unclear, but differences in methodologies among studies as well as a farm\u2010associated effects (management practices) could explain the differences in gut microbiota.",

            "text": "The PICRUSt analysis was used to infer functional capabilities of the microbial communities. This approach infers the functional capacity of the microbiota by prediction of functional genes that typically are associated with different taxa. Although the biological relevance of this approach is still unclear, LEfSe analysis identified several functional gene categories that were enriched in healthy and diarrheic calves. Diarrheic calves had decreased abundances of genes responsible for metabolism of various vitamins (eg, folate, panthotenate), amino acids (eg, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, threonine) and carbohydrate metabolism. This imbalance might indicate that free vitamin and nutrient availability is altered in diarrheic calves. Alterations in amino acid metabolism have been observed in dogs with chronic diarrhea caused by idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease,53 in cats with acute diarrhea,54 and in humans with gut inflammation,67 suggesting that amino acid dysmetabolism may be an important feature of dysbiosis\u2010associated diseases. Increased relative abundances of genes associated with porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism also were present in diarrheic calves. Porphyrins are tetrapyrroles that bind covalently to a metal (iron, to form cytochromes, peroxidase, catalase, myoglobin, and hemoglobin; copper or nickel, to form molecules for electron transport in methanogenic bacteria).68 In non\u2010photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, insects, fungi, and protozoa, as well as in the \u03b1\u2010Proteobacteria group of bacteria, the committed step for porphyrin biosynthesis is the formation of \u03b4\u2010aminolevulinic acid by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl CoA from the citric acid cycle.68 Metabolites such as \u03b4\u2010aminolevulinic acid potentially could be used as a marker of increased abundance of Proteobacteria and therefore dysbiosis. However, PICRUSt is only a predictor of metagenomic function, and metabolomic approaches are preferred to identify factual changes in metabolic function of microbiota of diarrheic calves and identify markers of unstable gut microbiota.",
