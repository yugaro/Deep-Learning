In particular, IFN-\u03b1 is produced during CHIKV infection and has been shown to strongly inhibit CHIKV in vitro [14]. Therefore, the overproduction of type-I IFN is rather surprising in the lethal CHIKV infection here described. Elevated type-I IFN levels are known to be associated with clinical severity and poor therapy response in chronic diseases of viral (ie, hepatitis C virus and HIV) and autoimmune (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus) etiology [15, 16], whereas overproduction in acute viral infections is rarely reported in humans. One report showed that in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection, the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 and other cytokines, including IL-6, is correlated with the severity of the disease, suggesting that high levels of IFN-\u03b1 could not control SFTSV in humans but may be involved in the cytokine storm and in the virus pathogenesis [17]. Furthermore, a few studies have shown that abnormally elevated type-I IFN levels can cause morbidity and mortality, as opposed to protection, during influenza virus infection in animal models [18].",

Our findings are consistent with a possible role of type-I IFN in the CHIKV-driven cytokine storm that, in turn, may have contributed to enhanced tissue injury and unfavorable prognosis in a patient with predisposing factors. However, due to the extremely small number of CHIKV-infected patients and to the lack of comparison with uninfected patients with cardiac disease, from the present study it is not possible to establish whether CHIKV or the underlying cardiac dysfunction was the actual cause of the altered cytokine profile; it is also likely that infection, underlying morbidity, and elderly condition all contributed.",

The tree also includes CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 (MG049915), that is, the prototype sequence representing the same outbreak [6], in the context of whole-genome sequences representing the 3 major CHIKV lineages: ECSA (including the Indian Ocean lineage [IOL]), Asia-Caribbean, and West Africa, indicated with their accession numbers, geographic origins, and years of sampling. Sixteen sequences of the Asia-Caribbean (n = 12) and West Africa (n = 4) lineages are collapsed to increase the clarity of the figure.
