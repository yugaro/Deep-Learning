This novel group II coronavirus infected over 8,000 people worldwide, with a mortality rate of ~10% (3). In 2012, a novel human betacoronavirus from group 2c named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Middle East. This virus causes severe pneumonia and renal failure with an approximately 55% mortality in over 77 confirmed cases to date (4). SARS-CoV primarily infected type II pneumocytes, which are normally responsible for production of lung surfactants and function as the progenitor cells of type I pneumocytes (5). Disease severity was heavily influenced by age and other comorbidities, as mortality rates were >50% in populations over 65 years of age.",

Progression to acute lung injury (ALI) and the more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often involved an acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is characterized by exudates and hyaline membranes in the lung alveoli (5). Biopsy and autopsy findings from SARS patients within the early stages of infection revealed the presence of exudative-phase DAD along with increased numbers of macrophages in the lung (1, 6). Many patients also had lung hemorrhage, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and/or hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar spaces. Patients with longer-term disease (>10 days postinfection [dpi]) manifested with proliferative- or organizing-phase DAD that encompassed 25% to 100% of the lung (8). They also had signs of lung fibrosis in both alveolar and interstitial spaces. SARS survivors continue to show lingering effects of their illness with complications including reduced lung elasticity and function (9).",

Much like SARS-CoV infection, disease progression is first associated with an exudative phase of DAD, which may progress into organizing-phase DAD (13). The presence of exudates in the lung, composed of fibrin and proteinaceous material, blocks normal gas exchange (14). Without clearance of these exudates, lung pathology progresses toward fibrotic disease with collagen deposition and conversion of the exudates into fibrous tissue. Thus, ALI and ARDS represent a common but poorly studied host response to virus-induced severe lung disease.",

Specifically, they capture complex relationships between host gene expression patterns and emergent correlative behaviors (15\u201317). These approaches posit that genes and protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. In this work, we use weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) methods to interpret the dynamic SARS-CoV-mediated transcriptional response. While WGCNA has previously been applied to cancer, mouse, and yeast genetics, we use the approach to enhance systems-based analysis of virus infection (18\u201320). Key to this approach is the ability to discover systemic gene expression patterns based on underlying correlation structures, which is not biased by existing knowledge of pathways or interactions. WGCNA partitions gene expression into groups of transcripts called subnetwork modules with highly correlated behaviors. It has been shown elsewhere that connectivity inferred through WGCNA is a strong predictor of related biological function (21). A key feature of these subnetwork modules, or eigengenes, is that the most highly connected hub genes within the module provide candidate mediators of disease (16, 17). We further refined these candidates by modifying the tool to identify enriched pathways associated with candidate lists, allowing us to combine connectivity and predicted network structure with biological functions and known interactions within a hypothesis-testing framework.",

Disruption of the urokinase pathway is associated with fibrotic lung disease or lung hemorrhage, depending on highly directional signaling cascades. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA or PLAT), negatively regulated by Serpine1, is given as an anticlotting agent to recent stroke patients to promote cleavage of plasminogen into plasmin and enhance breakdown of fibrin clots (25). Although ECM and wound healing pathway activation are known to be important in lung disease, these processes are largely unstudied in relation to in vivo respiratory virus pathogenesis.

Tissue factor, factor VIIa, and Serpine1 are major factors responsible for the development of a procoagulant and antifibrinolytic state in the alveoli (31, 32). Changes in alveolar hemostatic balance and intra-alveolar fibrin deposition are also stimulated by cytokine expression after ALI. Proinflammatory (interleukin-1\u03b2 [IL-1\u03b2], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1], and IL-6) and profibrotic (transforming growth factor \u03b2 [TGF-\u03b2], connective tissue growth factor [CTGF], and platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]) cytokine transcripts were significantly elevated, starting by 4 dpi and through the course of the lethal SARS-CoV MA15 infection (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material). In addition, genes associated with the induction of a procoagulant state (thrombin, factor VIIa, factor Xia, factor XIIa, PLAU, PLAT, tissue factor\nF2r) (32) and other fibrinolysin pathway components were altered by infection. Both pro- and antifibrinolytic genes in the urokinase pathway showed increased expression in our SARS-CoV infection model, demonstrating the complicated nature of this signaling cascade. Previous reports show that it is rare for one branch of the urokinase pathway to have altered regulation without host feedback loops adjusting the expression of other pathway genes (33). In general, the transcripts shown in Fig. S5B represent a lung with high levels of inflammatory and fibrinolytic gene expression, and this transcriptional picture is supported by the hemorrhage observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice.",

Transcriptional data from the lungs of 1918 influenza virus-infected BALB/c mice showed similar patterns of differential expression in the genes responsible for coagulation, surfactant production, and fibrinolysis (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, B6 mice infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus strain CA04 had high levels of proinflammatory, profibrotic, and urokinase pathway gene expression relative to mock-infected mice along with decreased surfactant expression (doses of 103 to 106 PFU [unpublished data]). Overall, these transcription signatures are consistent with reported viral pathological and proteomic findings, strongly supporting the development of altered alveolar hemostatic balance seen during the early exudative phase of DAD.",

Proteomics analysis revealed that fibrin beta and gamma chains, factor VIII, and cytokeratins, all major components of hyaline membranes (34, 35), have increased expression in the lungs following both lethal and sublethal SARS-CoV infection compared to mock infection (Fig. 4A). Similarly, surfactant proteins, which typically protect against hyaline membrane formation and lung injury (36), have reduced expression in both the lethal and sublethal doses of SARS-CoV compared to uninfected controls. However, at late time points, several of these same proteins sharply diverge between the lethal and sublethal doses. Fibrin beta and gamma chain levels are increased in abundance relative to mock infection only at day 7 in the lethal infection. In contrast, fibrin chains continually decrease after 2 dpi in sublethal infection. A similar pattern is observed with keratin 7, with increased protein abundance observed in the lethal dose. To further confirm these findings, we used a Martius scarlet blue (MSB) stain to demonstrate the presence of fibrin deposition in the lungs at day 7. Positive staining was observed in the lungs of lethally infected mice but not in the lungs of mock-infected or sublethally infected animals (Fig. 4B). Together, the proteomics data are consistent with pathophysiological changes resulting in increased fibrin deposition and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs of lethally infected mice.",

Analysis of plasminogen peptides revealed a distinct and significant increase following a lethal dose of SARS-CoV (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the sublethal infection resulted in an initial augmentation but then maintained a low level of plasminogen peptides throughout the course of infection. It is important to note that plasminogen and plasmin are indistinguishable using these proteomics methods. Fibronectin, another component downstream of plasmin activation, also demonstrated increased protein expression in the lethal dose compared to the sublethal dose at day 7. These data are consistent with augmented PLAU/urokinase activity in the lethal dose despite maintaining similarly elevated levels of Serpine1, an inhibitor of the urokinase pathway. Finally, diseases associated with premature or excessive breakdown of fibrin clots are characterized by hemorrhage and the accumulation of fluid exudates in the alveoli. Consistent with the observation of vascular leakage into alveolar spaces and the development of DAD, levels of the serum protein albumin found in the lung were significantly elevated in lethally infected mice (Fig. 4A).",

Additionally, one Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 mouse died, suggesting a necessary and protective role for Serpine1 in modulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Clinical disease in Serpine1\u2212/\u2212 mice mirrored that in lethally infected B6 animals (Fig. 1A), with severely decreased locomotion, hunched posture, and labored breathing at late time points. Despite differences in clinical symptoms, virus load in the lung showed no significant differences between knockout and wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 5B) at 4 or 7 dpi, demonstrating that Serpine1 had no influence on virus replication dynamics.

Mice deficient in PLAT should have a complicated phenotype because of the ability of PLAU to cleave fibrin and compensate in this system.

This approach was applied to our virus infection data sets containing over 3,500 DE genes.

Despite significant advances in treatment options, the overall mortality rates remain substantial and range between 30 and 60%, resulting in ~75,000 deaths in the United States and over a million deaths globally each year (45). While the underlying molecular mechanisms governing virus-induced ALI remain to be elucidated, our transcriptomics, proteomics, modeling, and validation approaches using targeted knockout mice have coalesced into a model of altered hemostatic balance defined by the expression of procoagulative and antifibrinolytic factors resulting in the induction of an exudative phase of DAD after infection. The urokinase pathway regulates fibrinolytic and procoagulative responses designed to prevent vascular permeability and hemorrhage (23, 29).",

            "text": "Fibrin levels dramatically increased following lethal SARS-CoV MA15 infection (Fig. 4A and B). Excess fibrin was likely mediated by Serpine1-driven inhibition of urokinase and tissue type plasminogen activators (PLAU and PLAT) and by blockade of plasmin activity by \u03b12-plasmin inhibitor, whose transcripts are elevated following SARS-CoV infection. We suggest that lethal SARS-CoV infection overwhelms the normally protective, profibrinolytic signaling of the urokinase pathway, leading to overall dysregulation, including increased Serpine1 expression, and severe lung disease. While fibrin is required for normal wound healing, persistent and excessive intra-alveolar fibrin levels can contribute to acute inflammatory and chronic interstitial lung disease. Fibrin stimulates the production of profibrotic growth factors (32), and many profibrotic cytokine transcripts, like TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, and PDGF, are elevated following SARS-CoV or influenza virus infection in mice (see Fig. S5 and S6 in the supplemental material) (46, 47). Pulmonary surfactant protein and transcript signatures are also reduced following acute viral infection (Fig. 4A) (see also Fig. S5) (48), potentially leading to collapse or closure of alveoli and loss of lung compliance (changes in lung volumes) (49). In combination, a high-fibrin/low-surfactant intra-alveolar environment provides an ideal environment for fibroblast adherence and growth, resulting in collagen deposition and development of lung fibrosis (50). Finally, fibrin and fibrin breakdown products increase vascular permeability, stimulate migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells, and promote recruitment of neutrophils to the lung (51, 52). Although we cannot absolutely ascribe this phenotype to elevation in the levels of fibrin and fibrin breakdown products, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis shows significant increases in lung neutrophil counts, as a function of increasing SARS-CoV dose (data not shown). More recent studies have also shown that Serpine1 inhibits neutrophil apoptosis (53), suggesting that neutrophil recruitment and effector function likely contribute to more severe disease outcomes following SARS-CoV MA15 infection. Similar findings have been reported with highly pathogenic influenza viruses, including H5N1 and 1918 influenza viruses (54).",

Notably, increased Serpine1 levels were measured in the blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients during the 2002-2003 epidemic, and increased Serpine1 expression has been measured in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques (55, 56). Necropsy findings from H5N1 influenza patients revealed accumulations of fibrin in the lung along with pulmonary edema and other signs of DAD and hemorrhage (57). Furthermore, 1918 and 2009 H1N1 influenza virus-infected mice showed increased levels of urokinase pathway transcripts (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material; also data not shown). The host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae also includes upregulation of Serpine1 expression to protect against hemorrhage and ALI. The deubiquitinase CYLD provides critical control of Serpine1 expression (58), and in the absence of CYLD, infected mice develop lung fibrosis. Experiments using the mouse model for pneumonic plague have shown that deletion of the bacterial plasminogen activator, which cleaves plasminogen and also Serpine1, changes the course of disease and protects mice from lethal lung injury (59). Combined, these data demonstrate the critical balance of coagulative and fibrinolytic signaling in the lung following injury and suggest a common modality for development of pathogen-induced ALI and ARDS after microbial infection.",

Using this approach, mathematical models and their predictions, as well as the subsequent perturbations and refinement, allowed us to characterize the molecular mechanisms that lead to the initiation and progression of infectious disease pathogenesis.

TO quantifies the degree of shared network neighbors. Modules are represented as eigengenes by taking the first principal component of each set of module transcripts, which describe most of the variance in the module gene expression. We have adapted WGCNA into a workflow with three key steps: (i) de novo network construction, (ii) consensus network analysis, and (iii) network enrichment (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The de novo network construction and the derivation of signaling modules are described in detail in Text S1 in the supplemental material. In addition to analysis of the individual doses, we utilized a consensus approach to identify modules present across both networks (see Fig. S4). Two nodes should be connected in a consensus network only if all of the input networks agree on that connection. We define the consensus network similarity between two nodes as the minimum of the input network similarities. This allows identification of regulatory differences between two networks, even when the resulting topology/modules are conserved.",

A \u2206 average log2 FC was calculated by subtracting the average log2 FC for each dose at day 7. Network enrichment was then performed in two stages: functional enrichment using gene ontology (see Text S1 in the supplemental material for details) and connectivity enrichment. To aid in the prioritization of the candidates to be validated within the modules, we examined the connectivity distribution relative to known canonical pathway membership within each module. We first identified canonical pathways that intersected with a given WGCNA module and then took the average TO connectivity between intersecting members. Ten thousand random samplings of sets of genes of the same size were used to derive a null distribution and determine if a given pathway was enriched for TO connectivity. This provides information regarding possible biological relevance to our putative candidates that had been ranked within the module based on their similarity to the eigengene.",

Samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm to remove debris and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C. At each time point, analysis of individual mouse lungs provided intensity values for proteins derived from multiple peptides. The mean intensity (abundance) for each protein was then graphed as an average (n = 5 for infection, n = 3 for mock infection) for each group at each time point. Missing or absent values were not scored; however, if no value was observed in any of the samples at a time point, the sample was registered with a single 0, representing \u201cnot detected.\u201d Full details of the proteomics sample preparation methods are in the supplemental material.",
