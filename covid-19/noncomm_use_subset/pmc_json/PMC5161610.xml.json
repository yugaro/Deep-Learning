As of 8 July 2016, YF cases have been exported from Angola to Kenya (2 cases), China (11), and DRC (59), raising concern that YF could resurge in other populations where competent vectors are present and vaccine coverage is low.1,2 Indeed, DRC has already declared a YF epidemic in Kinshasa and two other provinces. A broad band of sub-Saharan Africa north of Namibia and Zambia is at risk (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/africa.html), as is much of the northern portion of South America (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/south_america.html). The global community is increasingly concerned for the risk of YF emergence in Asia, where the disease has been curiously absent despite seemingly amenable conditions.",

With a throughput of only 2 to 4 million doses per month, YF vaccine supply is inadequate given the large urban populations at risk for YF infection. In response to such shortage, dose fractionation has been proposed to maximize the public health benefit of the available YF vaccines.4 Under dose fractionation, a smaller amount of antigen would be used per dose in order to increase the number of persons who can be vaccinated with a given quantity of vaccine.3 This strategy was previously proposed to extend pre-pandemic influenza vaccine supplies.5 If dose fractionation were consistently adopted, equity of YF vaccine access would also be enhanced both within and across countries at risk, as more people could benefit from vaccination without depriving others.6",

The first is a randomized, noninferiority trial which showed that 0\u00b71 ml intradermal (ID) vaccination with the 17D YF vaccine was equally safe and immunogenic compared to the standard 0\u00b75ml subcutaneous vaccination.8 The second is a randomized trial of subcutaneous administration of the 17DD vaccine given in Brazil which showed that there was no significant difference in immunogenicity and viremia kinetics when the currently administered vaccine (containing 27,476 IU of virus) was given at subdoses as low as 11% of the full dose (3,013 IU).9 Even lower doses produced noninferior immune responses, but not equivalent viremia kinetics.9 For comparison, the WHO minimum for YF vaccines is 1,000 IU per dose at the end of shelf life.10 No efficacy trial of YF vaccines, however, has ever been performed in humans,11 so the comparative efficacy of different doses and routes of administration remains uncertain. In particular, it is not known whether equal immunogenicity implies equal vaccine efficacy for YF vaccines. Moreover, the findings of equal immunogenicity of reduced doses are limited to healthy adults; no comparable data exist in children (thus the age cutoff of 2 years for fractional-dose vaccines in Kinshasa), elderly or immunocompromised individuals (e.g. HIV-infected people, pregnant women, etc.). As such, while noninferior immunogenicity of fractional-dose vaccines provide a strong basis for an initial consideration of dose-sparing strategies for YF vaccines, it would be prudent to ensure the robustness of this strategy by carefully evaluating the risk and epidemiologic impact of reduced vaccine efficacy in fractional-dose vaccines. Such an evaluation is nontrivial because even if dose fractionation reduces vaccine efficacy, higher vaccine coverage may confer higher herd immunity in which case the number of infections could be significantly reduced by the indirect effect of large-scale vaccination.12 The lower the transmissibility, the larger the number of infections that can be averted by indirect protection, as illustrated by the previous study of dose fractionation for pre-pandemic influenza vaccines.5 The importance of herd immunity for YF vaccination is unknown because transmissibility of YF in urban settings has never been adequately characterized due to limited data.",

We find that all dose-sparing strategies considered are likely to provide significant benefit epidemiologically, and that the best policy will be determined by balancing logistical and regulatory considerations against the extent of epidemiologic benefit. In particular, we conclude that the WHO Kinshasa dose-sparing vaccination campaign in July\u2013August 2006 would be an effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate, and the results would be robust against a large margin for error in case five-fold fractional-dose efficacy turns out to be lower than expected.",

To this end, we use the Wallinga and Teunis method13 to estimate the reproductive number of YF from the daily number of confirmed YF cases recorded in the 17 April 2016 WHO Angola Situation Report,14 assuming that all cases were attributed to local transmission (i.e. no importation of cases). When estimating the extrinsic incubation period, we assume that the average temperature in Angola was 28 degrees Celsius during the outbreak. To estimate the serial interval distribution, we make the following assumptions: (i) the extrinsic incubation period follows the Weibull distribution estimated by ref.15 which has mean 12\u00b77 days at 28 degrees Celsius; (ii) the intrinsic incubation period follows the lognormal distribution estimated by ref.15 which has mean 4\u00b76 days; (iii) the infectious period in human is exponentially distributed with mean 4 days;16 (iv) the mosquito lifespan is exponentially distributed with mean 7 to 14 days.17 We estimate the initial reproductive number of the YF outbreak in Angola as the average reproductive number among all cases who developed symptoms one serial interval before vaccination campaign began to affect disease transmission (see Figure 1).",

That is, the vaccine efficacy of standard-dose vaccines is VE(1) which was assumed to be 1. Given V, the highest fractionation sensible is nmax = S0/V if the susceptible population can be identified for targeted vaccination and nmax = 1/V otherwise, i.e. the fractionation n must lie between 1 and nmax. To avoid overstating the benefit of dose fractionation, we assume that vaccine efficacy of n-fold fractional-dose vaccines for n between 1 and 5 increases linearly with the amount of antigen in the vaccines (see appendix for explanation). Potential increases in vaccine wastage during dose-sparing would be mostly due to unused, reconstituted vaccines18 or increased vaccine failure due to inexperience with intradermal administration among vaccinators.

We term this the benefit threshold for dose fractionation. We also consider the alternative case in which vaccine action is leaky, i.e. n-fold fractional-dose vaccines reduce the hazard of infection (the probability of disease transmission per mosquito bite) of each vaccinee by a proportion VE(n).22,23 Compared to all-or-nothing vaccines, leaky vaccines have substantially higher benefit thresholds, especially when transmissibility is high (see Results). However, YF vaccine action is much more likely to be all-or-nothing than leaky (see Discussion). As such, we present our main results in the context of all-or-nothing vaccine action. In principle, disease transmission can be halted if the effective vaccine coverage, defined as the proportion of population immunized (e.g.V \u00d7 n \u00d7 VE(n) if vaccination comprises n-fold fractional-dose vaccines only), exceeds the herd immunity threshold 1 \u2212 1/R0.",

To illustrate the potential impact of dose fractionation, we first consider a hypothetical scenario where the entire population is susceptible (S0 = 1) and each individual has the same probability of receiving vaccination. We compare the outcome of using the entire vaccine stockpile for either standard-dose or five-fold fractional-dose vaccination. If some individuals are immune (S0 < 1, due to previous exposure or vaccination) and vaccination can be targeted at susceptible individuals only, then the resulting IAR within the susceptible population would be the same as that for random vaccination in a completely susceptible population with coverage V / S0 and basic reproductive number R0S0.The Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July\u2013August 2016. The population size of Kinshasa is estimated to be around 12.46 million (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/population/CG_popgraph%202015.bmp) and around 2\u00b75 million standard-dose vaccines is expected to be administered to the Kinshasa population during this vaccination campaign (personal communication, Bruce Aylward and Alejandro Costa, WHO). Under the WHO dose-sparing strategy, 200,000 standard-dose vaccines will be given to children aged between 9 months and 2 years (which is sufficient for vaccinating all unvaccinated children in this age range) and the remaining allocation will be fractionated to one-fifth of the standard dose and given to the rest of the population. We compare the outcome when the vaccines are administered (i) in standard dose only (strategy S) and (ii) according to the WHO dose-sparing strategy with alternative age cutoffs for fractional-dose vaccines ranging from 2 to 20 years (strategy F). For the latter, let Z be the age cutoff and p(Z) be the proportion of population targeted for standard-dose vaccination. For a given standard-dose vaccine coverage V, the proportion of population receiving standard-dose and fractional-dose vaccines are min(V, p(Z)) and 5 max(V \u2212 p(Z), 0), respectively. Therefore, the effective vaccine coverage after the vaccination campaign is B + min(V, p(Z)) \u00b7 VE(1) + 5 max(V \u2212 p(Z), 0) \u00b7 VE(5) where B is the vaccine coverage immediately before the campaign (i.e. at the end of June 2016).

We consider this assumption of full efficacy for five-fold fractionation to be the most likely scenario, despite the lack of efficacy data on any YF vaccine, for several reasons: 1) two studies of five- or greater-fold vaccination doses have shown indistinguishable immunogenicity in humans; 2) at least some preparations of YF vaccine substantially exceed the WHO minimum standard for potency of 1,000 IU/dose, so fractionation at some level could be performed without dropping below that threshold; 3) YF vaccine is live attenuated virus, so a biological rationale exists that if a productive vaccine-virus infection can be established by a fractionated dose, protection should be comparable to that with a higher dose. Nonetheless, to assess the robustness of the conclusion that dose fractionation is likely to be beneficial, against the possibility that in fact efficacy of fractionated doses is lower than anticipated, we consider the possibility that five-fold fractionated dosing fails to immunize a proportion (1\u2212VE(5)) of recipients. We find that as long as at least 20% of recipients are fully immunized by the vaccine, more people would be immunized by vaccinating five times as many people with one-fifth the dose, and so the population-wide benefits of higher coverage would outweigh the lower efficacy of fractionated dosing for individual vaccinees.",

We assume homogeneous mixing of the population (reasonable at least locally for a vector-borne disease). We also fix a particular value of R0 for each calculation, and assume this value is maintained until the epidemic has swept through a population. In reality, R0 will vary seasonally as vector abundance, extrinsic incubation period, and other factors vary. The existence of a high-transmission season might enhance the benefits of fractional-dose vaccination. Most importantly, there will be a premium on achieving high vaccine coverage before the peak of transmission to maximally impact transmission, and this will be limited by supply constraints that could be partially relieved by fractionation. However, the cases-averted estimates might not all be achieved in a single transmission season if seasonal declines in mosquito abundance abrogate transmission before the large majority of the population has become infected.",
