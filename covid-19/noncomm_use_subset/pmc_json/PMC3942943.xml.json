            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated progressive infectious disease of\ndomestic cats and wild felids caused by infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV), a\nsingle-stranded RNA virus classified as Alphacoronavirus [1, 28]. It is divided\ninto effusive FIP, in which exudate is observed in the body cavity, and non-effusive FIP, in\nwhich multiple pyogranuloma lesions are formed, but differences in lesions are influenced by\nthe immunity of individuals [3]. This disease is\nconsidered to be induced by a mutant of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), FIP virus (FIPV)\n[8, 26]. The\nincidence is generally about 1% in FCoV-infected cats, but it varies depending on the age,\nbreed, environment and superinfection with other viruses [7, 8, 17, 23]. There are 2 genotypes of FCoV, and\nFCoV type II is considered to arise by recombination between FCoV type I and canine\ncoronavirus (CCoV) [9, 27]. Based on serological and genetic investigations, FCoV type I is overwhelmingly\ndominant over FCoV type II, and mixed infection with both types is not rare [6, 11, 14, 15]. Since FIPV\nand FECV cannot be distinguished serologically or genetically, it is generally difficult to\ndiagnose FIP [1], but it has been stated that the\ndemonstration of FCoV RNA in ascites is one of most reliable diagnostic indicators of FIP\n[3, 10].\nSeveral results concerning the state of FIP incidence have been reported overseas [6, 15, 16, 18, 29]. In Japan, there have been several reports on the\nprevalence of FCoV infection [11, 13, 20, 24], but, to our knowledge, no studies on FIP prevalence have been\nreported. Thus, in this study, to investigate the state of FIP incidence in Japan, we examined\nFCoV RNA in ascites of domestic cats suspected of having FIP using RT-PCR and investigated the\ngenotype of detected FCoV RNA.",

Similarly,\nin this study, the positivity of the 3\u2019-UTR gene was significantly higher in purebreds than in\ncrossbreds, particularly in the Norwegian forest cat and Scottish fold, whereas the positivity\nwas lower in the American shorthair. However, in previous reports from the U.S.A. and\nAustralia, the incidence of FIP was high in the Abyssinian, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Ragdoll\nand Rex and the Australian mist, British shorthair, Burmese and Rex, respectively, and low in\nthe Burmese, Exotic shorthair, Manx, Persian, Russian blue and Siamese and the Persian,\nrespectively [16, 18]. These breeds are inconsistent with our findings. The breeds that had high and\nlow positivity in this study are consistent with FCoV antibody prevalence in Japan [24]. These findings indicate that countries and regions\nvary in the incidence of FIP by breed, and the prevalence of FCoV in breeding colonies seems\nto be closely related to the incidence, rather than bloodlines.",

At younger\nthan 1 year of age, the positivity was significantly higher in purebreds than in crossbreds,\nindicating high prevalence of FCoV in multi-cat households, such as pet shops and breeding\ncatteries [8]. The positivity was also significantly\nhigher in males than in females, as previously reported [6, 16, 17, 29]. However, no gender difference has\ngenerally been noted in the antibody prevalence in previous studies [5, 12, 20, 24], indicating that FIP more\nfrequently develops in males among FCoV-infected cats, although no serological data were shown\nin this study. This may be due to the influences of the stress of fighting and infectious\ndiseases, such as feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, since\nthese viruses more frequently infect males than females [22]. On investigation by season, the positivity tended to increase in fall-winter. A\nsimilar tendency has been reported in the U.S.A. [19],\nsuggesting the seasonality of FIP development. This may be related to weather and the estrus\ncycle.",
