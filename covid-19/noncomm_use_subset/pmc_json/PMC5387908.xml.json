All of them were included, but 2 of them were excluded as it was new and not all specialties and operations were established yet, and there was a fire accident near the place at the time of data collection. The study was limited to hospitals with a capacity of 100 or more beds as such organizations were assumed to be more inclusive in their technical, administrative, and institutional structures and could have a role during disaster of MCIs.",
