            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an oncogenic, mucosa-infecting, and etiologic agent that causes over 90% of cases of cervical cancer in the world.1,2 The genome of HPV consists of three regions, viz, noncoding region (extended control), and nonstructural (E1\u2013E7) and structural regions (L1, L2) of the open reading frames.3,4 Briefly, E1 protein is the ATP-dependent DNA helicase which is involved in replication. E2 protein acts as a regulator of viral gene transcription and genome replication. E4 and E5 proteins are involved in the early and late phases of the virus life cycle and immune modulation. E6 and E7 proteins are involved in cell differentiation and targeting numerous negative regulators of the cell cycle (tumor suppressor genes p105Rb and p53). The assemblage of L1 and L2 proteins in capsomers results in the formation of icosahedral capsids around the viral genetic material during formation of progeny.5,6 Identification of CD8+ antigenic determinants is crucial in vaccine development.7 Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are also known as killer cells or CD8 cells matured from the thymus of a specific primary lymphoid organ of the human immune system. CD8+ T cells play a vital role in cell-mediated immune responses against invading intracellular foreign substances like viruses.8 In addition to CD8+ T cells, the peptides of CD4+ T cells are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which are located in the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), to trigger immune response. Therefore, CD4+ cells are also known as T helper (Th) cells. Initially, APC identifies the pathogen-associated molecular pattern by toll-like receptors (TLRs) which results in the cleavage of antigen into small fragments. Then, MHC class II peptides complex activates the naive CD4+ Th cells and triggers CD8+-mediated cellular immune response or B cell-mediated humoral immune response. Interestingly, when the antigen complexes with MHC class I directly, it results in CD8+-mediated cellular immune response.9,10 The detection of CTL epitopes and the stimulation of immune response play a critical role in an individual\u2019s immune system.",

HPV45 is a member of HPV18 alpha papillomaviridae family and a species of \u03b17.22\u201324 Moreover, the prevalence rate of HPV45 in cases of cervical cancer was found to be high varying from 1.6% to 37.4% which was recorded in different geographical regions such as Ghana, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Pakistan, USA, Japan, Burkina Faso, Northern parts of China, Southeast regions of Brazil, and Northeast of India.18,25\u201332 Difference in the host genetic framework and oncogenicity of the circulating variants might play a critical role in geographical distribution of HPV45. Together with HPV16 and 18, HPV45 is highly recorded in cases of squamous cell carcinoma (75%) and adenocarcinoma (94%), and in cases of invasive cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3.2,16,33 Based on the level of enrichment in cervical cancer cases compared to women with normal cytological features, HPV45 has been suggested as the third highest oncogenic agent next to HPV16 and 18.1,30,34,35 In comparison to other hrHPV types, limited reports exist about the peptide research in HPV45.",

Instant accessibility of open databases and informatic tools suggest efficient methods to develop vaccines with reduced time, labor, and experimental cost.36,37 Several studies reported that virtual peptides of HPV16 and 18 oncoproteins (E6 and E7) efficiently induce immune response in cervical cancer patients as revealed by their peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples.38\u201342 However, cross-protection against all the hrHPV strains could not be ignored.40 The cross-reactivity of CTL peptide is suspected to play an essential role in producing immune response against multiple strains.43 Selection of immunogenic epitopes from the whole genome of hrHPV strains may enable designing of novel CTL vaccines. Therefore, we identified the potential immunogenic CD8+, CD8+-overlapped CD4+, and B-cell epitopes from the antigenic proteins of HPV45 and anticipated an epitopes pool with the capability to demonstrate immunogenic responses against all 15 hrHPV strains. The workflow of the study is illustrated in Figure 1.",

The \u03b1-chain of MHC class I contains the peptide-binding domain, immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region. The heavy chain of the MHC class I molecule is coded by the genes at HLA (A, B, and C) loci. The MHC genes are highly polymorphic in nature; it means the residues in the N- and C-terminal regions of MHC proteins could generate clefts for specific peptide binding. MHC class I alleles exhibit broader binding specificity for peptides between 1,000 and 10,000 amino acids with high promiscuity.86 Neural networks based on computational approaches have played a vital role in the prediction of the binding affinity of a peptide for specific MHC molecules.87 In the present study, the FTFPHAFPF, CVSYWGVYY, LTAEVMSYI, and FSDPSIIEV antigenic epitopes were found to interact with more number of HLA alleles. This specific high-binding affinity is absolutely desired because the efficiency of an epitope in vaccine development greatly depends on the extent of its interaction with HLA alleles. Moreover, activated CD8+ cells kill the targets through three crucial mechanisms including secretion of antitumor and antiviral (IFN-\u03b3) substances,88 membrane disruption by granulysin, and Fas-mediated killing.89",

It is notable that the prophylactic vaccines from HPV L1 protein are used to treat HPV infections in more than 100 countries.97 In the present study, we found strong binding affinity between the predicted L1 epitope LTAEVMSYI and three different MHC class I alleles HLA-A*(02:06, 02:01, 68, 58:01). Moreover, studies reported that multi-epitope HPV16 E6/E7 vaccine enhanced the clearance of HPV-positive cancer in the mouse model.98,99 TA-CIN vaccine was synthesized from a single fusion protein of HPV16 (L2, E6, and E7), and the clinical Phase I study in healthy volunteers showed significant production of IFN-\u03b3 which confirmed T-cell immune response in patients.100 In the present study, minor capsid protein FSDPSIIEV epitope showed affinity for a peptide-binding groove with allele-specific pockets in MHC class I HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*68:02, and HLA-C*15:02 alleles.

            "text": "Both MHC class I and II molecules share some superficial similarities and bind to the 9mer peptides.101 However, vital differences exist between the MHC class I and II molecules. The capped nature of the MHC class I peptide-binding groove with allele-specific pockets does not allow variation in the length of peptides (9mer), which is called register shifting. This is because the peptide-binding groove of MHC class I molecules is closed at each end. In contrast, the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules is open at both ends which allows for binding of more extended peptides (ranging from >15 to 24 AA in length). Sercarz and Mav-erakis102 reported that longer peptides have peptide-flanking residues that lie outside of the peptide-binding groove in MHC class II molecules and might interact with peptides in another distal location. MHC class II proteins primarily present peptides derived from endocytosis of extracellular proteins (exogenous processing pathway). In the present study, promising 15mer CD4+ epitopes were predicted by consensus approaches from the late and early proteins of HPV45. The predicted CD4+ epitopes possessed good binding affinity (<1% lowest percentile rank) for MHC class II alleles. CD4+ immune responses are associated with the production of IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2. Furthermore, the IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ epi-topes were found by using machine learning hybrid method. B cell-mediated humoral immunity involves the recognition of antigens circulating in the body fluid. Recently, Paolini et al103 reported the production of CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes induced by anticancer pVAX-E5CP and pVAX-E5MultiCP E5 vaccine (carrying the whole E5 gene or multi-epitope) in the preclinical cancer model. Bristo et al104 reported that immunization with a single peptide that contained both the CD4+ and CD8+ CTL epitopes (ie, 9mer CD8+ MHC class I-restricted peptides nested within the 13mer CD4+ epitopes) elicited the response and production of T cells in an animal model. We also predicted the CD8+-overlapped (9mer) epit-opes within the ideal B-cell (16mer) and CD4+ cell (15mer) epitope regions. The results suggested that the CD8+, nested CD4+, or B-cell epitopes may elicit CTL-induced cellular immunity or T cell-induced adaptive immunity or B cell-mediated humoral immunity. These identified epitopes from HPV45 may have substantial implications in the peptide vaccine-based immunotherapy.",
