Here, we investigated the presence of MAstV5 using RT-PCR in fecal samples from dogs of different ages with and without diarrhea. The partial genomes of selected MAstV5 RNA-positive samples were also sequenced to perform a phylogenetic analysis comparing them with the MAstV5 sequences described in the literature as the cause of enteric disease.18, 20, 23, 26 Additionally, MAstV5 was proposed to be classified in four putative genotypes.",

The animal's age was recorded and ranked from puppy (equal or less than one-year-old) to adult dog (more than one-year-old); some samples from dogs of unknown age were included. Animals not presenting diarrhea at the time of sampling were considered asymptomatic and those presenting clinical signs of enteric disease diarrhea were classified as symptomatic. Samples were diluted to 20% (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further analysis. Subsequently, viral DNA isolation from the supernatant was performed using a commercial kit (NewGene Preamp\u00ae, Simbios Biotecnologia, Brazil) based on guanidine isothiocyanate and silica.27 Viral RNA was isolated using TRIzol\u00ae LS Reagent (Life Technologies\u2122, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

The partial genome sequences of MAstV5 obtained in the present study and those available in GenBank, together with selected Mamastrovirus reference sequences from other species, generated two evolutionary trees (Fig. 2). Forty-three reference strains and the four sequences from this study corresponding to 19 Mamastrovirus species were delineated with high bootstrap support throughout the entire tree (Fig. 2A). In the MAstV5 clade, all of the present sequences clustered with \u201cGillingham/2012/UK\u201d (GenBank accession number NC_026814), although with low amino acid identities of approximately 80% (Table 2). Consequently, these four new sequences grouped within Chinese sequences, suggesting a different genotype putatively named as MAsTV5a (Fig. 2B). Through a pairwise comparison of the ORF2 nucleotide sequence, a high degree of nucleotide identity, ranging from 95% to 99%, was detected among the Brazilian type strains of this study. The study sequences showed a closer relationship with the Chinese strains grouping in genotype a. More distant strains were observed among the HUN/2012/126 (GenBank accession number KX599352) Hungary strain composing the genogroup b, Bari/2008_ITA (GenBank accession number HM045005) and Gillingham/2012/UK (GenBank accession number NC_026814) strains from Italy and United Kingdom, respectively, grouping in the genotype c, and finally, forming the genotype d, HUN/2012/115 (GenBank accession number KX599351), HUN/2012/126 (GenBank accession number KX599352) strains from Hungary and GI.E/Dog/ITA/2010/Zoid (GenBank accession number JN193534) strain from Italy.

Likewise, non-viral agents and factors such as bacteria, intestinal parasites, malnutrition and intoxications are able to promote enteric disease mainly in the young dog population. The search for other enteric viruses in the MAstV5-positive samples from dogs with gastroenteritis showed that the dogs were also infected with other known pathogens. Moreover, we found that single MAstV5 infection was associated only with the asymptomatic state, although there is a risk that the results will be biased, since the analyzes were conducted on the basis of convenience sampling and we can not exclude the possibility that the long term of viral shedding could be an explanation for the MAstV5-positive samples detected in asymptomatic dogs, based on previous study that demonstrated the comparison between virus load and clinical manifestation26 (Fig. 1 and Table 3). These findings were not unexpected, as mixed infections are common, but more studies will be necessary to real deduce the role of MAstV5 in the cases reported here.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24",

Therefore, the association with clinical signs and the shedding of the virus was described only in a case study of 2 animals, which is apparently an isolated case.26 A prevalence study in France found that 21% (66/316) of the puppies in 42% (14/33) of the breeding kennels surveyed were MAstV5 positive, as determined using RT-PCR.21 In the same report, the authors observed that puppies that were less than 7 weeks old were especially susceptible to MAstV5 infection, although a direct association with clinical signs was not possible.21 Lastly, recent studies found a MAstV5 prevalence of 6% in the United Kingdom and an infection rate of 33% in puppies under three months in Japan.22, 23",
