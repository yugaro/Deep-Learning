In brief, patients age \u22656 months with MAARI were enrolled from the population of community-dwelling individuals living in the central region of the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA), a dynamic, population-based cohort of approximately 54 000 residents living in 14 zip codes surrounding Marshfield, Wisconsin. Nearly all MESA residents receive their medical care from Marshfield Clinic, an integrated, multispecialty healthcare system serving the MESA population. The Marshfield Clinic electronic medical record captures approximately 93% of outpatient visits, 93% of hospital discharges, and 99% of deaths for the MESA population [13, 14]. This study focused on children living in MESA who were 6\u201359 months old at the start of each influenza season. Although data on race and ethnicity were not collected during all study seasons, US Census data from 2010 indicate that 94% of Marshfield residents are white, non-Hispanic.",

Nucleic acid was extracted from the swabs using the Roche MagnaPure 2.0 system and was then amplified using RT-PCR with target-specific primers. Target-specific signals were determined by voltammetry, a process that generates electrical signals from ferrocene-labeled signal probes. We validated the GenMark multiplex assay RSV A and B against singleplex assays developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sensitivity and specificity was 98% and 99%, respectively, for RSV (unpublished data, 2012). Other investigators have reported 99% overall agreement between the GenMark multiplex assay and corresponding singleplex RT-PCR for respiratory viruses in children [15].",

Incidence calculations were based on 2 assumptions. First, we assumed that test results from enrolled patients with MAARI can be extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members with a respiratory illness visit during the enrollment period. Visits for ARI were based on ICD-9 codes (specific codes available on request). Although rare, some study participants did not receive a diagnosis code for ARI because enrollment eligibility was based on presenting symptoms rather than ICD-9 codes that were assigned after the visit. Test results for these participants were not extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members.",

These 2 periods were summed to generated the standardized combined estimate as described above. This was necessary because extrapolation of influenza positivity rates among patients enrolled during the pandemic to cohort members who had MAARI later in the season (when influenza was largely absent) would not be appropriate.

The analysis data set comprised enrolled patients. Enrolled patients that did not receive an ICD-9 code for ARI were assigned analytic weights of 1.0. Otherwise, analytic weights equal to the inverse of the proportion of cohort members with MAARI that were enrolled were assigned within strata defined by age group (6\u201311, 12\u201323, and 24\u201359 months) and season. These analytic weights were then multiplied by the appropriate adjustment factors as described above. The outcome in the regression models was the dichotomous virus test result (coded 1 = positive, 0 = negative). The offset terms were stratified by season and age group. Within each stratum, the offset was the natural logarithm of the following quantity: number of cohort members divided by the sum of analytic weights.

We were unable to estimate incidence in younger children because they were not eligible for enrollment in the vaccine effectiveness study from which our data were obtained. The incidence among children 6\u201323 months old was approximately double the incidence in those 24\u201359 months old. In contrast, the incidence of medically attended influenza was highest among children 24\u201359 months old. The seasonal incidence of both RSV and influenza was highest during the 2007\u20132008 season when A/H3N2 was the dominant circulating influenza virus. The overall incidence of influenza was similar in 2007\u20132008 and during 2009\u20132010, which included the pandemic. In the latter season, the vast majority of influenza cases occurred in the pandemic wave that affected the community in October and November 2009. The lowest incidence of both viruses occurred in 2006\u20132007 when seasonal A/H1N1 accounted for the majority of influenza cases. These findings add to the evidence that the burden of RSV is high during the first 24 months of life, and they emphasize the need for a safe and effective intervention to prevent RSV in infants and toddlers.",

Some differences may be attributed to the study design and source population. We recruited from a well defined and stable population cohort with complete healthcare utilization data, and we used the same cohort to generate RSV and influenza incidence estimates. Surveillance, active recruitment, and testing occurred during the months when RSV and influenza activity were highest, and we used data from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to estimate the number of additional cases that would have been captured if we had enrolled continuously from week 40 through week 18. This approach created a high level of internal validity. In the NVSN study, results from participating children were applied to national survey data (NAMCS), and the lower RSV incidence may reflect differences in healthcare utilization for ARI at the national level compared with the communities where studies were conducted. The IISP used a convenience sample to obtain viral diagnostic test results, and there was a potential for selection bias with the use of clinical diagnostic testing. It is also unclear whether all respiratory illness visits were captured, because the analysis included only visits to the primary medical provider.",

Although we do not have data on children younger than 6 months, our data suggest that children aged 6\u201311 and 12\u201323 months have RSV infections that require medical care at similar rates in the Marshfield population.",

The estimated population incidence of outpatient influenza visits in NVSN was 500 per 10 000 children 0\u201359 months old in the 2002\u20132003 season and 950 in the 2003\u20132004 season [21]. We observed similar incidence rates among Marshfield children during a different time period. Direct comparisons are difficult because influenza incidence can vary greatly from season to season, and patterns of healthcare utilization can vary over time. In addition, progressive increases in vaccine recommendations and coverage in children over the past decade may have influenced the number of influenza-related outpatient visits.",

We included outpatient medically attended infections, and children with asymptomatic RSV or mild, nonmedically attended illness were not included.

The length of the enrollment period was relatively short\u2014only 10\u201312 weeks during each season except the 2009\u20132010 season, which had an extended enrollment period due to the pandemic. We addressed this by using state surveillance data to estimate the proportion of cases occurring outside our enrollment window, but we do not know whether state surveillance data are a valid measure of RSV activity in the community outside the enrollment period. We did not enroll children <6 months of age when serious RSV infections may occur. As a result, we were unable to estimate RSV and influenza incidence in this age group. Rhinoviruses along with RSV and influenza were the majority of viruses detected. However, statewide data combines enterovirus and rhinovirus groups due to genetic similarity. Therefore, we were unable to estimate the proportion of rhinovirus cases occurring outside our enrollment period and did not estimate the incidence of medically attended rhinovirus infections. Finally, we did not detect human bocavirus because the multiplex PCR array did not include it. This may have contributed to the relatively small proportion of children who were coinfected with multiple viruses [22].",
