Synthetic biology includes technologies for DNA synthesis and assembly of fragments of DNA for gene synthesis, sometimes referred to as synthetic genomics. Craig Venter, a pioneer in this area, has described synthetic biology in a video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvBV2qnSZwo). Genome engineering includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes and goes beyond traditional genetic engineering. Metabolic engineering can be used to manipulate metabolic pathways for correction of metabolic disorders and can also be applied to microorganisms to produce chemicals more efficiently than by genetic engineering. Synthetic biology devices contribute not only to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms, but also provide novel diagnostic tools. Methods based on synthetic biology enable the design of novel strategies for the treatment of cancer, immune diseases metabolic disorders and infectious diseases as well as the production of cheap drugs [2]. The potential of synthetic genome, using an expanded genetic code that is designed for specific drug synthesis as well as delivery and activation of the drug in vivo by a pathological signal has been reported [3].",

As an initial step toward achieving this goal, synthetic proteins have been created that can function in Escherichia coli. Using a so-called binary code method that relies on strategic placement of polar and non-polar residues, a team of scientists made more than a million stably folded strings of amino acids from genetic sequences distinct from those known to occur naturally [11]. They then screened these synthetic proteins in dozens of E. coli strains missing essential genes, identifying artificial proteins that could substitute for the organism's own proteins. They are molecular machines that function quite well within a living organism even though they were designed from scratch and expressed from artificial genes. They found that 18 of the artificial proteins could rescue the growth of 4 E. coli mutant strains missing the essential enzyme-coding genes serB, gltA, ilvA or fes. The information encoded in these artificial genes does not come from and is not significantly related to information encoded by natural genes, and yet the end result is a living, functional microbe. The synthetic proteins are substantially less active and may function by different mechanisms than the natural proteins they replace. Nonetheless, co-expression of several novel proteins rescues a strain in which multiple natural genes were deleted simultaneously. This work suggests that the construction of artificial genomes capable of sustaining cell life is feasible. Synthesis of therapeutic proteins by this approach has not been explored as yet.",

An example of the potential application of this approach is brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme), which is one of the most challenging cancers, and efforts to cure it have failed in over 100 years of history of modern neurosurgery. The challenge is due to complete eradication required for cure as even a few residual cells multiply rapidly with recurrence of the tumor that kills the patient. Response to conventional treatments such as surgical resection and chemotherapy varies according to the characteristics of individual tumors, but none are curative.",

The findings of this commission were published in December 2010. \u2018The recommendations detailed in this report provide a publicly accountable basis for ensuring that the field of synthetic biology advances to improve human health and public welfare with processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks on an ongoing basis as the field matures. Risk assessment should precede field release of the products of synthetic biology. Ongoing assessment and review is required in several areas to avoid unnecessary limits on science and social progress, and to ensure appropriate restrictions to protect individual safety and our shared environment. Ongoing dialogue about concerns regarding the implications of synthetic biology for humans, other species, nature, and the environment should continue as synthetic biology develops from its infancy to a fully mature field of scientific inquiry and innovation\u2019 [38].",
