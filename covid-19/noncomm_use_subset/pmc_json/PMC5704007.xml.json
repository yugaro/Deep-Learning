Since the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d concept was described about a hundred years ago by Paul Ehrlich 1, scientists in medicine, pharmaceutical, and material science have been trying to discover or create sophisticated drugs that target specific molecules, cells, and tissues. DDS is one of the key technologies that can deliver drugs to target sites in the body. Numerous types of nanomaterials, including liposomes (LPs) and polymers, have been investigated as a DDS, some of which are now used in clinical settings 2-4. These nanomaterials contain drug molecules by encapsulation, physical adsorption, or chemical linkage, and deliver them to the target. Nanoformulation of a drug can avoid renal excretion and allow prolonged circulation in the body 5, which contributes to improved bioavailability. Moreover, nano-sized materials can passively accumulate at tumor tissues or at sites of inflammation site via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 6. When the nanoformulation contains a targeting moiety, it can recognize specific target molecules in the body and accumulate at the specific site in the body 7.",

            "text": "However, some researchers have cautioned that the current DDS technology remains far from the true \u201cmagic bullet\u201d. One meta-analysis revealed that only 0.7% of total nanoparticles (NPs) administered in vivo accumulates at the target tumor tissues 8. Almost all (over 99%) of the drugs accumulate at non-target tissues or are cleared from body. Furthermore, in the clinical setting, human tumors sometimes do not exhibit an EPR effect 9. Current DDS studies have been summed up as \u201cmany papers, few drugs\u201d 10,11. This situation reflects the complexity of nanocarriers compared to parental drugs. Furthermore, despite the contrary expectation, active targeting DDS only slightly improves the pharmacokinetics and accumulation of drugs into target tissues compared to non-targeting formulations. Cytoplasmic delivery is another issue of DDS. For the delivery of nucleic acid medicines, such as plasmid DNA, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA), drug molecules should be delivered to the nucleus or cytoplasm of target cells to exert their biological function 12. Nucleic acids do not inherently penetrate cell membranes and have to be intracellularly delivered via a DDS. After the cellular uptake of these drugs, endosomal escape is a rate-limiting step 13. Even in the cutting-edge lipid NP platform, only 1 to 2% of cargo siRNA escapes from the endosome to the cytoplasm, to elicit RNA interference 14.",

            "text": "While synthetic nanocarriers remain hampered by these issues, viruses have naturally evolved to deliver genetic materials (DNA or RNA genome) into host cells in an elaborate and rational fashion. After the entry into host body, viruses can evade host defense and reach specific organs or cells. Once viruses are taken up by cells, they traffic the intracellular space and release their genome to replicate themselves. Viruses exploit their protein and lipid components to surmount cellular barriers. DDS technology can learn a great deal from viruses. Bio-inspired materials are being investigated for a wide variety of applications, such as in material science and biomedical research. These materials have unique characteristics and functions compared to human-designed materials 15. Recombinant viruses have already been utilized as delivery systems in gene therapy 16. However, natural virus-based DDS has inherent safety issues, including immunogenicity and insertion of genetic information of virus into host genome. Several clinical trials failed due to the safety problem of viral vectors 17. Ideally, the infection machinery should be transplanted from viruses to artificial NPs to avoid the intrinsic and unexpected toxicity of viruses. In this review, we summarize the machinery that operates early in the viral infection process, which can hopefully be utilized as a virus-inspired DDS. We focus on the evasion of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), tissue tropism, cell entry, and endosomal escape. Current approaches to develop virus-inspired DDSs are described. In the final section of this review, we summarize our strategy to develop virus-inspired DDS by mimicking the infection machinery of hepatitis B virus (HBV).",

Spherical viruses include human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), influenza virus (IFV), HBV, and adeno associated virus. Non-spherical viruses are rod-like or elliptical in shape (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)). Most viruses are spherical, although different subviral structures can be present. For example, HBV specifically infects human liver cells. The virion is an approximately 42 nm-sized spherical structure termed as the Dane particle 24. Subviral particles of HBV can be found in the patients' plasma. Interestingly, different from the Dane particle, another particle is spherical with an approximate diameter of 22 nm and still another particle is filamentous and lacks genetic materials. The biological function of both particles is unclear 25. Recently, it was postulated that subviral particles may be a decoy for the neutralizing antibodies produced against the HBV virion 26.",

At lower viral protein concentrations, TMV can form a 50-nm spherical structure. In mice, rod-shaped structures have a longer circulating time in bloodstream and are cleared less rapidly from tissues than spherical-shaped structures, indicating that viral shape plays an important role in biodistribution 27,28. However, the effect of natural viruses' shape on their immune evasion has been difficult to study. To overcome this barrier, different methods have evaluated viral behavior in the bloodstream, including virus-mimicking or gold NPs as a model. The intent of this model is to simulate the features that could influence immune evasion 29,30. For example, rod-shaped gold NPs modified with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) accumulate in the liver to a lesser extent, and circulate longer in the blood compared to spherical NPs 31.",

The strategy of evasion mechanism includes both interference with antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and evasion from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by antigenic variation. The CTLs recognize viral antigens on the MHC class I and activate antiviral immune system 41. Some viruses utilize these unique \u201cactive\u201d evasion mechanisms to achieve a prolonged circulation time in bloodstream. For example, the glycoprotein gp42 of the Epstein-Barr virus interacts with MHC-II molecules, where it hinders antigen presentation to CD4+ T-cells 42. In the case of HIV-1, the envelope protein gp120 binds to CD4 molecules and inhibits the interaction of CD4 and MHC-II 43. The envelope protein E2 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) binds to CD81, which prevents natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis and cytokine release 44.",

This strategy operates early in the infection of a host cell, following virion secretion. Lipid and protein derived from the host cell are utilized. The strategy operates in the evasion of the complement system, a major non-specific host defense mechanism 45. Cowpox virus is equipped with an inhibitor of complement (i.e., the inflammation modulatory protein), which inhibit the production of C3a and C5a during the infection 46. Viruses including human cytomegalovirus and vaccinia virus utilize similar strategy, by incorporating host CD59 proteins in to the envelope, resulting in the protection from complement lysis 20,47. The complement system consisting of the classic, alternative, and lectin pathways, is also important in the immune response 48, which recognizes invading pathogens and activates antiviral activities 49. However, some viruses can evade these complement systems. For example, the HIV-1 envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41) 50 and the West Nile virus NS1 51 bind to factor H, which regulates the alternative pathway of complement activation in the bloodstream and on the cell surface 52. In the case of HIV-1, the amino acid sequence 105-119 of gp41 was indicated to interact with factor H immediately after dissociation of the envelope complex 53.",

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs in all cell types and necessary for the turnover of membrane proteins and lipids, uptake of nutrients 83. Viruses exploit the clathrin-mediated endocytosis process to gain entry to host cells, as shown in Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 84,85, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 86, HCV 87, ADV 88, and dengue virus 89. The clathrin-mediated endocytosis carries cargo molecules from the plasma membrane to early endosomes within 2 min. 59. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of viruses is generally quick. In the case of dengue virus, the virus particle firstly moves along the plasma membrane for about 2 minutes before associating with clathrin-containing domains. Next, the virus is delivered to the late endosomes within 5.5 min after cell entry, and fused with endosomal membrane within 12.5 min 59,89. Following the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the virus cargo is transported to the early endosome within several minutes by the help of Rab5 protein. Some viruses immediately move to late endosome by a switch of Rab subsets 90 and start to fuse with endosomal membrane in acidic condition within several minutes 79.",

Generally, the fusogenic domain of envelope proteins is responsible for this process. Under the acidic conditions in late endosome, the fusion protein undergoes a conformational change, leading to the insertion of hydrophobic fusogenic domain into the endosomal membrane to form a dehydration interface and hemifusion stalk. In case of IFV, the HA protein undergoes a conformational change after protonation at acidic pH, leading to the fusion peptide with an exposed helical structure, which results in the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes 96. This membrane fusion mechanism was found in other viral envelope proteins including SFV E1 protein 97 and HIV-1 gp41 protein 98. Although low pH is important for the structural change of viral proteins, some viruses have different suitable conditions. For example, SFV and VSV fuse with early endosomal membrane at relatively high pH (~pH 6), whereas IFV typically fuses with late endosome membrane at lower pH (~pH 5).",

The aforementioned infection machineries involved in tropism, cell entry, and endosomal escape are mainly mediated by viral proteins. The virus tropism could be simply transplanted to synthetic nanocarriers by the conjugation of the host cell receptor-recognition domain of viral protein. The synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of the HBV envelope L protein (e.g., myristoylated pre-S1(2-47) peptide) interacts with the high-affinity HBV receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) 108. When this peptide is conjugated with synthetic nanocarriers, such as LPs 109, and lipoplex (complex of cationic LPs and plasmid DNA) 110, they can target human hepatic cells specifically. The tropism of HBV is strictly limited to human hepatocyte probably due to the restricted expression of the HBV receptor NTCP in hepatocytes 108. Thus, these HBV-mimicking strategies are expected as highly specific to liver and therefore may reduce the side-effect in non-liver organs.",

In the case of enveloped viruses, viral proteins require a lipid bilayer from the host cell membrane for the assembly of VLPs. As VLPs are fully composed of viral components, they might functionally resemble the parental viruses. To date, various types of VLPs from a broad range of virus have been studied for drug delivery applications 120. VLPs of human papilloma virus were utilized for the delivery of plasmid DNA 121. After the intramuscular injection of papilloma virus VLPs with plasmid DNA in mice, plasmid DNA was successfully delivered to antigen presenting cells and gene expression was induced. This platform is useful for the delivery of DNA vaccine to elicit a functional immune reaction against pathogens. Furthermore, VLPs can be modified to deliver protein cargos by fusing the components of VLPs and therapeutic proteins. In a study of engineered VLPs of SV40, minor SV40 VP2/3 proteins were fused with model proteins (EGFP or yeast cytosine deaminase) and incorporated into VLPs composed of major VP1 proteins. The engineered VLPs could functionally deliver the encapsulated proteins into cells 118. Interestingly, VLPs may resemble the biodistribution of parental viruses upon the administration into the host. For example, oral administration of rotavirus VLPs is followed by their penetration to ileum and colon 122. These VLPs are of interest for the delivery of drugs to the gastrointestinal tract.",

Since no effective anti-HBV drug is available, anti-HBV vaccination is important for the protection from infection. Therefore, recombinant HBV subviral particles have been produced since 80s by using eukaryotic cells as immunogens of HB vaccine. Since conventional HB vaccine is composed of HBV envelope S proteins and a LP (also known as hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg), more than 5% of vaccinees have never respond to HB vaccine (i.e., non-/low-responders). For enhancing the antigenicity and immunogenicity of HB vaccine as much as possible, we tried to express a complete envelope protein L (pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S region) as particles in recombinant yeast cells (Fig. 3, left), which was expected to elicit additional HBV-neutralizing antibodies. While many attempts had been made by other researchers to synthesize L particles, the N-terminal sequence of the pre-S1 region strongly inhibited its synthesis. We finally overcame the effect by the N-terminal fusion of a chicken lysozyme-derived signal peptide. We succeeded in the overexpression of L particles in yeast cells (approximately 40% of the total soluble protein) 137. The particles were purified by heating, affinity chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography 138. Hollow and spherical particles with approximately 100 nm in diameter were obtained. One L particle was estimated to contain about 110 L proteins and an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-derived lipid bilayer. The surface localization of the pre-S1 region, pre-S2 region, and a portion of the S region (antigenic loop, AGL) on the L particles was shown to be similar to HBV. Since surface structure of L particles is similar to that of HBV, we utilized L particles as an HBV-inspired nanocarrier. We designated the L particle as bio-nanocapsule (BNC, Fig. 3 right).",

In 2012, NTCP (see chapter 2.2.3.) was at last identified as an essential high-affinity HBV receptor, interacting with the N-terminal myristoylated pre-S1 domain of HBV 108. Since the exogenous expression of NTCP was shown to confer infection susceptibility for HBV in non-susceptible cells and the expression of NTCP is limited in hepatocytes, the hepatotropism of HBV could be well-explained by the existence of NTCP in hepatocytes. In addition to NTCP, HSPG (see chapter 2.2.1.) plays a crucial role in the early infection steps of HBV. Presumably, one of HSPG, glypican 5, attaches to the HBV surface for cell entry 139. Conserved residues in the AGL of S region (see above) could interact with HSPG 140,141, possibly leading to the conformational changes in L protein and facilitating the binding of pre-S1 region to other receptors like NTCP.",

Recently, we identified the cell entry of BNC is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, as well as patient-derived HBsAg particles in human hepatic cells, of which the cell entry speed was almost the same as that of HBV 142. When BNC was chemically conjugated with myristoyl group, essential for the HBV infectivity 143, the Myr-BNC could block the HBV infection in vitro competitively, whereas BNCs slightly 144. Thus, Myr-BNC was shown to utilize the infection machinery of HBV fully. When NTCP was overexpressed in human hepatic cells, we unexpectedly observed no enhancement of cellular uptake of Myr-BNCs, suggesting that NTCP on cell surface could not contribute to the binding with Myr-BNC as well as HBV 144. These observations led us to propose the refined model of the infection mechanism of HBV (Fig. 4). On the surface of human hepatic cells, HSPG (presumably glypican 5 139) may be the main low-affinity receptor for the endocytosis of HBV. Upon endosome maturation, HBV is more likely to bind to NTCP and release their genome into the cytoplasm upon membrane fusion 145. Further details have yet to be determined and await further studies that will clarify how these receptors coordinately work as HBV receptors.",

As described above, viruses have many strategies to evade the immune system with viral protein being key (see chapter 2.1.). Since HBV has polymerized-albumin receptor (PAR) in the pre-S2 region, HBV can bind to polymerized human serum albumin (HSA) 147. When NPs are conjugated with peptide containing PAR, the phagocytosis of NPs by Kupffer cells was reduced (unpublished data).

Additionally, N-form HBV was non-infectious in the in vitro infection experiment, while B-form HBV was highly infectious. However, in the in vivo infection experiment using a mouse xenograft model, the N-form HBV could infect human liver cells, while B-form HBV could not. These results suggested that the HSPG binding is necessary for the infectivity of HBV in vitro, but the HSPG binding allows non-specific accumulation of HBV in non-target tissues and then prevents the liver specific accumulation of HBV. During the blood circulation, HBV may change its structure from N-form to B-form. This unique property of HBV has inspired us to establish nanocarriers that can convert the stealth form to the active form during blood circulation.

HBV was postulated to escapes from endosomes by membrane fusion 157. Previously, three domains have been proposed as fusogenic domain of HBV, including N-terminal part of S region 157, C-terminal half of pre-S2 region 158, and the whole pre-S1 region 159. Nevertheless, it was not fully understood which domain is responsible for the membrane fusion and uncoating of HBV. In 2015, we identified 16-mer low pH-dependent fusogenic domain in the pre-S1 region by using BNCs and peptide-displaying LPs 145. The peptide corresponds to the Asn-9 to Gly-24 in the pre-S1 region. Furthermore, mutation analysis of this fusogenic peptide revealed that the hydrophobicity of the peptide correlates with its fusogenic activity, and Asp-16 and Asp-20 might be crucial for the low-pH dependent fusogenic activity 160. Since the fusogenic activity of BNC was inhibited by the pre-incubation with anti-pre-S1 antibody, the fusogenic domain from Asn-9 to Gly-24 is a dominant region over other fusogenic domains reported previously 145.",

            "text": "As described in the previous review of BNC 156, the NPs for ideal DDS nanocarriers should harbor the following six activities: self-organizing activity, stealth activity, targeting activity, cell entry activity, and endosomal escaping activity. Viruses have evolved to transfer their genetic materials into the nucleus of target cells in vivo, it has thus been considered that viruses are naturally occurring ideal DDS nanocarriers. Whereas most artificial DDS nanocarriers have still been far from the ideal DDS nanocarriers, which harbor a part of the six activities. In this review, we described that BNC is a nearly sole DDS nanocarrier that accomplishes the equipment of all activities. However, for moving to clinical settings, it would be very hard for pharmaceutical companies to develop BNC-based nanomedicines, because the nanomedicines have to be produced under at least two good manufacturing protocol (GMP) guidelines (biologics and chemicals). Thus, these situations have led us to reconstitute the NPs harboring all activities (equal to next-generation BNC) by using chemically defined materials. The concept of next-generation BNC is similar to the non-viral components-based nanocarriers (see chapter 3.2.). For examples, the surface of LPs should be modified with myristoylated pre-S1(2-47) peptide (for targeting and endosomal escaping activity) and pre-S2(120-129) peptide (for stealth activity) to achieve the efficient in vivo delivery and intracellular trafficking in an HBV/BNC-like manner. The weight ratio of these peptides to LPs should be minimized, and the drug encapsulation rate should be maximized. For retargeting of next-generation BNC, the N-terminal part of pre-S1(2-47) peptide (containing NTCP-binding site) should be changed to other targeting molecules (e.g., DNA aptamer, sugar chain, homing peptide, nanobody). Moreover, since nanomicelles and lipid NPs do not require membrane fusion for the endosomal escape of payloads, the fusogenic domain (pre-S1(9-24)) should be replaced with the peptides for membrane pore formation and membrane penetration (see chapters 2.4.2. and 2.4.3.). These strategies for fabricating next-generation BNC might produce ideal DDS nanocarriers, which could deliver drugs and genes in vivo at the same efficiency of parental viruses.",

In the following sections, various virus-inspired nanocarriers, including our platform BNCs, were introduced. According to the low delivery efficacy, conventional nanocarrier-based DDS have been rarely commercialized. Ideally, virus-inspired DDS should resemble the infection machinery of virus while the components are fully synthetic. As mentioned above, some of the infection machineries of virus can be substituted by short peptide that can be chemically synthesized. Furthermore, these short peptides might be less immunogenic than full-length viral proteins. By combining such virus-derived short peptides and synthetic nanocarriers, delivery efficacy of DDS can be improved. The virus-inspired strategy may boost the DDS nanocarriers for the clinical applications.",
