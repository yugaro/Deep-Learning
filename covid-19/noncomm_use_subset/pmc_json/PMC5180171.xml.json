            "text": "Globally, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are among the most widely produced and used nanomaterials (NMs). The estimated global annual production of TiO2NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1,2). This value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3). Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, TiO2NPs are used in diverse applications including consumer, industrial and biomedical fields. The extensive synthesis and pervasive use of TiO2NPs has resulted in unprecedented avenues for human exposure to these materials in the environment and through the use of consumer products. Exposure to TiO2NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents (4,5). Due to their nanosize, TiO2NPs penetrate deep into the highly vascularised areas of lungs and persist in lungs for weeks after the last exposure (6). In addition, TiO2NPs deposited in rodent lungs translocate to blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs (7\u201310). These results imply that exposure to TiO2NPs can negatively impact health of the organisms exposed.",

            "text": "We have previously employed toxicogenomics tools to characterise the pulmonary transcriptomic responses in mice exposed via inhalation (21) or instillation to TiO2NPs of different sizes, surface coatings and TiO2NPs embedded in paint (6). We have shown that all types of TiO2NPs induce pulmonary inflammation via the same mechanisms; however, the severity of response varies with their specific properties (22). The transcriptomic studies discussed above were limited to few TiO2NP types and for now, it is not clear whether the results from those studies can be generalised to all TiO2NP variants. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of lung toxicogenomic responses in mice exposed individually to six different types of TiO2NPs varying in size, crystalline structure and surface coatings to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TiO2NP-induced lung responses. Acute, subchronic and chronic post-exposure time points were included along with a range of doses. The TiO2NP types included anatase TiO2NPs of 8, 20, and 300nm, mixed anatase/rutile TiO2NP of 20nm and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. Mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillation to 18, 54, 162 or 486 \u00b5g/animal doses of individual TiO2NPs. Although the 486 \u00b5g/animal dose is physiologically high, it was included in the study to determine whether exposure to TiO2NPs results in lung pathology at higher doses. Samples were collected at 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity, histopathology, particle localization in lungs (by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cytoviva nanoscale hyperspectral microscopy) were assessed at all three post-exposure time points. Global gene expression profiles were generated for all doses, at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure time points. Pathway tools were employed to characterise the molecular pathways perturbed following exposure to TiO2NPs. Disease similarity tools were employed to determine whether the altered gene expression profiles are associated with any known lung disease.",

All six particles were obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the sponsorship program. The aTiO28 is commercially known as Hombikat UV100 and is available through Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. It is used as a semiconductor catalyst in photocatalytic applications. The aTiO220 and aTiO2300 are commercially available as PC105 and tiona, respectively, from Cristal Global (http://www.cristal.com), whereas, raTiO220 is commercially known as P25 and is available from Evonik Degussa GmbH, Germany. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) are known as UV Titan M262 and UV Titan M212, respectively, and are available from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. The selected anatase TiO2NPs are used in building materials and in air purification systems for their photocatalytic activity. They are also used in self-cleaning fabrics, glass and other products. The raTiO220 NPs are commonly used as catalyst carriers, active components for photocatalytic reactions and as heat stabilizers in silicone rubber. The two functionalised TiO2NPs\u2014rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)\u2014are used in skin and sun care products. The hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) is also used in manufacturing waterproof and stain resistant textiles (23,24).",

A total of 500 cells were counted per cytospin to identify mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes using an optical microscope (Olympus BH2, Olympus Optical Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). A non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey-type test (28) was conducted to examine the effect of doses compared with the matched control using Origin version 8 (Northampton, MA, USA). Two-way ANOVA was conducted that examined the effect of particle and dose for the three post-exposure time points. Data were analysed using the R statistical computing environment (29). The model assumptions for normality and the constant variance assumption were tested using the Anderson\u2013Darling statistic for normality (30) and the Leven\u2019s test for homogeneity of variance (31). However, these assumptions were not satisfied. As a result, the analysis was conducted on the ranks. As the interaction term was significant (P < 0.0001), the post hoc analysis was conducted on the pairwise comparisons. The Holm\u2013Sidak procedure (32) was used to adjust the P values for multiple testing. The estimate and standard error was reported using the untransformed data.",

            "text": "As stated earlier in the introduction above, it is a well-known fact that the primary particle size and the resulting surface area influence the toxicity induced by several classes of NMs including TiO2NPs. For TiO2NP variants, lung exposures leading to acute pulmonary inflammation is suggested to be predominantly dependent on size but also on several other properties such as the surface modifications. However, it is not known whether the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation are the same for all and it is also not clear whether subtle differences in the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation observed for some TiO2NP variants (22) translate into a disease phenotype at a later post-exposure time point. Thus, in the present study, we conducted a detailed assessment of lung responses to six different types of TiO2NPs with varying sizes, modifications and crystalline structures. Although the TiO2NP types investigated in the study were not synthesised in a controlled manner to vary in only one property at a time, from the results of the comprehensive assessment conducted, it can be concluded that the underlying mechanisms of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by TiO2NPs are the same regardless of their properties, which is in alignment with the previous study results published by this research group (22). Also in alignment were the results showing that while size may be the primary determinant of the toxic potential of TiO2NPs, surface modifications influence the severity of the response with hydrophilic surface being more inflammogenic compared with the other types. Halappanavar et al. (22) compared the lung transcriptomic responses in mice exposed to rutile TiO2NPs of 10nm, 38nm and 10nm TiO2NPs with hydrophilic surface and showed that at the transcriptional level, 10nm particles were more responsive with highest number of DEGs. However, surface amination of 10nm TiO2NPs resulting in hydrophilic surface increased the severity of the response (larger fold changes in inflammation-associated genes). The extensive transcriptomic profiling and histopathological analysis conducted in the present study confirm these findings. In the present study, the number of DEGs at Day 1 post-exposure to anatase-type TiO2NPs was remarkably lower for the aTiO2300 with the surface area of 10 m2/g (85 genes) and was highest for the aTiO28 exhibiting 229\u2013235 m2/g (225 genes). While the primary particle size may have been instrumental in the lung responses induced by the anatase type TiO2NPs, for the rutile types [raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)], mixed properties including surface modifications and crystallinity appeared to have influenced the responses. New to the present study was the finding that anatase TiO2NPs were less responsive compared with the rutile/anatase and rutile TiO2NPs at the transcriptional level. Although a direct comparison of responses induced by the anatase and rutile types was not possible as they vary in their surface properties, the overall biological response of mice exposed to anatase type TiO2NPs was less compared with the rutile ones. Previous studies have shown that crystalline structure of TiO2NPs plays an important role in toxicity induced by these particles (16,18).",

It was observed that the number of DEGs induced by rTiO220 (HY) were similar to the number of DEGs induced by aTiO220; however, rTiO220 (HP) induced considerably higher number of genes at all doses and post-exposure time points compared with the other rutile and anatase TiO2NP types. These results suggest that the transcriptional responses to rutile type TiO2NPs are influenced by their surface modifications and that the hydrophilic surface positively impacts the lung responses. Although all rutile types are similar in size and surface area, mixed rutile/anatase type exhibited significantly larger transcriptomic response at the highest dose tested. The raTiO220 has been previously shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the other rutile or anatase only TiO2NPs (41\u201343). The higher activity of raTiO220 compared with that of either pure rutile type can be suggested to be due to the synergistic effects between rutile and anatase crystalline phases (44); however, this could not be confirmed since the present study did not include an unmodified rutile TiO2 type.",

Higher toxicity following exposure to hydrophilic rTiO220 has been shown in rats exposed via inhalation (5). Teubl et al. (45) showed that compared with rTiO220 (HY), the rTiO220 (HP) induces pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential in human buccal epithelial TR146 cells (46). Surface-coated NMs are shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the pristine types; silica-coated rutile TiO2NPs elicit higher pulmonary neutrophilia, in in vivo and in vitro models (5). Rutile TiO2NPs coated with alumina or alumina/silica induce higher inflammation compared with the uncoated TiO2NPs in Sprague Dawley rats (47). In contrast to the above, a study by Warheit et al. showed that the uncoated raTiO220 are more harmful than the alumina or alumina/silica coated TiO2NPs in rats exposed by intratracheal instillation, suggesting that the crystalline structure may also be important (16,18).

NMs that are strongly hydrophobic in nature may non-specifically interact with the cell membrane leading to their internalisation. Preferential cellular uptake of positively charged NMs could be occurring due to the strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cellular membrane (48). Studies also have shown a differential cellular localisation of the hydrophilic TiO2NPs compared with the hydrophobic TiO2NPs (49). The poor interactions with the lipid bilayer may also prolong the life of hydrophilic NPs in blood, which will allow them to reach specific sites and cause toxicity.",

            "text": "The different types of TiO2NPs tested in this study confirmed our previous findings (22) that initial lung responses to TiO2NPs leading to lung inflammation involves similar mechanisms, which includes activation of acute phase signalling and granulocyte and agranulocyte diapedesis pathways resulting in cytokine/chemokine storm and infiltration of neutrophils into lung fluid. However, the magnitude of the observed response was higher and persistent for rutile types and even more pronounced in rTiO220 (HP) group, suggesting that the extent of the response is property specific. Since rTiO220 (HP)-induced expression changes in few of the genes that have known association with lung fibrosis, we compared the gene expression profiles generated from the present study with the gene profiles of lungs of mice exposed to carbon nanotubes that are known to induce lung fibrosis in the same mouse model at similar doses (27,50). A direct comparison of the 69 fibrosis-associated genes described in Poulsen et al. and Snyder-Talkington et al. study (27,50), with DEGs from the present study revealed a low level of concordance with very few overlapping genes (Table 2), which included Timp1, Ccl17, Serpine1, Sod2, Plaur1, Ccl2, Il1rn, Il1b, Ctsk and C3. Considering the fact that TiO2NPs are generally viewed as inert, the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses (162 \u00b5g and 486 \u00b5g/animal) of TiO2NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development and that a full manifestation of fibrosis may require recurring exposure to TiO2NPs at similar dose levels. Alveolar metaplasia has been reported in rat but not in mice following exposure to TiO2NPs in previous studies (51,52). Retention of TiO2NPs in human lung has been reported following cumulative exposures in TiO2NP production plants (53,54). In some of these human cases, exposure to rutile TiO2NPs resulted in mild subpleural fibrosis (6,55\u201358). However, the specific properties of the TiO2NPs that the humans were exposed to are not identified. The results of the present study suggest that the hydrophilic surface may render TiO2NPs with pro-fibrotic potential in the long term when exposed to sufficiently high doses.",

TEM analysis also found particles in the nucleus following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP). These results suggest that some of them may have a potential to induce DNA damage. There are not many in vivo studies that have investigated the DNA damage potential of TiO2NPs. It was shown that a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm aTiO2NPs (60) induce DNA damage and genetic instability in blood cells of mice exposed orally over a short period of time. Intragastric administration of 75nm aTiO2NPs to male Sprague Dawley rats for 30 days (4) was shown to induce genotoxic effects in the bone marrow. However, positive genotoxic effects have not been observed in rodent lungs exposed to TiO2NPs via inhalation (61,62). Although many studies have investigated the genotoxic effects of TiO2NPs using in vitro models, the results are not consistent. For example, AMES assays showed no increases in the mutagenic potential of aTiO2NPs in vitro models. However, DNA damage analysis using comet assays showed that uncoated 20\u201350nm aTiO2NPs tested at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL induced DNA breaks in BEAS2B cells, bottlenose dolphin leucocytes, human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, human epidermal cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (6,55\u201357). One other study showed positive DNA damage potential of 33nm aTiO2NPs in bone marrow and liver of CBAB6F1 mice exposed via gavage (60). However, at present, the properties of TiO2NPs or factors responsible for their DNA damaging potential are not understood.",

The results confirmed our previous findings that the underlying mechanisms leading to TiO2NP-induced lung inflammation acutely after exposure are the same regardless of their properties; however, the results suggested that the long-term pathological effects may be influenced by their specific properties such as crystallinity and surface modifications. Specifically, from the six types tested, a combination of properties such as rutile structure and hydrophilic surface can be deemed as pathologically more active compared to other types. Although TiO2NPs are generally regarded as inert, the results from the study suggest that unfavourable and chronic exposures to very high doses of certain TiO2NP types may result in tissue injury and initiate pro-fibrotic changes in lungs over a long period of time.",
