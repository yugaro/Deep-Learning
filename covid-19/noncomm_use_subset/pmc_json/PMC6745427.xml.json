Also, there is a need to increase vulnerable populations awareness and for health education promotion in schools/universities, culture/faith-based, stands/tribunes, and community/mass gatherings to improve people's knowledge of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, incriminated vectors breeding habitats, biological behavior, disease transmission dynamics, and complications to develop robust and sustainable community-based sanitation and hygiene practices to combat arboviral/zoonotic disease temporal/spatial spread.9,11 Additionally, social media and traditional media options can be used to accelerate community awareness and health education outreach, and acceptance and participation with biocontrol reductionist methods.",

Another biological control measure is the use of fish/copepod predators, which can prey upon, parasitize, and compete with the wild vector and reduce the target vector populations.2,14-16 Deployment of genetically engineered mosquitoes, sugar toxic baits, and biologically new larvicide or adulticide agents' complements are crucial tools in improving biocontrol approaches and strategies and should be used in parallel with insecticide resistance monitoring and development of appropriate countermeasures.17-19 Strengthening local-tailored and proven effective communities' preventive and resilience methods coupled with educative approaches are needed in delivering vulnerable populations coverage against re/emerging public health threats (particularly maternal-child healthcare).13,14 Furthermore, adoption and adaptation of the CDC Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System to improve tracking and monitoring of Zika-related fetal development and birth defects, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and related motherhood and childhood complications in all endemic countries are highly recommended among the local population and expatriate workers. There is also need to establish green space to mitigate climate change as well as to develop a biodiversity conservation culture, which incorporates improved sanitation and drainage systems and mosquito repellants plants and waste management to develop a healthier environment. When introducing Wolbachia into urban or rural communities, it is important to understand mosquito host fitness and coexistence, the influence of biological competition outcomes, and the impact of vector competence as well as the ecological and bacterial profile in control and elimination.",

While concerted efforts in adapting the Sendai Framework Disaster Risk Reduction of United Nations is essential in reducing public health hazards, behavioral and environmental risks and implementing performance-based projects/programs that offer new opportunities for shared Aedes mosquitoes risk/burden reduction engagement in the GCC. Essentially, strengthening laboratory and epidemiological surveillance as well as insecticide resistance and monitoring Aedes mosquito behavior changes is needed to elucidate vector exposure versus immune profile diversity and phylogeography. The approach relies on generating comprehensive data to formulate reliable, effective, and sustainable decision-making policies, which can be used to inform projects and interventions in different vulnerable settings. This includes updates to travel information to protect pilgrims of Hajj and Umrah, and prevention and control packages on Zika, Chikungunya, and dengue co-infections. It has been noted that improving proven conventional entomological indices surveillance and monitoring analysis (i.e., house index; percentage of households with larvae or pupae and container index; percentage of water-holding containers with larvae or pupae/containers and Breteau index; number of positive containers with larvae or pupae per 100 households inspected) is crucial.
