At a policy level, both in Australia and overseas, the increasing worldwide incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EID) of zoonotic origin has precipitated initiatives to foster cross-sectoral co-operation with varying degrees of success [[1], [2], [3], [4]] . In Australia, this includes creation of a number of informal and semi-formal special interest groups (SIGs), with membership largely spanning government (human health and animal health) and academia. To date, both in Australia and overseas, there has been less focus on implementation of One Health in clinical settings [[5], [6], [7]]. This is a recognized gap in Australia, with some SIGs suggesting research into the current knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of general medical practitioners (GPs) and veterinarians with regard to zoonotic disease identification and management is needed to identify pathways for inclusion (S. Britton, personal email communication 19 August 2016).",

GPs and veterinarians are often the \u2018first line\u2019 responders when it comes to recognising, diagnosing, referring and/or treating such diseases in the face of an outbreak. Previous studies have shown that both veterinary and medical practitioners agree that cross professional collaboration can be useful in management of zoonoses [6,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. However, in most countries there are no established pathways to facilitate collaboration and referral across current professional boundaries [6,15]. Further, a significant shift in attitude, as well as development of new legal precedents will be necessary for these approaches to become part of routine clinical practice [6,7,15]. Aside from work by Rabinowitz and Conti which details clinical approaches to zoonoses and other shared risks [16], there is little agreement on what One Health actually looks like in clinical practice.",

We endeavoured to assemble an expert panel with balanced representation of people from both human and animal health backgrounds. An internet search of proposed experts enabled us to identify the backgrounds of most people, with the majority of those from an animal health background having a veterinary degree, and medical practitioners being identified as either infectious diseases or public health medicine specialists. A number of those with an animal health background had expertise in wildlife and ecological health but, as in a previous study in Australia [1], it was difficult to identify One Health \u2018experts\u2019 from a purely environmental health background. This is likely due to the organisational structure of infectious disease management in this country [1]. Due to the location of the researchers, experts were predominantly from New South Wales and Queensland.

Experts were asked to give five responses to each question and were given the option to contribute up to ten answers. This number of responses was selected to maximise the number of topics and opinions without generating an unmanageable amount of qualitative data and is consistent with other Delphi surveys [[17], [18], [19]]. Experts were also asked to identify their occupational affiliation(s) and state(s) or territory(ies) in which they worked in using checkboxes allowing multiple responses. At the end of the survey experts were given an option to provide additional comments. All surveys were anonymous, unless respondents provided their name and email address at the end of the survey. Email invitations to participate in the online survey were sent to potential panel members, with reminder emails sent at approximately two week intervals. The survey was open for eight weeks.

The data were \u2018coded\u2019 into mutually exclusive categories (wherever possible) according to related content and context. We used a manual method to analyse the data which involved reading through the data a number of times to gain understanding of the content, and then using different colours to highlight areas of data which contained similar themes and could be grouped into a broad category or topic area. Two researchers (SM and SS) read and manually coded the Phase One data independently. Each established a list of topics that emerged from the data. They then met to compare findings. Agreement was reached on a list of thirteen topics and subtopics. A list of zoonotic and emerging diseases that were named by Phase One respondents was also compiled. Analysis was done in the context of the stated goals of the survey which was to ascertain expert/specialist opinion regarding topics to prioritise in a future questionnaire of GPs and veterinarians.",

Broader understanding of disease ecology is seen by many as key to curbing the emergence of zoonoses [[25], [26], [27]].

Soliciting information in the clinical history on potential environmental exposures or ecological changes happening in the vicinity of patients/clients' residence (e.g. farmer occupation, new flying fox roosts) would seem salient to the diagnosis and risk assessment of zoonoses in clinical settings.

Recent studies in both Australia and overseas have shown that many veterinarians do not use effective PPE [[28], [29], [30]], and the opinion of the expert panel suggests that this is still an area of concern. It is unclear why members of the expert panel did not place the same importance on PPE for GPs, given that in recent history GPs in Australia and elsewhere have also had significant risk of exposure to EIDs of zoonotic origin transmitted in healthcare settings, such as Ebola and SARS. Studies have suggested that GPs too have insufficient awareness and access to appropriate PPE [[31], [32], [33]]. Perhaps this perception is based on the fact that the risk of exposure to debilitating or fatal zoonotic diseases for GPs is lower and episodic rather than constant.

This may reflect the fact that veterinarians have historically had greater engagement with One Health [6,34,35] and so may be more familiar with definitions of One Health, which includes reference to collaboration [35,36]. Many veterinarians report frustration in the lack of understanding of their knowledge and skill set, and poor engagement by some in the human health sector [34,37]. A similar degree of frustration was expressed in comments made by some of experts in the Phase One survey, often in the context of medical practitioners not being aware of veterinarians' skills and training in risk management of zoonotic disease and inappropriate advice about euthanasia or culling of in-contact animals. A comment by one expert exemplifies this frustration:\u2018Advising the owner to discuss investigating and managing infection and risk factors associated with the animals with their veterinarian RATHER than the Dr providing advice about what to do with the pet (Drs have unnecessarily advised owners to kill pets in the past).

Q fever is the most common direct zoonosis in Australia, with outbreaks being reported in both rural and urban areas, including in veterinary practices [[39], [40], [41], [42]]. These incidents have revealed inadequate workplace health and safety and biosecurity protocols in many Australian veterinary practices, where Q fever vaccination is advised [41,42]. ABLV \u2013 which is similar to rabies virus and is unique to Australia \u2013 has resulted in three human fatalities in Australia, none of which have been veterinarians. However, veterinarians are often consulted following a potential human exposure event, to facilitate testing of bats. This has necessitated a shift in practice where practitioners are advised to not handle bats without a current rabies vaccination.",

Hendra virus is notable for the deaths of four people, including veterinary staff, infected with the virus [43] as well as the controversy about vaccination emphasized by the recent Queensland-based enquiry [44]. However, the disease is primarily of concern only to the subset of practitioners who treat horses in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Anthrax appears rarely in Australia, however there were outbreaks in Queensland and Victoria at the time the survey was conducted [45,46] which may have resulted in its elevated importance in this study. Reports of B. suis in hunting dogs have increased since 2011, especially in New South Wales [47]. Despite no marked increases in human cases [48], the emerging occupational risk to veterinary personnel and clients warrants its high ranking. Many of the zoonoses which were not prioritised are a more likely infection risk to veterinarians and their patients and clients (e.g. ringworm, hookworm). These may have been perceived as less important because they have a lower impact clinically or there may be an assumption that veterinarians are already well conversant in these diseases.",

In our study, examination of summative scores for diseases revealed fairly good agreement between experts with and without a veterinary background, with some exceptions. In particular, experts with a veterinary background were more inclined to rank disease caused by C. psittaci in the top five zoonotic diseases of importance to GPs. This disease was recently identified as a cause of abortion storms in horses in Australia and was the putative cause of respiratory illness in veterinary staff which attended the animals [52].

While this study achieved an acceptable number of experts to ensure validity using this mode of survey [18,20,21], a larger number of respondents would have permitted a more robust statistical approach, especially when comparing responses between groups. Despite invitations being sent to even numbers of experts from veterinary and non-veterinary backgrounds, approximately 2/3 of responses were from experts with a veterinary background. This may be due to the fact that, historically, veterinarians have had more engagement with One Health [5,35], and may be more likely to see the benefits of a One Health approach. The lower response rate from experts with a non-veterinary background may mean that the responses may not be an accurate reflection of the opinions of this cohort. This does not appear to have biased the final results however as in the majority of areas there was reasonable agreement between experts of different backgrounds. Interestingly, a recent Australian Delphi survey [1] that focussed on One Health priorities for EID outbreak responses had a more even distribution of veterinary and non-veterinary participant groups. This may be because stakeholders with a non-veterinary background are more engaged with One Health concepts at a policy rather than clinical level. An improved level of response may have been achieved with a different study technique such as focus groups or interviews, or greater personal engagement at the invitation stage.",

Therefore, recommendations for what general medical and veterinary practitioners should be doing in practice may be limited by a lack of awareness of the realities of first opinion practice. Any future surveys and educational interventions directed at these target audiences should be thoroughly pilot tested to ensure relevance in this setting.",

This may have created some bias particularly in disease prioritization as some diseases, notably Hendra virus and B. suis, appear to have a limited geographic distribution in the north-east of Australia. It is unknown if recruitment of participants from other states and territories would have resulted in different priorities. We note however that these three states (NSW, Queensland and Victoria) account for 80% of the human population and thus findings reported here are likely to be representative of the perceived risks to the majority of Australians. Finally, we elected to restrict the study to two phases because there was a degree of consensus amongst experts and the study was deemed to have achieved its aims after only two phases. Further phases may have been able to explore the reasons behind the differences in opinion that emerged between experts with different backgrounds.",

This included general knowledge of zoonoses and emerging diseases, risk management and reporting practices, confidence/preparedness in diagnosing/managing zoonotic diseases, use of information sources, and cross-professional collaboration and referral. The expert panel found that future surveys of Australian clinicians should prioritise evaluation of GP and veterinarian knowledge of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of zoonoses, as well as risk management practices, including correct use of PPE and advice to clients/patients regarding zoonoses. In particular, the panel deemed that a good knowledge and understanding of Hendra virus, Q fever, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), anthrax and Brucella suis was most important for veterinarians, whilst for GPs Q fever, gastrointestinal/foodborne diseases, influenza, ABLV and local vector-borne diseases was most important.",
