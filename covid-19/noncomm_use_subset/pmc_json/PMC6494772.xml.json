It is easily neglected in the gingivitis stage or during early periodontitis because very few subjective symptoms are present. Thus, treatment usually begins after progression to a later stage, which is more difficult to cure due to the development of alveolar bone destruction [2]. As with most chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, constant maintenance and management are required.",

Furthermore, SPT helps to reduce tooth loss through periodic examinations of natural teeth and periodontal tissues, which help to identify other oral diseases or conditions that may require immediate treatment [34].",

In addition, in non-smokers, 5 years of SPT after periodontal surgery led to a decrease in the depth of the periodontal pocket and a significant increase in alveolar bone height [6]. Furthermore, only 4% of 572 patients with moderate periodontitis experienced tooth removal during a 4-year SPT period, with an annual mean alveolar bone height increase of 0.02 mm [7]. Therefore, SPT plays a critical role in preventing the development and deterioration of disease, and in maintaining healthy periodontal tissue, regardless of the severity of periodontitis or the applied treatment methods [8].",

In the final year of the study period, only 27.4% of the patients were fully compliant. In addition, significantly higher PC-SPT was observed after non-surgical treatment than after surgical treatment. PC decreased from 13.9% to 9% in the first 6 years of SPT. However, as dentists continued to inform patients of the importance of SPT and the patients continued to attend follow-up appointments, PC-SPT increased to 48.4% over the next 5 years. During the last 5 years of SPT, the average PC-SPT stabilized at 43.2%. This finding indicates that sustained improvements in PC-SPT are attainable in patients as long as its importance is regularly emphasized.",

This disease usually becomes evident in adults in their 30s or later due to its slow progressive nature, but it may also develop in adolescents with chronic dental plaque and calculus depositions due to lack of capability or awareness of the need for oral hygiene management [1]. SPT, which is performed after completion of periodontal treatment with the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis, has been reported to be an essential process for maintaining the outcome of periodontal treatment and ensuring the stability of treatment outcomes through additional evaluations [2324]. In other words, regular long-term visits and check-ups, with continuous education and guidance from dentists, are the most effective strategy for preventing the recurrence of chronic periodontitis and minimizing the loss of teeth and periodontal tissues [2324]. Therefore, for SPT to be effective, patients need to recognize the importance of maintaining periodontal health through continuous and regular visits to the dental clinic [25].",

One reason for this could be that fewer women than men are active in the workforce, and women are therefore likely to have more spare time. In this study, the ratio of male and female patients was evenly distributed (49.0% and 51.0%, respectively), and men accounted for 62.1% and 57.3% of the CCG and the ECG, respectively.

This finding is not in accordance with the results of previous studies, and this discrepancy may be because males engage in more social activities and interpersonal relationships than females, and are therefore more cognizant of the importance and necessity of dental treatment [2728]. In addition, in the 2007 study of Heft et al. [29], women experienced more fear and pain associated with dental treatments than men. Greater fear may also be cause lower PC-SPT.",

This may be due to the pain of tooth loss, the time required for dental treatment, and the financial burden involved. These patients therefore realize the importance of regular dental examinations, leading to a higher compliance rate. In this study, 32.5% of the patients had at least 1 implant, and 62.7% of the patients who had an implant were in the high PC-SPT groups. These results are also validated by previous studies [163132]. In addition, 55.4% of patients without any implants were in the ICG and the NCG. The observation that 82.4% of the patients in the NCG had no implants suggests a significant relationship between the presence of an implant and PC-SPT. Patients with implants usually undergo periodontal surgery and prosthodontics, and thus have more opportunities to visit different dental departments. This is related to higher PC-SPT.",

Regardless of PC-SPT, patients tend to prefer hospitals close to their homes. However, patient characteristics such as age and distance of the clinic from their residence showed tendencies that were not statistically significant. Many previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of age on PC [9111733]. Since most of the patients received only basic periodontitis treatment, it was not possible to conduct a meaningful analysis of PC-SPT according to the periodontal treatment method. Matthews et al. [34] reported that patients who underwent surgical periodontitis treatment had a higher rate of re-visits. However, in this study, nonsurgical periodontitis treatment accounted for more than 50% of the patients, and no statistical significance was found.",

In the NCG, 94.1% of the patients did not have newly decayed teeth. This result can be interpreted as indicating that these patients did not visit regularly during SPT, and thus newly decayed teeth were not found at all. This prediction can be made on the basis of the finding that newly decayed teeth were found at the highest rate (45.3%) in the ECG, which contained patients with a visit rate of more than 70% during SPT.",

This is an unexpected result. However, based on the finding that 75.0% of the patients in whom the alveolar bone level increased were in the high PC-SPT groups, it can be inferred that continuous and regular SPT after periodontal treatment improves patients' ability to manage their oral hygiene, leading to regeneration of periodontal tissue. Kocher et al. [7] also reported that the mean alveolar bone height increased by 0.02 mm annually after SPT. The periodontists who treated patients in the high PC-SPT groups who experienced decreased alveolar bone levels included relatively less skilled residents; thus, it can be assumed that an iatrogenic decrease in the clinical attachment level might occur during the course of periodontal treatment. Regarding the relatively low frequency of decreased alveolar bone levels in the low PC-SPT groups, the low compliance of these groups may be relevant; as such, re-evaluation at recall check-ups is essential.",

Relatively few of the patients who experienced maintenance of alveolar bone levels around implants were in the high PC-SPT groups (45.5%), whereas relatively many of those who experienced decreased alveolar bone levels were in those groups (71.8%). This means that the skills and experience of the periodontist should be confirmed in the high PC-SPT groups. Moreover, at the beginning of SPT, it is necessary to evaluate the overall condition of periodontal tissue, as well as the patient's oral hygiene management in daily life, dietary factors, smoking, and systemic disease [31]. Decreased alveolar bone levels around teeth and implants were most common in the ECG, which had a PC-SPT of over 70%; therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the abovementioned patient factors.",

In contrast, in this study, the NCG group had the greatest proportion of patients with 0 newly extracted teeth (94.1%), and the highest percentage of patients with newly extracted teeth was found in the ECG (46.6%). This can be interpreted in the same way as the number of newly decayed teeth. Patients in the NCG made very few visits, so it can be considered that teeth requiring extraction were not identified or treated. In addition, Tonetti et al. [39] and Cattabriga et al. [40] reported that tooth loss could occur due to other oral problems even if PC-SPT is excellent. This limitation highlights the fact that the cause of tooth loss cannot be deduced by simply evaluating PC. In fact, a patient who belonged to the ECG in this study underwent tooth extraction due to a tooth fracture, which bore no relationship to periodontitis.",
