The infection is prevalent worldwide (Elvander 1996, Paton and others 1998, Uttenthal and others 2000, Klem and others 2013), and BRSV is considered one of the major pathogens of the bovine respiratory disease complex (Griffin 1997, Snowder and others 2006, Brodersen 2010). To diagnose the infection, different strategies can be chosen according to the given situation and the purpose. For larger epidemiological studies, antibody analyses are used (H\u00e4gglund and others 2006, Beaudeau and others 2010, Ohlson and others 2010, Klem and others 2013). Infected animals seroconvert and IgG can be measured in serum and milk long after the virus is no longer present. Studies on the longevity of antibodies against BRSV are scarce, but Elvander (1996) found that such antibodies could be detected in the serum of adult cattle for at least two years postinfection.",

Antibodies in bulk tank milk (BTM), pooled milk samples from a selected number of cows or serum from several animals at a selected age have been used to classify a herd or given population (Paton and others 1998, Uttenthal and others 2000, Klem and others 2013, Ohlson and others 2013). Since animals are known to be seropositive for a long time, classification of herds based on serology in young animals (Klem and others 2013), or pooled milk samples from primiparous cows (Ohlson and others 2013), will give a more up-to-date picture than BTM testing. Recent studies show that testing of antibodies in BTM is a reliable tool for identification of BRSV-negative herds (Klem and others 2013, Ohlson and others 2013).",
