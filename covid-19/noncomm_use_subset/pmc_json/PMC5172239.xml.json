With parameters trained from the known genes (R, S, E, M, and N), Glimmer (Version 2) predicted nine ORFs that were named G1~G9. BGFV identified another nine genes that were named B1~B9. Besides the computational prediction, we manually identified five more ORFs (BGI-PUP-S-1~S-5) as candidates. Each of these candidates has an upstream region matching the pattern of TRS and its translated sequence is longer than 40 amino acids. All ORFs mentioned above were uniformly listed according to their initial sites along the genome sequence, and the predicted physiochemical properties of these ORFs were presented as well (Figure 1; Table 1).",

In this postulation, subgenome-length minus strands derives directly from the genome RNA during transcription, gets terminal TRS counterparts from the body sequence, and then fuses on the TRS region to accomplish the minus-strand after getting the counterpart of the leader. The completed minus-strand RNAs serve as templates for subgenomic mRNAs 9., 10..",

            "text": "Generally, it is found that coronavirus mRNAs are synthesized in amounts reversely related to their sizes, and the N protein is richer than any other proteins in infected cells. It suggests that the gradient of subgenomic mRNA amount results in that the large mRNA tends to premature and generates less proteins than the small subgenomic mRNAs (20). Site-directed mutations to TRSs along the genome decrease the transcriptional efficiencies or even eliminate the synthesis of the subgenomic RNAs. Mutations introduced in different places demonstrate that the upstream TRSs do not affect the downstream ones, but the latter affect the replication of the former. It provides a possible interpretation why the downstream proteins are richer in infected cells than the upstream ones (21). Although mutations in TRSs reduce their opportunities of transcription, some subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized with the mutated sites performed as markers, and the origin of the fused region (here refers TRS) can be traced. These results show that all the TRSs come from the body sequences rather than the leaders, and provide evidence for the minus-strand extending transcription model (22).",

(Mount Kisco, USA) through a web-based interface, has been specially modified and trained with parameters for virus (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=gfindv). Glimmer (Version 2), from TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research), is a program for gene identification with high performance in handling small genomes like bacteria and archaea 23., 24.. ZCURVE-CoV, developed by researchers in Tianjin University, is an approach to recognize ORFs with Z-Curve theory (25). BGFV is a program developed by Beijing Genomics Institute, based on the self-organizing theory (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102048). Fundamental principle of BGFV is the compositional discrepancy between coding and non-coding regions, which is relatively distinctive for simpler species. The prediction have been compared with previous annotations of other isolates for cross-checking. The length threshold for ORFs is the same as that applied by Marra et al. to Isolate Tor2 (5). One ORF is postulated to be a protein-coding region, if its translated sequence is longer than 40 amino acids. A unique segment, the leader-mRNA junction (26), should exist upstream to the transcription initiation site, within a distance of 100 nt, except for the R protein (to R, the distance is 131 nt).",
