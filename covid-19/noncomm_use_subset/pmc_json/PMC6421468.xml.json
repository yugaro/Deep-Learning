We confirmed this observation in A549 NSCLC cells treated with 50 \u03bcM AZA for 48 h by visualizing cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation with a monoclonal antibody against dsRNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). While there was no detectable dsRNA in untreated cells, accumulation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm was apparent after AZA treatment. To determine whether RNase L affects AZA sensitivity, we compared parental vector control A549 cells (wild type; WT) with RNase L knockout (KO) cells, previously generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology (33) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Cells treated with different amounts of AZA were monitored for survival as a function of time using an IncuCyte real-time cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience) and a dual-dye method. While the majority of WT cells appeared dead after 48 h of AZA treatment, the AZA-treated RNase L KO cells appeared normal (Fig. 1 A\u2013D). Quantification of WT cell survival showed that 63 and 77% of the cells had died by 60 h in response to 50 or 100 \u03bcM AZA, respectively (Fig. 1E). Cell death in WT cells was observed at concentrations of 6 \u03bcM AZA or greater. In contrast, the RNase L KO cells were highly resistant to 100 \u03bcM AZA after 60 h, with little or no death (Fig. 1F).",

The relative contributions of the different OAS isoforms to AZA-induced cell death were determined with double-knockout (DKO) HME cells, each expressing only one of the three enzymatically competent OAS isoforms. DKO cells lacking OAS2 and 3, OAS1 and 3, or OAS1 and 2 express only OAS1 (O1), 2 (O2), or 3 (O3), respectively (Fig. 2D). Survival of the different types of untreated cells was unaffected by OAS DKO or triple-knockout (TKO) genotypes (Fig. 2 E and H). Interestingly, expression of any of the three OAS isoforms rendered HME cells nearly as sensitive to AZA as the WT cells (Fig. 2F). However, compared with WT cells, the HME cells lacking all three OAS isoforms, namely TKO cells, were relatively resistant to AZA (Fig. 2 G and I), presumably because these cells are unable to synthesize 2-5A and are thus unable to activate RNase L. The observation that the OAS TKO cells are less resistant to AZA than RNase L KO cells suggests alternative functions of OAS isozymes that are not dependent on RNase L function (Fig. 2 C and I).",

Therefore, to determine whether IFN production, with subsequent OAS induction, is required for AZA-induced cell death, A549 cells in which MAVS was knocked out individually or in combination with RNase L were used (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). MAVS KO A549 cells were only slightly less sensitive to AZA treatment than WT cells, suggesting that, although IFN production may have contributed to AZA-mediated cell death, its effects were modest (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B and C). However, the RNase L-MAVS DKO cells were resistant to AZA at concentrations as high as 50 \u03bcM (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), similar to RNase L KO cells (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that basal levels of OAS1 to 3 in A549 cells, confirmed by gene expression analysis (SI Appendix, Table S1), are sufficient for the cell-lethal effect of AZA, through RNase L activation.",

Previously, ablation of either AKAP7 or PDE12 increased 2-5A levels by retarding its degradation (31, 37). Deletion of AKAP7 slightly increased cell-death rates in the presence of AZA, whereas PDE12 knockout had a much larger effect (Fig. 5B). The DKO for both AKAP7 and PDE12 greatly increased cell death in response to AZA (Fig. 5B).

Our prior study suggested that the accumulation of constitutively produced self dsRNA in ADAR1 KO cells leads to OAS-RNase L activation and cell death (28). Because the knockout of ADAR1 is lethal in A549 cells, it was necessary to use combination knockout cells for these experiments. To determine whether ADAR1 antagonizes the cell-lethal effect of AZA, A549 cells of different ADAR1, MAVS, and RNase L genotypes were treated with AZA. Western blots for these cell lines are shown in Fig. 5E and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 (in which IFN was used to induce levels of ADAR1 p150). ADAR1 p150, and to a lesser extent OAS1, was also induced by AZA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Cells with ADAR1-RNase L-MAVS TKO or ADAR1-RNase L DKO were resistant to AZA (Fig. 5F). In contrast, ADAR1-MAVS DKO cells showed increased AZA sensitivity compared with WT cells, presumably because of increased accumulation of self dsRNA due to the absence of ADAR1 (Fig. 5F). To further determine the relative contribution of ADAR1 isoforms, A549 cells lacking the IFN-inducible ADAR1 p150 isoform were compared with WT A549 cells (Fig. 5G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). ADAR1 p150 KO cells were more sensitive to AZA, suggesting that p150 is primarily involved in AZA-induced cytotoxicity. These results indicate that the AZA sensitivity of cells can be increased by ADAR1 deficiency.",

For example, DAC was shown to induce an IFN response in colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) through the MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 signaling pathway (14). Long-term growth of CICs was inhibited following transient treatment with a low dose of DAC.

The only well-established function of 2-5A is activation of RNase L, an antiviral protein with proapoptotic activity (21, 25, 26, 36). Here we observe that deletion of RNase L or OAS1 to 3 isoforms renders cells highly resistant to AZA-induced death. These results are in contrast to the consequences of viral infections of cells, in which OAS3 is the dominant OAS isoform, at least in some cell types (33). In addition to demethylating DNA, AZA treatment leads to RNA demethylation (44), which increases RNA immune signaling through TLR3 (45). However, the dependence on the dsRNA-activated OAS-RNase L pathway for AZA-induced cell death suggests that it is DNA demethylation leading to dsRNA, and not RNA demethylation, that is responsible for the cytotoxic response. RNase L causes apoptosis through a ribotoxic stress pathway involving JNK-dependent signaling (29). Consistent with the involvement of RNase L in AZA-induced cell death is the observation that a small-molecule inhibitor of JNK suppresses apoptosis in response to AZA.",

Also, during DNA damage induced by IR or chemotherapeutic agents, U1 and U2 small noncoding RNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm, activating the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and IFN-dependent signaling (32). In support of this idea, we show here that IR increases the cytotoxicity of AZA through RNase L. Very interestingly, many different primary malignant tumors, including those of the head and neck, lung, prostate, breast, and high-grade gliomas, express high levels of OAS expression as part of the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature (41). Therefore, AZA-induced cell death through OAS-RNase L is likely to preferentially target these cancer cells in vivo.",

When ADAR1 is mutated, the deficiency in self dsRNA editing is believed to lead to increased activation of OAS-RNase L, whereas during AZA treatment it is likely that increased transcription of repetitive DNA elements causes OAS-RNase L activation. Since ADAR1 deletion is lethal in A549 cells, we used ADAR1-MAVS DKO A549 cells in our experiments (28). Because both ADAR1 knockout and AZA treatment result in the synthesis of self dsRNA, the combination of ADAR1 deficiency with AZA treatment was especially cytotoxic.",

To determine whether the same pathway is required for AZA-induced cell death, MAVS KO cells were studied. MAVS deletion reduced but did not prevent cell death by OAS-RNase L in response to AZA treatment, a result similar to our findings in ADAR1 KO cells (28). Therefore, basal levels of OAS isozymes are sufficient to mediate cell death through RNase L activation (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1). Prior studies on mouse hepatitis virus showed that, in mouse bone marrow macrophages, basal levels of OAS are sufficient for RNase L activation (33, 50). Taken together, these results reveal that IFN does not need to be induced for an antiviral or cell-death response through OAS-RNase L, provided that sufficient basal levels of OAS and RNase L are present. Furthermore, the correlation of basal OAS1 and OASL levels with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 tumor cell panel indicates that OAS1 (or OASL) can be a biomarker for AZA sensitivity in cancer.",

DNMTi treatment of mouse cells with mutant p53 led to massive dsRNA accumulation, originating at least in part from the transcription of repetitive DNA elements, culminating in a cell-suicidal type I IFN response (42). The transcribed repetitive DNA elements included SINEs, satellite repeats, endogenous IAP retroviral DNA, and noncoding RNA genes (42). However, A549 and HME cells are p53-wild type (52, 53), yet both are AZA-sensitive.

Therefore, treatments that increase RNase L activity directly or indirectly, for instance by inhibiting PDE12 (30, 37) and/or AKAP7 (31), are predicted to increase the antitumor activities of AZA or DAC.
