Nonetheless, the threat of communicable diseases persists; emerging infectious diseases continue to be identified, often in association with changes in human and animal mobility, agricultural practices, environmental degradation, and misuse of antimicrobial therapy (Jones et al., 2008; Keesing et al., 2010; Kuehn, 2010). Recent outbreaks or epidemics associated with MERS coronavirus (Azhar et al., 2014), influenza A (H7N9) (Cowling et al., 2013), and the West African emergence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (Baize et al., 2014), have challenged epidemiologists as the natural history, modes of transmission, and/or means of control of these diseases have not been well understood during initial periods of emergence.",

            "text": "When novel infectious diseases emerge or familiar diseases resurge, mathematical models can serve as useful tools for the synthesis of available data, management of uncertainty, and projection of likely epidemic trajectories (Fisman, 2009). While it may be challenging to parameterize detailed mechanistic mathematical models when there is little information on mechanisms of transmission, baseline immunity in a community, or the nature of the infecting pathogen, a number of descriptive approaches exist which may permit fitting, and forecasting, of an epidemic curve. One single equation approach that has been applied to emerging infections is the Richards model, which treats cumulative infections as a logistic growth process (Hsieh & Chen, 2009; Wang, Wu, & Yang, 2012). However, the concept of modeling an epidemic curve as a simple function, without reference to mechanisms of transmission, is in fact much older, and may originate in the work of the English polymath Dr. William Farr (1807\u20131883), who rose from humble beginnings to become a physician, mathematician, hygienist and protege of Lancet founder Dr. Thomas Wakley (Brownlee, 1915a; Fine, 1979; Greenwood, 1933). Dr. Farr spent almost 40 years at the General Register Office of the United Kingdom, and the esteem in which he was held is apparent in the \u201cletters\u201d he published annually as appendices to the reports of the Registrar General, in which he supplemented the dry statistical reports with thoughtful and creative musings on topics as wide-ranging as the relationships between occupation and disease, suicide and mortality in the mentally ill, population density and mortality, and as above the \u201claws\u201d governing epidemics (Farr, 1840).",

            "text": "William Farr's analysis is a classic in the epidemiology literature. Farr examined the course of mortality attributable to smallpox between mid 1837 (when death registration was introduced into England and Wales) and 1839, and noted that the numbers peaked in the spring quarter of 1838 and then declined until summer 1839 (Fig. 1) (Farr, 1840). He noted that the pattern of decline was very close to what would be predicted if the ratios of cases in successive quarters declined at a constant rate. He provided numbers demonstrating this in his annual report to the Registrar General in 1840 (Fig. 1), but did not develop the idea at length. Looking back on this, we may note that this approach is analogous to assuming that the number of transmissions per case (or the \u201creproduction number\u201d in modern terminology), were to decline at a constant rate during the course of an epidemic. The key difference is that Farr worked before the germ theory, and analysed data in terms of successive calendar time periods rather than successive generations of cases. There is a further irony to the story, in that he never returned to this idea until 1866, at which time there was a major epidemic of rinderpest, which some feared would destroy the British cattle population (Brownlee, 1915a). Farr applied a similar analysis, but this time based upon assuming that the third ratio of cases per month was a constant (in effect assuming that the reproduction number declined at a constantly accelerating pace). He used this approach to predict that the epidemic would decline rapidly over the subsequent six months, and published this, including predicted monthly incidence numbers, in the Daily News of London in February 1866. His predictions were close to what subsequently happened (Brownlee, 1915a).",

This two-parameter model, which we have referred to as the \u201cIncidence Decay with Exponential Adjustment\u201d (IDEA) model, offers advantages of simplicity, explicit linkage to theory of epidemic growth, and also acknowledges the fact that epidemics and outbreaks do not peak and end simply due to depletion of susceptibles, but because of a complex constellation of public health actions and behavioral changes that may modify the course of an epidemic and reduce the effective reproduction number Re(t) during an outbreak (Fisman et al., 2013). In our previously published description of this model, we validated model projections by showing that they were identical to those derived from a discrete-time susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model, provided the SIR model had a low basic reproduction number (R0) and exponential improvement in control over the course of the epidemic (Fisman et al., 2013).",

Here we demonstrate the equivalence of these methods for epidemic modeling and forecasting, explore the potential advantages of using these methods to complement other approaches, and identify the circumstances under which these methods closely approximate the commonly-used SIR modeling approach. We explore numerical examples derived from recent emerging infectious diseases, including 2014\u20132015 West African Ebola virus outbreak.

We have subsequently realized, and demonstrate above, that our approach simply represented a restatement of Farr's work, albeit in a manner that is tied to the concept of R0. According to Brownlee, Farr promised to describe the derivation of his model in greater detail in future reports, but never did so (Brownlee, 1915a), and much of the mathematical elaboration of Farr's work was in fact done by Brownlee after Farr's death (Brownlee, 1915c). Nonetheless, Brownlee notes that to Farr, the predictive accuracy of his approach reflected three characteristics of epidemics, according to Farr's (pre-microbial) understanding: (i) diminution in the number of susceptibles over time due to recovery from infection (\u201cimmunity\u201d, though to use this term in application to Farr is an anachronism); (ii) diminished population density due to death from infection; and (iii) diminishing pathogenicity of the disease with each passing generation of infection as a result of (to quote Farr) \u201c[loss of] part of the force of infection in every body through which they pass\u2026the matter\u2026diminishes in strength at every transmission by innoculation\u201d (Brownlee, 1915a). The first two characteristics are not incompatible with the current understanding of epidemic dynamics, whereas the third is not (though it does anticipate more modern ideas around evolution of virulence and disease ecology (Ewald, 2004; Lipsitch & Moxon, 1997)).",

Referring to first principles, the components of a reproduction number are duration of infectiousness, contact rate, and probability of transmission conditional on contact, as well as susceptibility in a population (Vynnycky & White, 2010). We presume that public health interventions, population behavior change (as a result of education or rumours, prudence or fear), and the occurrence of silent infections with immunity could all contribute to deceleration of epidemic spread, even when the effective reproduction number is expected to be greater than 1 due to widespread susceptibility in the population. Furthermore, we note that Farr's original \u201ctime step\u201d appears to have been arbitrary (reflecting the form of data available to him: weekly for rinderpest, quarterly for smallpox), whereas we have used generations as time steps in our more recent applications of Farr's \u201claw\u201d, and in IDEA and SIR models. This potential discrepancy between Farr's initial efforts and our more recent efforts can be addressed by a simple rescaling of the time parameter, and is thus immaterial to our conclusions.",

Our contribution in the current work is to show that Farr's law, while derived in the pre-microbial era, can be reformulated in terms of the concept of the basic reproduction number, combined with exponential increase in control via an unspecified mechanism. We observe, unexpectedly, that Farr's K can be expressed as a function of the IDEA d parameter alone, independent of R0, implying that epidemic trajectory is (and has historically been) more a function of control efforts and changing behavior than of the fundamental characteristics of a given infectious disease. Whether or not the ratio K can have stand-alone value as a tool to identify unexpected shifts in epidemic trajectory (e.g., the two wave epidemic of Chikungunya referred to in Fig. 7 above) will be the subject of future work.",
