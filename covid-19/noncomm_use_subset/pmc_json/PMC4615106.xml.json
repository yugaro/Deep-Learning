This is a central point of attack by many antibiotics, which capitalize on small but distinct differences between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes.5,6 Reading frame is determined by recognition of a start codon by an initiator tRNA in the ribosome's decoding center and is maintained through the consistent translocation by 3 nucleotides during elongation. The three stop codons do not correspond to any tRNAs, this enables the release factor complex to initiate translation termination. Translational recoding comprises the spectrum of events which occur when canonical translation is disrupted. This ranges from mechanisms which subvert initiation,7 alter the equilibria of events during elongation,8 and affect the termination process9 generally resulting in suppression or reinitiation. This document mainly focuses on a particular recoding event called programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting that occurs during elongation.",

In particular, \u22121 PRF was chosen because there are sufficient viral examples to enable the generation of heuristics. This is in contrast to +1 frameshifting, which appears to be idiosyncratic. The basic strategy is to perform a pattern-match based search for allowable heptameric slippery sequences followed by strong downstream structure; this search is NP-complete27 and therefore computationally difficult. The initial study using this approach pressed the available CPU limits at the time, taking significant time for relatively small numbers of sequences.28 Later searches against the yeast genome refined this strategy and used significantly greater computational resources, allowing the yeast genome to be exhaustively searched in months.29 Further refinements, increases in memory/CPU, and larger computational resources made it possible to complete approximately one genome per week30 along with comparisons against randomized sequences. Analysis of multiple genomes reveals that approximately 10% of annotated genes contain at least one high-confidence potential frameshift signal.

As shown in Figure 3, as telomeres age, they progressively shorten, and at some point reach an intermediate, uncapped status. This recruits a complex containing the MRX complex (Mre11p, Rad50p, Xrs2p) plus Tel1p, which in turn recruits the CST complex (Cdc13p, Stn1p and Ten1), inducing checkpoint arrest at the G2/M boundary. Phosphorylation of Cdc13p by Tel1p enables recruitment of telomerase through Est1p, stimulating telomere repair, and releasing cells from checkpoint arrest. Failure to recruit telomerase leads to further telomere shortening, where they eventually resemble double-stranded breaks (DSB). These short telomeres recruit the DSB repair machinery, resulting in strong checkpoint arrest at the G2/M boundary. Eventually, these short telomeres are maintained by this machinery, resulting in telomere end joining, and bypass of checkpoint arrest, i.e. multiply budded cells. The net effect is to \u201cimmortalize\u201d telomeres, resulting in longer lifespans, but at the cost of genome integrity. As shown in Figure 3, we propose that \u22121 PRF is used to maintain the correct stoichiometric ratios of telomerase components critical for telomerase recruitment. Changes in the expression of any one of these components, e.g. by abrogating \u22121 PRF in EST2 or overexpressing any single component, has dominant-negative effects on telomerase recruitment resulting in the observed increased rates of telomere shortening, consistent with the intermediate telomere lengths observed in these mutants. We further propose that changing the expression of all of the \u22121 PRF containing mRNAs, e.g., by globally changing rates of \u22121 PRF or by inactivation of NMD, has an even more dramatic effect, accounting for the very short telomeres observed in these classes of mutants.\n\n",

            "text": "If \u22121 PRF is normally employed to control gene expression, it stands to reason that \u22121 PRF itself should be subject to regulation. As suggested above, since global changes in \u22121 PRF tend to be detrimental to cells, regulation of \u22121 PRF should be sequence-specific. Given that \u22121 PRF is directed by cis-acting elements in mRNAs, sequence-specific interactions could be mediated by either base-pairing interactions with trans-acting RNAs, or by highly specific interactions with trans-acting proteins. Indeed, examples of both cases have been recently documented. The human CCR5 mRNA harbors a \u22121 PRF signal that functions as an mRNA destabilizing element by directing elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons, and we recently demonstrated that sequence specific interactions between this element and at least 2 micro-RNAs (miRNAs) promote increased rates of -1 PRF.33 Mapping of the miRNA/\u22121 PRF signal interaction suggested that formation of an RNA-triplex structure stabilizes the frameshift-stimulating mRNA pseudoknot, leading to increased ribosome pause times at the slippery sequence, further enhancing frameshifting. With this in mind, it is also possible that trans-acting RNAs that destabilize \u22121 PRF stimulating pseudoknots may also exist, i.e., these would have \u22121 PRF inhibitory activity. Trans-acting proteins can also stimulate \u22121 PRF: in the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), both \u22121 and \u22122 PRF are stimulated by the virus-encoded nsp1\u03b2 replicase subunit that specifically interacts with sequence containing the slippery site.45",

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that such linkages may be forthcoming. The DKC1 gene encodes dyskerin, the protein that catalyzes conversion of uridines into pseudouridine in ribosomal rRNAs. Patients harboring mutations in this gene present with X-linked dyskeratosis (X-DC), a congenital disease characterized by bone marrow failure, dystrophic nails, mucosal leukoplakia, mottled rashes, congenital anomoalies and additional clinical presentations.46 Hypo-pseudouridulated yeast and human ribosomes have lower affinities for tRNAs, resulting in greater rates of tRNA slippage at \u22121 PRF signals.47 In unpublished work, we have shown that these mutant yeast cells have shortened telomeres, consistent with the progeria like symptoms of this disease. Indeed, X-DC is a member of a general class of diseases called ribosomopathies, which are caused by mutations in ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in ribosome biogenesis.48 Unpublished yeast based studies in our laboratory suggest that translational fidelity defects including altered rates of \u22121 PRF, may play important roles in this general class of diseases. Spinocerebellar ataxia 26 (SCA26) is caused by a mutation in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), the GTPase that translocates ribosomes along mRNAs.49\n\u22121 PRF can occur during translocation, and inhibition of this process can stimulate this.50\n\u22121 PRF is elevated In yeast cells expressing mutant forms of eEF2 harboring the SCA26-equivalent mutation,49 and in unpublished work, we have observed that this also occurs in cells derived from SCA26 patients. The finding that the same mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (eL16) found in a significant fraction of patients with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) also promotes increased rates of \u22121 PRF (by promoting decreased ribosomal affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA) provides evidence that somatically acquired mutations that affect \u22121 PRF may contribute to at least some cancers.51",

Surprisingly, unlike viruses, where \u22121 PRF is used to expand the genomic coding content, it appears that \u22121 PRF signals are used to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by functioning as mRNA destabilizing elements. Emerging evidence links global defects in \u22121 PRF to a growing number of human diseases. Recent studies in yeast revealed the importance of this mechanism in telomere maintenance and cell-cycle control, and current research suggests that may also be applicable to human cells. The recent finding of \u22121 PRF signal-specific regulation by miRNAs has solved one of the central questions in the field, and in combination with the telomerase studies, provokes the hypothesis that aging may be programmed in part by \u22121 PRF. The ability of trans-acting factors to manipulate \u22121 PRF also suggests therapeutic approaches including recombinant proteins, and synthetic non-coding RNAs/RNA analogs. Other more global approaches may include use of small molecule modulators of \u22121 PRF, or targeting of downstream pathways, e.g. nonsense mediated mRNA decay. The new paradigms described here will continue to guide a diverse set of research efforts into the future.",

(B) Model: a \u22121 PRF event directs a ribosome to a premature termination codon.

            "text": "Figure 3.: Model: telomerase recruitment to uncapped telomeres is controlled by the relative stoichiometries of telomerase components in yeast. Top left depicts a fully capped telomere. As telomeres shorten, they become uncapped (middle left), recruiting the MRX-Tel1p complex, which in turn recruits the CST complex to the telomere end. Phosphorylation of Cdc13p by Tel1p recruits telomerase via Est1p. Est2p is the reverse transcriptase component of telomerase. If telomeres continue to shorten, they resemble chromosomes with double stranded breaks (DSB-like, lower left), recruiting DNA repair machinery. This results in cell growth arrest at checkpoint (G2/M). If cells cannot repair the defect, they undergo \u201ccrisis\u201d and a subpopulation will bypass arrest, maintaining their chromosome ends by DSB repair. Operational \u22121 PRF signals have been identified in the STN1, CDC13, EST1 and EST2 mRNAs. We propose that their relative abundances are controlled by \u22121 PRF. In optimal conditions, precisely controlled rates of \u22121 PRF ensures that these proteins are present in the correct stoichiometries, maximizing telomere repair (bold up arrow), and minimizing progression to the DSB-like state. When expression of any one of these genes is altered, e.g. telomerase recruitment is less efficient and more telomeres progress more rapidly to the DSB-like state. When expression of all 4 are altered, e.g., by global changes in \u22121 PRF or by abrogation of NMD, telomeres progress rapidly to the DSB-like state.",
