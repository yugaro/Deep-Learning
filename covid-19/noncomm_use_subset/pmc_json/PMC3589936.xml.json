            "text": "Exposure to ionizing irradiation may result in tissue damage, and have negative impacts on our health and safety. Nuclear accidents can lead to serious social economic issues [1]. The toxicity of ionizing irradiation, described as acute radiation syndrome (ARS) or radiation sickness is caused by total- or partial-body exposure to a high dose of penetrating ionizing radiation over a short period of time. Even at low doses, ionizing irradiation is capable of causing illness, and ARS can occur within hours to days [2]. In clinical medicine, ARS often exists as the adverse side-effect of radiation therapy for cancer and other diseases. Administration of medicine for radiation damage control is one of the most effective and direct approaches to protect and treat the injuries caused by ionizing radiation. Thousands of compounds have been reported to offer potential for radiation protection, but most of them are not suitable for clinical application. There is only a small window of opportunity for administration of chemical drugs, which may be introduced prior to or immediately after irradiation exposure. Biological drugs have poor specificity. Most radio-protective agents have severe toxicity [3, 4]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective compounds that offer radiation protection.",

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important family of immune receptors. To date, at least 13 human TLRs have been identified and extensively investigated in the immune system of invertebrates. TLRs are important cell surface receptors in the innate immune system and play a vital role in the natural immune system at the initiation stage of multiple immune signaling pathways. It has been reported that TLRs can induce antigen-presenting cell maturation and secretion of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, resulting in a connection between innate immunity and acquired immunity. TLRs can induce strong antigen-specific immune responses [6, 7].",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) belongs to the TLR family and plays a pivotal role in the natural immune system. TLR5 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells, mononuclear cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It mediates immune response and inflammation formation, and activates downstream NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. To our knowledge, the only natural agonist available is a bacterial flagellum protein, flagellin [8, 9]. Flagellin is present as a soluble protein in certain bacteria, such as Salmonella, and can be recognized by the natural immune system of fruit flies, plants and mammals. Based on the structure of flagellin, Burdelya and colleagues [10] have successfully produced CBLB502 peptide by using genetic engineering technique. CBLB502 peptide offers protection against radiation injury both in vitroand in vivo, and can inhibit the process of normal cell apoptosis [10]. Therefore, it can prevent normal tissues from receiving radiation damage while maintaining the sensitivity of tumors to radiation. This function mainly occurs through the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [11]. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a compound that is derived mainly from industrial sewage. It has linear, branching and extra-branching types. The application of PEI in biological medicine has attracted considerable attention, since PEI can be used as a carrier in gene therapy [12, 13], and has shown anti-fungal effect in in vitroexperiments [14]. Recently, it has been reported that PEI has a high-density ionic charge that can selectively activate the intracellular TLR5 receptor, promoting generation and secretion of downstream TLR5 signaling pathway factors, such as keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) in mice [13]. However, there have been no reports published investigating the protective effects of PEI against radiation injury.We hypothesize that the high-density ionic charge of PEI activates the hTLR5 receptor-mediated NF-\u03baB pathway, and provides an anti-radiation effect. This paper aimed to investigate whether polyethylenimine could activate the hTLR5 mediated NF-\u03baB pathway and if so, whether polyethylenimine provides an anti-radiation effect as a TLR5 targeted agonist in a mouse model.",

NF-\u03baB is an important nuclear transcriptional regulation factor, which participates in the transcription regulation of diverse genes, and actively contributes to immune response and cell cycle activity. Investigation of the NF-\u03baB pathway has unveiled its involvement in certain medical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, immune dysfunctions, tumors and radiation-induced injury [17\u201320]. Establishment of an effective cell-based model for screening agonists of the human TLR5-mediated NF-\u03baB pathway will help to identify compounds with greater specific action on the pathway, without side-effects on other signaling networks, to achieve pharmacological effects. For this purpose, we cloned the human TLR5 gene and created pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB-hTLR5 plasmid for use in the present study. Our human TLR5 cell model is more suitable for screening the human type TLR5-mediated NF-kB activity aiming for human therapeutic application than the early commercial murine TLR5 plasmid model used in previous studies [13].",

We have also observed TLR5 receptor activated by a linear PEI in vitroin a separate study.

This finding is in agreement with a previous study using linear PEI that activated murine TLR5-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [13]. The current study provides evidence that branched PEI offers radiation protection in addition to a previous report that a combination of linear PEI and siRNA produces immunostimulation in ovarian carcinoma mice [13]. The mechanism and effect of PEI are very similar to flagellin protein. It is interesting to note that the PEI used in our experiments is a chemical compound with a molecular weight of \u223c25 kDa, and the molecular weight of flagellin protein ranges from 30 kDa to 60 kDa. Therefore, PEI may offer the following advantages over flagellin protein: (1) higher pharmacological specificity than flagellin protein [22, 23]; (2) requires a lower dose than flagellin protein to achieve the same effect [11]; (3) easier to be delivered to its targets [24, 25]; and (4) stable in storage at room temperature [26, 27].",

In addition, PEI improves animal quality of life, prolongs animal survival time and reduces mortality. The 50% and 36% mortality rates in low- and high-dose PEI groups, respectively, are most likely due to insufficient radiation protection provided by the dose of PEI administrated. The dose might have been too low to provide complete radiation protection. If higher mortality resulted from high doses of PEI, the mortality observed in the high-dose (10 mg/kg) group should have been greater than that of the low-dose (5 mg/kg) group, but the pattern observed was in fact the opposite.",

After the hTLR5 gene was obtained from CaCo-2 cells, sub-cloning strategy was applied to clone the hTLR5 into pcDNA3.1-V5/His B vector. Following digestion and expression verification by western blot (WB), the recombinant plasmid was transfected into cells, and hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling was assayed by treatment of flagellin. (A) Flow diagram for construction of the recombinant plasmid of hTLR5. (B) hTLR5 construct sub-cloning and identification with restriction enzyme digestion. (C) hTLR5 protein expression identified by WB. (D) Cell-based screening model that activates hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling.

Forty-one mice were randomly divided into four groups, and injected with saline (n= 10), AMI (150 mg/kg, n= 10), PEI (5 mg/kg, n= 10) and PEI (10 mg/kg, n= 11), respectively. Animals were injected with different agents 30 min before an 8-Gy 60Co \u03b3-ray total body irradiation (TBI). (A) PEI significantly increased the survival rate of the radiated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with IR mock, animal survival time and survival rate were significantly improved in mice that received a low dose of PEI (P= 0.019), or high dose of PEI (P< 0.001). (B) Body weight of surviving irradiated animals that received a low dose of PEI, high dose of PEI or AMI, was increased with time over a period of 30 days (r= 0.42, P< 0.02; 0.72, P< 0.0001; 0.95, P< 0.0001, respectively). Animal body weight in IR mock declined with time (r= \u20130.89; P< 0.0001).",
