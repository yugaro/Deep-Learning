In contrast, Millichap and Wainwright [5] reported that only 1% of the RSV-positive patients were admitted to the PICU with neurologic complications. In a study comparing the common viruses responsible for febrile seizure, Chung and Wong [14] revealed that the incidence of febrile seizure for RSV was 5.3%, and among them, complex febrile seizure was observed in 13.6% of cases, which was lower than the percentage of such cases for influenza and adenovirus.",

In addition, most of the previous studies were regarding encephalopathy or relatively severe patients, and did not focus on overall features of RSV-associated seizures. It has not yet been fully determined whether the clinical characteristics of the RSV-associated febrile seizure are similar to those of the general febrile seizure, and whether RSV-associated afebrile seizures are benign situation-related seizures, as reported by Miyama and Goto [6]. Based on this background, we aimed to investigate the RSV-associated neurologic manifestations in children who presented with seizures. Furthermore, we report a transient DWI change in a young child with acute encephalopathy symptoms exhibiting seizures.",

The patients whose neurological symptoms were caused by factors other than RSV infections, and those with epilepsy were excluded. In this study, a simple febrile seizure was defined as a seizure occurring during a febrile illness and not caused by an acute disease of the nervous system in children aged between 6 months and 5 years [18]. The seizure should be generalized and short (duration less than 15 minutes) and not recur within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizure was defined as a 1) focal, 2) generalized, and prolonged seizure lasting more than 15 minutes and recurring with 24 hours, or 3) postictal neurological abnormalities, such as Todd's palsy [18]. This study was performed in a regional hospital in Guri, a city located in the metropolitan area around Seoul. All research protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Hanyang University Guri Hospital (approval number: 2017-12-014). Informed consent was exempted by the IRB.",

Abnormal EEG signals were observed in 2 patients (both with complex febrile seizure): epileptiform discharges from the frontal (n=1) and fronto-central (n=1) areas. Brain MRI abnormalities were observed in 2 patients (both with complex febrile seizure): decreased perfusion in the left frontal lobe (n=1) and benign lipoma (n=1). Abnormal CSF pressure was observed in 3 of the patients: simple febrile seizure (n=1) and complex febrile seizure (n=2). Details of the clinical profiles of febrile seizure are described in Table 2. All the patients with febrile seizure recovered without complication.",

The HSI on DWI rapidly disappeared by the fourth hospital day, suggesting that the mechanism of encephalopathy was transient cytotoxic edema (Fig. 2).

Most of the febrile seizures are generalized, with approximately one-third of the patients exhibiting complex febrile seizure and febrile status epilepticus occurring in 5% of the cases [24]. However, the RSVrelated febrile seizure have not been well-characterized. The well-known study of Sweetman et al. [7] reported the incidence of neurological complication associated with RSV to be 1.2% (12 of 964 patients). The authors included 1 patient with complex febrile seizure but excluded five patients with simple febrile seizure. In the present study, the incidence of RSV-associated seizures, including febrile seizure, was 2.9%, which is higher than the finding of Sweetman et al. [7] The global features of febrile seizure observed in this study were similar to those of the generally known febrile seizure, such as age and benign nature. However, the incidence of complex febrile seizure was higher than that of simple febrile seizure. Most of the patients showed multiple seizures in a day, which may be a distinguishing characteristic of RSV-associated febrile seizure. The reason of higher incidence of complex febrile seizure in RSV-associated febrile seizure is unclear. Previous studies reported the increased levels of CSF proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 in patients with encephalopathy who had RSV infection. Although febrile seizure is not as severe as encephalopathy is, RSV-specific cytokine responses may be related with multiple or prolonged RSV-associated febrile seizures [11,25,26]. As RSV is one of the common infections in young children, there should be further studies of the characteristics of febrile seizure in RSV infection.",

            "text": "There are various RSV-associated neuroradiological findings. In most cases, brain MRI reveals no changes. However, the findings of brain edema on computed tomography and focal HSI on MRI (fluid attenuation inversion recovery and DWI) in CSF RSV-positive patients with seizures in another study suggest a pathogenic heterogeneity [11]. Furthermore, DWI abnormalities in the globus pallidus in the patient suggest ischemic changes [5]. In the study by Park et al. [16], the abnormal MRI findings for RSV-related encephalitis were rhombenmesencephalitis, limbic encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and diffusion abnormality on DWI was not found. In our encephalopathy case, the patient showed transient HSI on DWI on the first day of acute symptoms; this rapidly disappeared over 3 days. Our case suggests that cytotoxic edema is one of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RSV-associated encephalopathy. Moreover, DWI can detect the early changes in encephalitis, and appropriate timing of MRI is important to reveal the dynamic changes [27]. In the very acute stage, restricted diffusion can be detected; in the subacute stage, diffusion restriction diminishes and the ADC value increases [27]. A good outcome is usually related with the absence of cytotoxic edema, because it implies cellular edema, which may result in cellular death [27]. However, the outcome of our patient was favorable; hence, cytotoxic edema of white matter in RSV-associated encephalopathy may not always be associated with poor outcome. Transient white matter cytotoxic edema is rare, and has been previously reported in a child with traumatic brain injury, whose DWI and ADC revealed restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum and peri-atrial white matter [28,29]. The abundant N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors in the corpus callosum may lead to intracellular calcium entry [28]. Increased Ca2+ activates enzymes such as ATPase, phospholipase, protease, and endonucleases can lead to the cell injury and death [30].",
