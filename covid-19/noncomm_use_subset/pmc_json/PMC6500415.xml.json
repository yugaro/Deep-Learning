As part of SAS Operation Bulbasket in Nazi-occupied France, Dane organized the building of advanced landing strips; Dane\u2019s main French strip was named Bon Bon. On 7th August 1944 Wing Commander Alan Boxer and Flight Lieutenant Abbott flew two Lockheed Hudsons into Bon Bon to evacuate Allied survivors of Bulbasket: thirty-five out of fifty-five, 64 percent, had been lost9. Dane had to wait at Bon Bon for four more days until a USAAF C-47 (DC3) arrived, piloted by Colonel Clifford Heflin who picked up Dane, five USAAF pilots shot down by German forces, and two British signalmen9. Colonel Heflin later became commander of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit Special Airfield for the Manhattan Project and was awarded the Legion of Merit by Eisenhower, and the French Cross of War and Legion of Honor11.",

In the spring of 1955, Dane returned from the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide18,19,30 to Clare and Cambridge, from which in 1955 he received an M.B., and I received a B.A. Also in 1955 David Surrey Dane married Veronica Tester Hope, a widow, with two children Kerin and Alex. This family of four moved forthwith to Belfast, where the Danes later had three additional children: Roland, Penelope and Thomas18,19. That same year, 1955, Dane joined Professor George Dick\u2019s Department at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, where in the winter of 1956 they developed plans for a Virus Reference Laboratory which became operational within the year18,19,30,31. Dane also started a research programme \u201cwhich aimed at identifying human hepatitis viruses by electron microscopy\u201d32. In 1969, \u201csome doubted whether Australian antigen was specifically related to hepatitis B virus\u201d2. In a letter invited by Eugene Garfield to Current Contents in 1980, Dane wrote that he \u201cthought that [by the 1960s] EM and negative staining techniques had developed to the stage where they could be used by virologists\u201d32. Dane and his Belfast coworkers used specimens negatively stained with \u201c4% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6.5 and applied to formvar/carbon grids before examination in an A.E.I. EM 801 electron microscope\u201d3. Hepatitis B virus was found by Dane to be a particle 42 nm in diameter with DNA and DNA polymerase3,32, later eponymously named the \u201cDane particle\u201d32. Dane wrote that \u201cI never discovered whether the person who originally referred to it this way was a well-wisher who thought we were right or someone who hoped we were wrong\u201d32.",
