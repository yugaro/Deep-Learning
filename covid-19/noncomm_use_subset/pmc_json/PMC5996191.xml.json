At any given time, about 1 in 25 inpatients has an HAI. This leads to the loss of tens of thousands of lives and costs the US health care system billions of dollars annually [2]. The primary transmission route of pathogens between patients in HAIs is via health care workers (HCWs)\u2019 hands [3]. Thus, hand hygiene (HH) is the single most important factor for preventing HAIs [1].",

Consistently with previous studies [13,21,22,25], our participants\u2019 self-reported HH performance rate of self was positively correlated with their scores for perceptions, attitudes, and role models. An explanation for this is that general perceptions of HH [13,21,22] and the perception of being a role model for one\u2019s colleagues [13,25] are very important for improving HH compliance among HCWs [13]. As such, these findings could be used in future HH promotion strategies for nurses.",
