They are staffed by specialists in travel and tropical medicine and are typically secondary or tertiary points of care for patients, although immediate referral from the emergency departments attached to the respective parent hospitals is common. All of the centres provide post-travel services, which are billed under the provincial health plans. Collected data include each patient's demographic characteristics, detailed recent travel itinerary, all countries visited within the past 5 years, reason for travel, affected organ system, and whether the patient had a pretravel encounter with a health care provider. Final diagnoses are made by the attending physicians at each CanTravNet site, and each diagnosis is assigned a diagnostic code selected from a standardized list of more than 500 diagnostic entities, some of which are etiologic (e.g., Campylobacter) and others of which are syndromic (e.g., acute diarrhea). Syndromic codes are entered when an etiologic code cannot be assigned because of use of empiric therapy, self-limited disease, or inability to justify complete or sophisticated work-up as part of routine clinical practice. All CanTravNet sites contribute microbiologically confirmed data, where available, based on the best reference diagnostic tests (including serologic assays and polymerase chain reaction) available in Canada at the time. \"Probable\" diagnoses are restricted to patients with pathognomonic physical findings (e.g., tick eschar), clinical response to highly specific therapy, or classical presentation and exposure history with laboratory exclusion of other possible etiologies.",

Travel to visit friends and relatives is defined as travel by an immigrant who is ethnically and/or racially distinct from the majority population in his or her current country of residence and who is returning to his or her homeland to visit friends and relatives. This type of travel also refers to travel by children of foreign-born parents (i.e., second-generation immigrants) who return to their parents' homeland to visit friends and relatives. The term \"visiting friends and relatives\" is typically applied to individuals travelling from a high-income country of current residence to a low-income country of origin.12 \"Medical tourists\" are defined as those whose primary purpose of travel is to seek emergency or elective care and who, as a consequence of the travel, acquire an infectious complication secondary to the medical care received or become ill with an infectious or noninfectious disease while abroad.",

Ill returned travellers with malaria were proportionately more likely to require inpatient management than those with other diagnoses. Of the 94 cases of malaria in ill returned travellers, 60% were caused by P. falciparum, which can lead to severe and fatal disease. Moreover, 8.5% of travellers with malaria had complicated or cerebral malaria, which underscores the potential severity of this highly preventable illness among travellers, as outlined in the Canadian recommendations for the management of falciparum malaria in Canada.15 Of the 174 cases of imported severe or cerebral malaria reported in Canada by the Canadian Malaria Network between 2001 and 2012, 95% were due to P. falciparum (unpublished data [A.E.M.]). In addition, cases of severe or cerebral malaria have increased over time, from 11 in 2001 to 26 in 2012 (unpublished data [A.E.M.]). It should be noted that pretravel advice is not routinely covered by provincial health plans, nor are many travel medications such as malaria prophylaxis.

First, the population analyzed represents only those ill returned travellers who presented to a CanTravNet clinic; as such, our conclusions may not extend to all ill returned travellers. However, the top countries of exposure for non-immigrant travellers paralleled the top countries visited by travelling Canadians in general, with Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and China included among the top 10 destinations for both this cohort and the general Canadian population (International travel survey: Canadian residents 2000\u20132010 [custom extract supplied by Statistics Canada]). The top 3 source countries for new immigrants to Canada (the Philippines, China, and India)37 were also represented among the top 4 countries of emigration for immigrant travellers in this cohort. Second, travellers with mild or self-limited illnesses or illnesses with very short or very long incubation periods may have sought care in different settings. For example, our study did not capture illnesses for which care was sought during travel. Similarly, ill travellers returning from destinations perceived to be low risk may be underrepresented in the CanTravNet database. Third, data on inpatient versus outpatient management may be influenced by regional variations in management guidelines. Fourth, our data do not permit estimation of incidence rates or destination- specific numeric risks for particular diseases.10,38 Finally, intersite variation in screening protocols for new immigrants and refugees may have led to over- or under-contributions of particular diagnoses from individual sites. Nearly half of all cases (48%) were contributed by Montreal sites, which may have introduced bias because of interprovince variation in travel patterns.",

At an individual level, it can lead to reduced work and school productivity, home convalescence, hospital admission, and potentially death, along with costs related to diagnostic tests and other medical visits that occur during the evaluation of such illnesses. At a population level, the potential for travellers to import public health threats, such as measles, sexually transmitted infections, and blood-borne and vector-borne diseases, is substantial. Accurate knowledge of the health problems faced by international travellers in different geographic destinations provides a robust evidence base for physicians to deliver effective preventive advice, immunizations, and prophylactic medications to travellers. This profile further informs post-travel diagnosis and therapy, as well as prioritization of pretravel intervention strategies for the most significant illnesses. The evidence presented here contributes to program-level decisions of the Public Health Agency of Canada related to provision of travel health information and prevention and control of infectious diseases. Specifically, it can inform decisions about allocation of resources to address certain at-risk populations such as those travelling to visit friends and relatives and travellers to specific destinations. It also contributes to the Agency's situational awareness and response to emerging and ongoing outbreaks and enhances the recommendation statements of the Agency's expert advisory committee, CATMAT. In this way, the Canada-specific surveillance data reported here should inform public health policy and strategic initiatives related to defining, monitoring, and preventing travelacquired illness in Canadians.",
