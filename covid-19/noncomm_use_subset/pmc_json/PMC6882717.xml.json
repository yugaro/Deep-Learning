There are several constraints that hinder the development process in poultry sector; among them, disease is the major one. Various pathogens, such as bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, etc., are responsible for causing diseases in poultry and they attack their different body systems [3]. Respiratory tract, an important part of poultry body system, frequently affected by pathogens causing respiratory diseases [4]. Several pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and environmental factors initiate the respiratory diseases of chicken. Viral and bacterial pathogens are responsible for causing most of the respiratory diseases, namely, avian rhinotracheitis (ART), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), etc., that lead to huge economic losses in poultry industry [5]. Bacterial pathogens colonize the respiratory system after primarily introducing of viral or environmental stress for pathogens [6].",

            "text": "ART virus is also known as avian pneumovirus (APV), important respiratory viral disease affecting both chickens and turkeys [7]. ART was first identified in Bangladesh at 2016 by Ali et al. [8] in broiler breeder, layer, and Sonali chicken (cross-breed between Rhode Island Red cocks and Fayoumi hens). Sneezing, depression, coughing tracheal rales, swollen infraorbital sinus, ocular and nasal discharges, and foamy conjunctivitis are the major signs associated with the disease [9]. This virus also causes swollen-head syndrome in broiler breeders and broiler [10] and dropped egg production in layers [11]. ORT, another important bacterial pathogen, belonging to the super family of RNA containing bacteria causes respiratory infections and affects air sac [12]. It has been reported throughout the world except Bangladesh and mainly affect in turkey and chickens but other species can often be infected with this pathogen [13]. This can act as primary or secondary agents depending on immune status, environmental factors, and pathogenicity of related strain and also the presence of other pathogens [14]. ILT virus, an important virus, causes respiratory infection in birds belonging to the family Herpesviridae. Thus, virus mainly affects the chickens and characterizes by sneezing, nasal discharge, swollen infraorbital, and nasal sinuses and sometime affects eye leads to conjunctivitis [15]. The disease more frequently occurs in the areas of intensive poultry production and outbreak causes\u2019 high economic loss as it increases mortality, reduces egg production, and declines growth rates [16]. Another important viral pathogens responsible for respiratory disease, namely, Avian IBV belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family [17]. It can affect chickens of all ages, and primarily it replicates in respiratory tract, and later, it can move to epithelial cells gut, oviduct, and kidney, results decreased egg production and growth performance and sometimes attract other pathogens [18]. So far, it has been reported in chickens, turkey, pigeon, pheasant, Guinea fowl, and peafowl [17].",

Serum samples were diluted at 1:50 dilution in dilution buffer, followed by 1:10 dilution, and final dilution of 1:500 was used as working samples for respective ELISA. 100 \u03bcl of negative and positive controls was added into antibody coated plate wells A1, B1 and C1, D1, respectively, remaining 92 wells were filled with samples.

Meanwhile, conjugate and wash solutions were prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After incubation, contents of wells were aspirated and washed four times with wash buffer (350 \u03bcl). Then, the plate was inverted and tapped firmly on absorbent paper to remove the moisture. Then, 100 \u03bcl conjugate reagents were added on each well. Again, the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in case of IBV and 60 min in case of ART, ORT, and ILT, respectively. After incubation, washed the plate with wash buffer following the procedure described previously.

Compared to broiler, the seropositive was found more in sonali chicken. Interestingly, no samples were found positive against ART virus in case of broiler but 12% were recorded in sonali birds. The past seroprevalence study of ART in Bangladesh found overall 53.29% chickens including 35.57% sonali and 50.85% layer chickens [8]. On the contrary, Sharma et al. [24] found the higher number of ART positive sample 31.7% in broiler flocks in Grenada, West Indies. A higher rate of seropositivity in the later study was observed as this area had the highest density of broiler flocks. Detection of ART antibodies, which is also known as APV, in broiler was negative compared to sonali birds (0% vs. 12%), this higher positive results in sonali to broiler might be due to the life span, that longer life span may allow the sonali birds to develop stronger immunity against the virus detected [24]. In Egypt, similar study was carried out by Nagy et al. [10] reported 21.7% ART seropositive broiler samples. Another reason of lower seropositive in this study may be due to the fact that infected chicken may not necessarily produce humoral antibodies or antibodies may be at very low levels at the time of the sampling [25].",

            "text": "From the above findings, it may be concluded that the percentage of ORT and IBV in broiler and sonali birds is higher than remaining two pathogens (ART and ILT). In Bangladesh, infectious bronchitis causes a great deal of economic losses through poor weight gain and production drop. High seropositive was found for ORT that indicates ubiquitous presence of the organism in study areas. As there is no vaccination practiced for ORT, it indicates that a larger portion of poultry flock is experiencing new field infection. Further investigation could be done to know the molecular characteristics and surveillance of the four respiratory diseases.",
