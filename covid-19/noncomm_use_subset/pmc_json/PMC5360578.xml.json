These viruses can be associated with a range of clinical severity from asymptomatic to mild, self-limited illness to respiratory failure and death.

Even highly sensitive pathogen-specific tests such as PCR are dependent upon proper sampling technique and inclusion of virus-type-specific reagents and processing methods. Moreover, detection of a specific microbe in a clinical sample does not necessarily indicate the cause of the acute clinical syndrome. For example, it has been reported that HRV has been detected in up to 44% of asymptomatic individuals (Byington et al., 2015, Johnston et al., 1993). Therefore, better tools that help providers define the etiology of a suspected infectious syndrome in a safe, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective manner are of paramount importance for both individual and public health as recently noted by the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (House, 2014), and others (O'Neill, 2015, Organization, 2015). A complementary diagnostic strategy to pathogen detection could focus on utilizing the varied (but pathogen-class specific) host-response to infection (Ramilo and Mejias, 2009, Zaas et al., 2014). This approach discriminates between infection and colonization. It is pathogen-agnostic and therefore circumvents another limitation of pathogen detection assays, which due to technical limitations are only capable of detecting a limited subset of microorganisms. Furthermore, categorizing infection based on host response provides additional insights into the mechanisms of infection and disease response, and may offer new targets, pathways, or strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

Moreover, this ARV signature was validated in an independent population of patients with influenza A infection, demonstrating an ability to distinguish from bacterial respiratory infections (93% accuracy) and healthy controls (100% accuracy) (Zaas et al., 2009). Thus, host derived biomarkers are capable of making these types of distinction. However, considering the technical challenges inherent in developing peripheral blood host gene expression classifiers as a diagnostic tool \u2013 including semi-invasive venipuncture, RNA instability, processing complexity, relatively high cost of RNA profiling, and time to result \u2013 we sought to extend this host response paradigm for ARV diagnosis to an alternative and potentially more suitable sample matrix and analyte class.",

Based on the prominent role of the nasopharyngeal epithelium in mediating ARV infections, we hypothesized that nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL) would reflect the in situ host response and serve as a potential target for diagnostic development. Furthermore, the NPL protein fraction represents an accessible sample matrix, providing a highly tractable diagnostic analyte class. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) platform for facile development of multiplexed, quantitative assays for measuring specific protein levels in biologic fluids and is routinely used for biomarker verification in clinical cohorts (Kiyonami et al., 2011, Gerszten et al., 2010, Boja and Rodriguez, 2011). In addition to being customizable for nearly any target protein, MRM assays provide a more specific quantitation of individual proteins and protein isoforms by targeting multiple unique peptides per protein target. Combined with internal stable-isotope labeled (SIL) peptide standards, these assays match or exceed the quantitative precision of ELISA assays with low femtomole limits of quantitation and analytical precision coefficient of variation < 10% across clinically sized cohorts (Addona et al., 2009, Aebersold et al., 2013).",

The objective of these experimental challenge studies was to generate clinico-molecular classifiers of ARV infection through the development and characterization of high-density sample and data sets across the course of respiratory virus exposure, infection, and resolution. A description of methods used in each challenge study can be found in Supplementary materials and have been described previously (Liu et al., 2016, McClain et al., 2016, Woods et al., 2013, Zaas et al., 2009). Briefly, healthy volunteers underwent extensive pre-enrollment health screening and were excluded for positive baseline antibody titers of the strain of virus used in each challenge (Influenza A H3N2 A/Wisconsin/67/2005 or HRV serotype 39). Following 24\u201348 h in quarantine, we instilled viral inoculum into bilateral nares of subjects using standard methods. At predetermined intervals, biological samples and clinical and symptom data were collected. NPL sampling was performed daily for each participant. The H3N2 #2 cohort included an early (36 h post-inoculation) oseltamivir treatment arm, while HRV #2 included a blinded \u201csham\u201d inoculation (saline only) control group. NPL analyses included baseline and time T samples from all individuals in each challenge study with complete and unambiguous symptomatology and microbiology data, and available NPL samples. Sample phenotype labels were blinded for MRM analysis, but were assayed in a manner to ensure that samples from an individual, and from within a challenge study, would be processed in same batch and assayed in close temporal proximity, to minimize batch effects between distinct phenotypes.",

For quantitative processing, peptide quantities across all ten 2D-LC fractions were summed and the dataset was intensity-scaled to the robust mean (excluding highest and lowest 10% of detected features) across all quantitative acquisitions.

First, we sought a minimum two-fold change in expression between baseline and time T in the infected pool in at least 2 peptides per protein; this criterion was used to classify proteins that would increase or decrease as a function of infection within the same individuals over time. Levels of 107 proteins increased at least two-fold, while 61 proteins decreased at least two-fold from baseline to time T. The second criterion was a greater than two-fold difference between infected and time-matched uninfected subjects; this criteria was to enable specificity of the proteins by comparing test and control subjects at a time where symptoms are present. This included 36 proteins with higher expression and 33 proteins with lower expression. The third criterion excluded proteins that might reflect general nasal trauma stemming from repeated collections. To address this, we calculated the expression change between the time of maximal symptoms for infected subjects (Inf-T) relative to similar times for uninfected subjects (Uninf-T), and prioritized candidates with unique response to infection at time T. Additionally, four proteins met 2 of 3 criteria and also had a reported association with infection (IC1) (Zaas et al., 2009) and inflammation (APOA1, APOA2, and APOA4) (Pirillo et al., 2015) and were included in the verification phase.

This was expected, since the pooled sample is the biological average of all samples included in the pool. For example, retinoic acid receptor responder protein TIG1 was measured across three unique peptides in the pooled discovery data set, with an average fold change from uninfected to infected time T of 3.3-fold. Targeted MRM assays developed for two TIG1 peptides demonstrated average increased expression of 2.3- and 2.0-fold when assayed in individual NPL samples (Table 2). Similarly, two complement factor B (CFAB) peptides displayed 2.0- and 2.0-fold increased expression when assayed in individual H3N2 #1 samples by MRM, compared to a 3.6-fold increase for the summed 24-peptide CFAB protein composite assayed in the pooled H3N2 #1 discovery dataset. Also as expected, the pooled discovery dataset shows much more narrow standard deviation (Fig. 2A), as this deviation is due only to technical variability, whereas the variability in the targeted MRM experiment of all individuals (Fig. 2B) is able to discern the actual biological variation. These combined results provided confidence that the pooled-sample 2D-LC-MS/MS phase 1 discovery strategy gives a good measure of the average protein expression level in situations where the matrix of interest is extremely sample-limited, and that the phase 2 targeted MRM assays reproduce protein expression changes candidates selected using the pooled data, while also providing biological variance with higher sensitivity.",

In a combined analysis across the four independent ARV cohorts, we found that median sample-wise peptide expression intensity was relatively constant across all samples regardless of infection status, though 26 of 47 peptide analytes measured to be differentially expressed (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) at the time of maximal symptoms in the infected H3N2 subjects. Likewise, 30 peptide analytes were differentially expressed (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) in the HRV subjects at time T, with 16 peptides overlapping between the two H3N2 and two HRV cohorts. The direction and magnitude of change for all 40 peptide analytes (10 H3N2 only, 14 HRV only, 16 in both) that were significantly differentially expressed in either the H3N2 or HRV cohorts are highly correlated (r = 0.871) between viral groups (Fig. 3), indicating that these analytes are likely not virus type-specific or useful in differentiating between H3N2 and HRV.

Fig. 4A shows the performance of a NPL classification model that selected 10 peptides (9 unique proteins), in the four independent challenge cohorts, including discordant individuals adjudicated using GEA status as a tiebreaker. For this analysis we ignored the paired nature of samples in the training and classification tasks in order to better estimate the accuracies in a situation in which baseline samples are not available. Overall classifier performance (Fig. 4B) in LOOCV yielded an AUROC of 0.8623 (95% CI: 0.7538\u20130.9315, bootstrapped 10 K samples) with a 75% TPR and 97.46% TNR. Baseline samples from the asymptomatic cohort were withheld from model training since this was not a phenotype the model was trying to identify. However, they represent a cohort of asymptomatic individuals available for validation. Applying the model to these 37 samples revealed only one misclassification error (2.7%).

Analysis of differentially expressed NPL proteins in infected individuals demonstrates involvement in several biological pathways critical to mounting a host defense to virus infection, including innate immune responses, acute inflammatory responses, and defense response pathways. The inclusion of three members of the complement system (CFAB, A1AT, and IC1) is particularly consistent with an innate immune response, as the complement system enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from the infected site (Ricklin et al., 2010). Despite the apparently related pathways involved, there does not appear to be extensive overlap between the differentially expressed nasal proteins identified in our H3N2 #1 challenge study, and the previous peripheral blood RNA signatures of ARV infection characterized in the same challenge cohort (Zaas et al., 2009). One gene product that is increased at both the NPL peptide and peripheral blood RNA level upon influenza infection (Cameron et al., 2008, Cameron et al., 2007, Zaas et al., 2009) is IC1 (SERPING1 gene). IC1 (also called C1-inhibitor) is a peptidase inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily and has an important role in innate immunity through modulation of the classical pathway of complement activation (Gaboriaud et al., 2004). As the complement system has the potential to be damaging to host tissues, complement control proteins must tightly regulate activation. IC1 binds to complement protein C1 to inhibit activation of the classical complement pathway, and thus its discovery fits well with our understanding of the biology of these diseases.",

Oshansky and colleagues assayed nasal lavage samples from a cohort of healthy and naturally-infected influenza patients using a multiplex cytokine and chemokine assay panel, reporting correlation of inflammatory cytokines MCP-3 and IFN-\u03b12 with disease progression (Oshansky et al., 2014). An aptamer-based detection method was subsequently used to screen the same cohort and generate quantitative measures of over 1000 protein analytes from nasal lavage, showing differential expression of 162 proteins including cytokines associated with immune response to infection (Marion et al., 2016). We did not identify inflammatory cytokines to be differentially expressed in our pooled NPL analysis. It is possible that cytokine proteins in NPL samples are expressed at levels below the detection limits of LC/MS-based methods, and that coupling targeted methods capable of detecting and quantifying cytokines directly may provide enhanced datasets for biomarker discovery.",

The clinical definition of symptomatic, even when applying standardized symptom scoring and algorithms, includes elements of subjectivity and thus may be imperfect in describing such infections.

However, experimental challenges do not perfectly replicate natural ARV infection and illness in humans. Volunteers in these studies are young and healthy, and represent a relatively homogenous population. In contrast, patients presenting to clinical care are demographically heterogeneous, have a variety of comorbidities, present at various times in the course of their illness, and contain a far greater breadth of potential pathogens beyond the two studied here. As such, additional validation should be performed in a more diverse population, such as patients presenting to clinical care with community-onset disease. While the generalizability of this study's findings will require additional validation, the high TNR of 97.46% suggests this assay may provide value in ruling out ARV infection.",

The results presented in this study provide evidence that a protein-based host response to ARV infection can be detected in the nasopharyngeal space, and that this response involves perturbation of pathways involved in acute inflammation and innate immune response. Further, this work demonstrates that targeted assays measuring peptides involved in this response allow classification of ARV infection with a high degree of accuracy. Validation of these findings across independent experimentally infected Influenza A and human rhinovirus cohorts suggests a robust and generalized response to viral infection. With further development as a clinical diagnostic, this signature may have utility in rapid screening for emerging infections, avoidance of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and more rapid implementation of appropriate therapeutic and public health strategies. Nonetheless, as with other validated biomarkers, additional validation in community-based cohorts will be important to demonstrate the potential utility of such an assay in its clinical applications. Furthermore, testing this approach across a larger series of upper respiratory viruses will be important to understand its full potential utility and limitations. An assay that combines host protein biomarkers with nasal viral antigen detection may be quite valuable in clinical care to optimize therapeutic decision making. And whilst a positive result from such an assay may avoid the use of inappropriate microbial therapy, it will likely require vigilance on the part of the clinician to exclude bacterial co-infection when clinically indicated.",

The availability of a proteomic \u2018signature\u2019 that accurately classifies ARV infection and might be migrated to simple and inexpensive antibody-based tests that are routinely used in both clinical laboratory and over-the-counter diagnostic applications represents an important advance, and may one day yield a ARV host response test that is safe, simple, rapid, inexpensive, and accurate.",
