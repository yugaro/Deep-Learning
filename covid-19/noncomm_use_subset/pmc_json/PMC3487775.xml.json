            "text": "Cholera toxin (CT) produced by Vibrio cholerae, the major factor responsible for the severe watery diarrhea characteristic of the disease cholera, acts by intoxicating the intestinal epithelial cells (1). CT is an AB5 toxin with a single enzymatic A subunit (CTA) and five identical B polypeptides that form a pentameric B subunit (CTB). The toxin must first bind to host cells to begin a complex process whereby it gains access to its target protein in the cytoplasm. The B subunit has five identical sites that can bind to ganglioside GM1 (GM1) receptors in the plasma membrane (PM). The receptor-toxin complex formed at the PM is endocytosed and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2, 3). Retrograde transport of CT to the ER is not mediated efficiently by other gangliosides and nonceramide lipids. The A subunit is not required for this trafficking pathway (4). The carboxy-terminal (A2) domain of the A subunit interacts noncovalently with the B pentamer to stabilize the heterohexameric AB5 structure of the holotoxin. The A subunit has a disulfide-linked loop between Cys-187 and Cys-199, and the enzymatically active A1 fragment (CT-A1) is generated during synthesis of CT by V. cholerae protease(s) or subsequently in the gut or during interaction with the target cell (by host proteases) by cleavage after Arg-192. Once CT is in the ER, the disulfide bond in CTA is reduced, and in a PDI-dependent process, CT-A1 dissociates from the rest of the toxin (5, 6). CT-A1 then retrotranslocates to the cytoplasm by a process that is dependent on the ER-associated degradation pathway (7\u20139). CT-A1 may masquerade as a misfolded protein, since it is inherently unstable at physiological temperatures and stabilizing it can prevent it from exiting the ER (10). In the cytosol, CT-A1 escapes degradation by the proteasome due to the paucity of lysine residues in its structure. It then forms an allosterically activated complex by binding to an ADP ribosylation factor (ARF), and it ADP ribosylates the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, leading to constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase. In the human intestinal cell line T84, an increased concentration of cyclic AMP elicits a Cl\u2013 secretory response which can be measured electrophysiologically in real time as a change in short circuit current, Isc (11).",

            "text": "A key step in the intoxication process is the transport of the toxin from the cell surface to the ER. How GM1 confers the specificity for lipid trafficking has not yet been determined. Pentameric binding of GM1 by the B subunit of CT may itself induce membrane curvature and induce invagination to begin the entry process, as is seen with simian virus 40 (SV40) (12) and Shiga toxin (13\u201315). Interestingly, invasion by SV40 occurs only with GM1 that has native long-chain acyl groups. Clustering of GM1 may enable the toxin to associate with lipid rafts that serve as platforms for trafficking of CT through the retrograde pathway or parts of it. Lipid rafts are viewed as highly dynamic microdomains that may self-assemble in membranes from sphingomyelin, cholesterol, glycolipids, and proteins that favor a lipid-ordered microenvironment (reviewed in references 16 to 18). Some functions attributed to lipid rafts may require interactions with protein components or scaffolds to stabilize them, extend their lifetimes, or facilitate their coalescence into larger physiologically significant structures. By binding to and cross-linking five GM1 molecules, CTB might serve as such a protein scaffold and promote the function of lipid rafts in toxin trafficking. Conversion of PM sphingomyelin to ceramide or acute depletion of membrane cholesterol both prevent endocytosis of CT (19, 20), consistent with a role for lipid rafts in CT trafficking. A requirement for the lipid raft-associated proteins flotillin 1 and flotillin 2 in a zebra fish model of intoxication by cholera toxin (21) also supports the key role of lipid rafts in trafficking of CT.",

            "text": "Our previous study (22) showed that a mixture of CT holotoxins produced in vivo and having chimeric B pentamers with from zero to two wild-type (wt) GM1 binding sites (BS) was still capable of intoxicating host cells. Because genetic methods, not chemical modifications, were used to prepare these toxin variants, the structures of their GM1 BS were fully defined and were known to be either the same as wt sites or inactive. Thus, having at most 2 wt GM1 BS was sufficient for CT to intoxicate host cells, albeit at reduced efficiency. Left unanswered, however, was the question of whether a holotoxin with only one binding site for the GM1 receptor can function. A toxin molecule able to bind only a single GM1 molecule would be completely unable to cluster GM1 molecules or scaffold them into microdomains and would therefore be unable to induce membrane curvature (2, 23). We designed the experiments reported here to produce defined holotoxin variants that have from zero to five native GM1 BS in their B pentamers, and we compared their abilities to bind to GM1 and intoxicate T84 cells. We found that holotoxins able to interact with only a single GM1 molecule can nevertheless still complete the intoxication process, demonstrating directly that binding a single GM1 molecule permits the toxin to enter the host cell, complete the trafficking process, and deliver the toxic CT-A1 fragment to the cytoplasm. However, we also found that eliminating even a single binding site from wt holotoxin produced a detectable attenuation in toxicity.",

            "text": "To produce CT holotoxins with defined combinations of wt and mutant CTB subunits, we made three compatible plasmid constructs encoding either tagged wt CTB, CTB-G33D, or wt CTA and expressed them in the same Escherichia coli strain to produce a holotoxin pool with B pentamers consisting of tagged wt CTB and/or CTB-G33D, from which to purify all six possible holotoxin variants. The tag is a 34-amino-acid peptide (denoted GSH6) which is genetically appended after the Met103 codon of native ctxB and encodes glycosylation (bold) and sulfation sites (underlined) (24), SSSGGGGSSHPNNTSNNTSSAEDYEYPS, followed by six His residues. Each plasmid has a different replication origin, antibiotic selection, and combination of promoters (Fig. 1A; Table 1). The ctxA gene, encoding CTA, is expressed from dual pLac and pBAD promoters. Holotoxins and free B pentamers were purified from whole-cell lysates by metal-ion affinity chromatography on Talon resin, and free B pentamers were removed by passing the eluate pool over cation exchange resin, resulting in binding of the free CTB pentamers to the resin and recovery of holotoxin in the flowthrough (Fig. 1B). Holotoxins with different numbers of BS were then separated by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1C). By varying the amount of each inducer, we sought to alter the ratio of wt and mutant B subunits in the holotoxin pool. However, for practical purposes, we found that a single condition of relatively low levels of arabinose (0.0005% to express GSH6-tagged wt-CTB) and high levels of isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (400 \u00b5M to express native-size CTB-G33D) gave acceptable yields of holotoxin with homopentameric and singly or doubly tagged heteropentameric B subunits (with zero, one, and two wt BS, respectively) and detectable but lower yields of the triple, quadruple, and homopentameric tagged B subunits as described in detail in the next paragraph. This production strain we designated AMBT (for A, mutant CTB, wt CTB-tagged). Simply by swapping the wt and G33D alleles in the respective CTB-encoding vectors and keeping the same inducer ratios, we were able to express the single or double tagged heteropentameric and homopentameric wt CTB subunits with three, four, and five wt BS, respectively, from the production strain designated ABMT (A, wt CTB, mutant CTB-tagged). Using these strategies, from two production strains, we produced all six variant holotoxins, which had from zero to five wt BS and a maximum of two tagged subunits. A third production strain, designated ABBT (A, wt CTB, wt CTB-tagged), in which both the GSH6-tagged and untagged B polypeptides were wt CTB, was used under the same expression conditions to produce control holotoxins with five native BS and zero, one, or two tagged CTB subunits.",

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the purification process for the AMBT strain (mutant CTB-G33D, wt CTB tagged). Since CTB pentamers naturally bind to metal affinity resins (25), cholera toxin variants can be purified to near-homogeneity by a single passage over Talon resin. The imidazole eluate pool from the Talon resin contained a mixture of holotoxin and some free CTB pentamers. These free pentamers were removed by cation exchange chromatography, where at pH 8.0 in 50 mM Tris buffer, holotoxin passed through the column while free pentamers bound and could be eluted subsequently with a salt gradient (Fig. 1B). The heterogenous mixture of holotoxins was further separated into its components by anion-exchange chromatography. The GSH6 tag not only changed the size of the B monomer but also changed its predicted pI from 8.24 for native CTB to 6.21 for CTB-GSH6. The respective predicted pIs for the CTB-G33D variant changed from 7.31 for the native length to 5.91 for the GSH6-tagged variant. All holotoxins bound to the anion exchange matrix, and at least five peaks could be discerned following elution with a salt gradient (Fig. 1C). Samples from individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE either without (Fig. 1D, upper) or after (Fig. 1D, lower) boiling in sample loading buffer. The unboiled samples in lanes 4 to 13 showed a single band corresponding to assembled holotoxin (AB5), with a small amount of contaminating protein of slower mobility in lanes 2 and 3. The major fractions from each peak are homogenous and are consistent with each peak containing a single species of variant holotoxin, The assembled holotoxins in the unboiled samples bind less SDS than if they were fully denatured and therefore do not migrate in direct proportion to their molecular weights. The relative molecular weight (Mr) for each holotoxin variant is increased by the presence of one or more tagged CTB subunits. Each of these holotoxins completely disassembles into its component polypeptides after boiling (Fig. 1D, lower panel; CTA, 29 kDa; CTB-GSH6-tagged monomer, 14.4 kDa; and native CTB-G33D monomer, 11.5 kDa). The holotoxin in peak 0 (Fig. 1C) has homopentameric CTB-G33D subunits and no functional GM1 BS, while holotoxins in peaks 1 and 2 have a mixture of wt CTB-GSH6 and CTB-G33D pentamers with 1 and 2 GM1 BS, respectively. The fractions loaded in lanes 2 to 5 contain CTA plus 5 CTB-G33D (peak 0), and those in lanes 6 to 9 contain CTA plus 1 wt CTB-GSH6 and 4 CTB-G33D (peak 1), and those in lanes 10 to 13 contain CTA plus 2 wt CTB-GSH6 and 3 CTB-G33D (peak 2). Only these first three peaks were well enough separated to be purified efficiently from the extract of production strain AMBT. The fractions corresponding to each peak were pooled, dialyzed, and rerun over the same anion-exchange column to achieve a very high degree of purity. To make holotoxins with 3 and 4 native GM1 BS, an expression and purification run was done using strain ABMT, which produced three peaks similar to those shown in Fig. 1C, containing holotoxins with zero, one, or two GSH6-tagged CTB-G33D subunits and five, four, or three native GM1 BS, respectively.

The upper panel shows a gel run with unboiled samples, and the lower panel shows a gel run with samples boiled in sample buffer to dissociate the components. Without boiling, holotoxins with untagged or tagged wt CTB pentamers (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 2 to 4) dissociated into free CTA and stable pentameric B subunits that ran near the 45-kDa marker (lane 1). Interestingly, the presence of one or more CTB-G33D polypeptides increased stability of the heterohexameric AB5 holotoxins. Consequently, unboiled holotoxins with three or more CTB-G33D polypeptides (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 5 to 7) remained fully associated and ran near the 66-kDa marker (lane 1), whereas unboiled holotoxins with one or two CTB-G33D subunits exhibited partial dissociation into B pentamer and free CTA (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 8 and 9). The high stability of the heterohexameric AB5 holotoxins containing five, four, or three CTB-G33D polypeptides is also evident in the upper panel of Fig. 1D. As expected, increasing the number of tagged CTB polypeptides resulted in moderate decreases in observed mobilities of the pentamer bands (Fig. 2, upper panel, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4) and the holotoxin bands (Fig. 2, upper panel, compare lanes 5, 6, and 7), and increasing the number of CTB-G33D polypeptides resulted in slight increases in mobilities of the holotoxin bands (Fig. 2, upper panel, compare lanes 6 to 8 and lanes 7 to 9). Upon boiling, all holotoxins dissociated and resolved into their individual polypeptide components (Fig. 2, lower panel). All holotoxins have one CTA subunit. Holotoxins in lanes 2 and 5 are predicted to have five native CTB monomers; holotoxins in lanes 3, 6, and 8 have are predicted to have one tagged CTB and 4 untagged CTB monomers; and holotoxins in lanes 4, 7, and 9 are predicted to have two tagged and three untagged CTB monomers.",

The observed fractional densities were then compared with the expected values based on the predicted molecular mass of each polypeptide (CTA, 27.2 kDa; wt CTB, 11.6 kDa; and tagged CTB, 15.3 kDa) and the assumption that binding of Coomassie blue is proportional to the mass of each peptide. The results (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) were generally within 15% of expected values, but all observed values for tagged B subunits were higher than expected, suggesting that the tagged subunits bound proportionately more Coomassie blue stain than native CTA or CTB. Corrected for loading differences, the expected stoichiometric ratios for the tagged B subunit bands in lanes 3 versus 4, 6 versus 7, and 8 versus 9 were 1:2, and the corresponding observed ratios were 1:2.1, 1:1.7, and 1:1.9, respectively.",

Figure 3 shows that at high GM1 density, toxins with more than one native GM1 BS bound almost as well as native cholera toxin. The single-BS holotoxin showed a lower plateau signal at high GM1 density than holotoxins with more than one BS, which we interpret to be due to a less favorable equilibrium between binding and release for the holotoxin with one BS for GM1. With more than one BS, a toxin molecule is expected to exhibit faster initial binding to immobilized GM1, multivalent binding as the density of immobilized GM1 increases, and slower dissociation from GM1, resulting in increased avidity of binding. In wells coated with 75 nM GM1 (50 \u00b5l, 3.75 pmol), toxins with 2 or more native GM1 BS bound at more than 90% of the wt level, toxin with a single BS bound significantly less at 60% of the wt level, and toxin with no BS gave a minimal signal (4% or less of the wt level). At lower GM1 densities, there were significant differences between all variants, and in wells coated with 1.2 nM GM1 (50 \u00b5l, 60 fmol), toxins with four or three BS bound at 54 and 49% of wt levels, respectively, and toxins with 2, 1, or no BS bound at 25, 12, and 1% of wt levels, respectively. The amount of GM1 required to coat each well and give 50% of the maximal signal was calculated to be 65, 100, 150, 240, and 850 fmol per well for wt holotoxin and for holotoxin variants with 4, 3, 2, or 1 wt BS, respectively.",

In this assay, approximately 2 ng of unnicked native cholera toxin caused rounding of 75 to 100% of the cells (48 U/100 ng). The G33D holotoxin showed some rounding at only the highest concentration tested (33 ng, extrapolating to less than 1 U/100 ng). All holotoxin variants with one or more BS showed rounding of Y1 cells at between 24 and 48 U/100 ng, showing that a single GM1 binding site is sufficient to intoxicate mouse Y1 cells at near-wt levels. Failure to detect significantly less toxicity after overnight exposure of mouse Y1 adrenal cells to holotoxin variants with from 1 to 4 GM1 binding sites suggests that any differences in delivery of the wt CT-A1 fragment from the cell surface to the cytosol by these holotoxin variants were not rate limiting for development of the morphological manifestations of intoxication.",

Figure 4A to 4F shows the results of these experiments. Panel A shows that loss of even a single GM1 BS attenuated the activity of cholera toxin to some degree, an effect which increased as the number of native GM1 BS was lost. The time of onset of intoxication was also delayed as the number of native GM1 BS decreased. Nevertheless, toxin with a single native GM1 BS had clearly detectable activity. As expected, the G33D holotoxin with no native GM1 BS had almost no activity over the time frame of the experiment: 1.5% of wt toxin signal over baseline at 90 min and less than 9% of wt signal at 120 min. Since these variants have differing numbers of C-terminal GSH6 tags (zero, one, or two), we also examined the effect that the number of tags had on the activity of wt holotoxin with five BS (Fig. 4B). The presence of the tags modestly affected both the time of onset of intoxication, a measure of toxin-GM1 trafficking from the PM to the ER of host cells, and the rate of increase of Isc. The effect was greater for doubly tagged holotoxin, although it eventually showed a similar maximal Isc. To control for these effects of the B-subunit tags, toxins with different numbers of native GM1 BS but the same number of tags were compared. For these analyses, data were normalized by setting the maximal signal for the five native GM1 BS toxins in each comparison to 1.00 (Fig. 4C to F). For the toxin variants with one tag on the B subunit, the holotoxin with four native GM1 BS exhibited a slight (25%) attenuation of toxicity relative to holotoxin with five native GM1 BS, seen as a decrease in maximal Isc but with no delay in onset of intoxication (Fig. 4C). A similar result (30% decrease of maximal Isc) was seen for comparisons of the holotoxin variants with three or five native GM1 BS and two CTB-GSH6-tagged subunits (Fig. 4D). When the number of native GM1 BS was reduced to two or one in doubly or singly wt B-subunit-tagged holotoxin variants, the peak Isc decreased by more than 50% and also the onset of intoxication was delayed (Fig. 4E and 4F), suggesting defects in entry of CT into the cell or transport to the ER (or both).",

BFA- treated cells, however, still responded to addition of the cAMP agonist vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) at 90 min, showing that the toxin-treated cells retained viability and were competent for cAMP-dependent Cl\u2013 secretion (Isc). Thus, a toxin variant with a single native GM1 BS, like native CT holotoxin, traffics through a BFA-sensitive pathway to exert its toxic effects.",

We found that a subset of GM1 species, those with unsaturated ceramide domains, sorted efficiently from the PM to the trans-Golgi network and the ER. Cross-linking by toxin binding was dispensable for such GM1 trafficking, but membrane cholesterol and the lipid raft-associated proteins actin and flotillin were required. Our results implicated an endogenous protein-dependent mechanism of lipid sorting that is dependent on ceramide structure and could explain how the toxin gains access to the ER of host cells to induce disease (28).",

To do this, we prepared and purified homogenous preparations of holotoxins with defined numbers of GM1 BS. Monomeric binding of CT to single molecules of GM1 permits the holotoxin to intoxicate the host cell. Our results confirm and expand our studies on trafficking of the single GM1 lipids. Conversely, loss of even a single GM1 BS resulted in a measurable diminishment of toxicity in the T84 line of polarized human intestinal cells. This result is also consistent with findings of our studies of trafficking of the non-cross-linked GM1 molecules, where we found that GM1 cross-linking by toxin binding enhanced entry of CT into the ER. Thus, although multivalent binding to GM1 by CT is fundamentally dispensable, it does have a significant effect on retrograde trafficking from the cell surface to the ER and on toxicity.",

In the current studies, the loss of apparent avidity for the one-binding-site species is 10-fold, but the toxin still binds to GM1 applied to the well at nanomolar concentrations, suggesting this may not fully explain the strong loss of toxin function.",

We raise this idea because we observed that insertion of even a single CTB-G33D monomer into the pentameric B subunit rendered the holotoxin partially resistant to dissociation by SDS, and increasing the number of CTB-G33D monomers resulted in holotoxins that were completely resistant to dissociation by SDS. Conversely, there is no a priori reason to assume that the presence of one or more CTB-G33D polypeptides would affect chaperone-mediated release of CT-A1 from the nicked and reduced holotoxin in the ER, which appears to facilitate CT-A1 retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol (29).

Significantly, studies of the closely related AB5 subunit Shiga toxin show that multivalent binding to the glycosphingolipid GB3 spontaneously induces high-curvature membrane tubules by coupling the toxin-lipid complex to membrane shape (31). Multivalent binding of CT to GM1 in model membranes also induces spontaneous membrane curvature, implying a similar coupling of the toxin-glycosphingolipid complex formation to membrane shape (32, 34, 35). This could allow partitioning of the CT-GM1 complex into highly curved sorting tubules of the sorting endosome, which is required for retrograde transport, and explain why the toxins with more than 1 GM1 binding site are more potent in intoxication. It is also possible that multivalent binding to GM1 may be needed to activate intracellular signaling pathways that enhance uptake and trafficking, as for Shiga toxin (36).",

This strain does not metabolize arabinose and constitutively expresses the arabinose transporter, and therefore a uniform degree of induction occurs in all cells of a culture at any arabinose concentration. To produce the expression strains, genes encoding native-length CTB or carboxy-terminally extended CTB tagged with a glycosylation-sulfation signal (24) followed by a hexahistidine peptide were cloned on compatible plasmids with different selectable markers and inducible promoters. These encoded resistance to ampicillin (Ap) with the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter or resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) and the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter, along with the regulator araC. Variants of these CTB clones were also made with G33D substitutions that eliminate GM1 binding. A separate plasmid (pSlacbadCTA) selectable with spectinomycin (Sp) and compatible (with a pSC101 origin) with both ctxB plasmids was used to independently express the ctxA gene under control of both the lac and araBAD promoters. Each expression strain thus contained three plasmids, encoding a native CTB subunit (wt or G33D variant, Ap, and lac promoter), a GSH6-tagged CTB subunit (G33D or wt, Cm, and ara promoter), and the wt CTA subunit (Sp and ara and lac promoters). Details of construction, including full DNA sequences, are available on request. Plasmids created or used in this study are listed in Table 1. Plasmids pAlacCTB and pAlacCTBG33D encode Ap resistance and the wt and G33D native-length variants of CTB, respectively, under control of the lac promoter and have previously been published as pLMP1 and pLMP148, respectively (38). Carboxy-terminally linker-hexahistidine-tagged variants of CTB and CTB-G33D were made in a compatible Cmr arabinose-inducible vector, pAR3 (39), using the hexa-His tag from pT7sh6 (40) and a glycine-rich repeat from the M13 phage PIII protein, encoding XX (EX)4XDPRVPSS (where X is GGGS) inserted between residues 102 and 103 of CTB. Initial experiments to make wt and CTB-G33D mixed pentamers were done using these plasmids, but we saw significant proteolysis of the polyglycine linker-tagged variants, and subsequent experiments were done with variants that had the linker replaced with the GSH6 tag\u2014pCbadCTBGSH6 and pCbadCTBG33DGSH6.",
