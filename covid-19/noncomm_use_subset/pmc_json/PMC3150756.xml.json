They mediate these as a result of their cytotoxicity and cytokine-producing abilities, but the pathways activating and promoting engagement of NK cell effects are incompletely understood. During responses to viral infections, the antiviral cytokines, type 1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) stimulate both cellular resistance to viruses and NK cell cytotoxic function (3\u20135). The cytokines also have the potential to either promote or inhibit IFN-\u03b3 production in different cell types (5\u20137), but type 1 IFN enhancement of IFN-\u03b3 might not be important in NK cell responses to viruses because infections eliciting high systemic type 1 IFN levels are not associated with systemic NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production (8, 9). Instead, NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production in the presence of high type 1 IFN is elicited when interleukin-12 (IL-12) is induced and is dependent on this cytokine (4, 8). As a consequence, NK cell IFN-\u03b3 has not been readily detected during infections with viruses failing to stimulate IL-12 production.",

            "text": "The first described signaling pathway engaged by type 1 IFN binding to the specific heterodimeric receptor stimulates phosphorylation of the signaling and transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 (5, 10). Complexes, including these activated intermediaries, elicit expression of a wide range of gene products important for delivering direct antiviral functions. In addition, certain type 1 IFN immunoregulatory effects, including activation of NK cell cytotoxicity, are dependent on STAT1 (4, 11). There are a total of seven STAT molecules\u2014STAT1 through STAT6, with two STAT5s\u2014and type 1 IFNs conditionally activate all of these (5, 12), including STAT4, an important intermediary in IL-12 stimulation of NK cells as well as type 1 IFN stimulation of certain T cell populations for IFN-\u03b3 production (4, 13\u201315). Previous work from our group, examining responses in mouse spleens, has demonstrated that NK cells express high basal levels of STAT4 and that their exposure to type 1 IFNs activates STAT4 (9). Nevertheless, it has only been possible to identify the type 1 IFN induction of NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production during acute viral infections of STAT1-deficient but not of STAT1-complete mice because the concurrent induction of STAT1 by type 1 IFN and/or IFN-\u03b3 negatively regulates the response (6, 9). These results leave open the intriguing question of why a pathway from type 1 IFN to STAT4 activation under basal NK cell conditions would be evolutionarily preserved when it is rapidly turned off at times of type 1 IFN production.",

The system used for study was intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (7, 9, 16, 17). This infection has been well characterized and is of relevance to the human condition because LCMV can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunodeficient individuals (18\u201320). The virus is a potent inducer of type 1 IFN, with systemic levels produced in serum and spleen for several days after i.p. infection (7, 9, 17). In contrast, LCMV is a poor inducer of IL-12, with low to undetectable levels of the cytokine produced (8, 16), and NK cell IFN-\u03b3 expression is also low to undetectable in the serum and spleens of LCMV-infected mice (8, 9). Because the initial site of virus entry is the peritoneal cavity, the studies focused on previously uncharacterized events at this location.",

Studies under conditions of blocked type 1 IFN receptor access and/or deficiency in STAT4 conclusively demonstrated that NK cell IFN-\u03b3 expression was dependent on the type 1 IFNs and STAT4. The pathway enhanced the antiviral state. Interestingly, in comparison to other peritoneal populations, STAT1 induction in NK cells was delayed and separated from the NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response by 10 to 12 h. Thus, the results uncover a key role for type 1 IFN activation of NK cell IFN-\u03b3 and mechanistically resolve important issues concerning the earliest pathways to, sources of, and functions for IFN-\u03b3.",

The fluids were tested to evaluate cytokines released at the site. The IFN-\u03b3 levels were measured using a cytometric bead assay (CBA). Low but consistently detectable levels of IFN-\u03b3 were found peaking at 30 h after LCMV infection (Fig. 1A). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. In contrast to the reported extended kinetics of systemic levels of these cytokines (7, 9, 17) as well as the type 1 IFNs detected through 48 h after infection in serum samples taken from mice used for these experiments (data not shown), concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in the peritoneum reached their peak values of 340 and 69 pg/ml, respectively, at 30 h after challenge and were sharply confined to the 6-h periods surrounding that point (Fig. 1A). The levels of IL-12p70, a known inducer of IFN-\u03b3, were acquired from the CBAs. All samples were below the limit of detection for the assay, with no detectable levels in a large majority of samples isolated after 20 to 48 h of infection (Fig. 1A). Thus, the peritoneal cytokine responses to LCMV infection include early induction of IFN-\u03b3, with kinetically overlapping IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 production, but undetectable IL-12.",

Total lymphocytes were evaluated with an extended lymphocyte gate. The NK cell subpopulations were identified as NK1.1+ TCR-\u03b2\u2212 and the T cell subpopulations as NK1.1\u2212 TCR-\u03b2+. Lymphocytes isolated from uninfected mice, including total, NK, and T cells, did not basally express detectable IFN-\u03b3; the positive frequencies for all populations were <4% (Fig. 1B and C). By 24 h after challenge with LCMV, approximately 14 to 37% of the NK cells expressed moderate to high levels of intracellular IFN-\u03b3. The peak of this NK cell response was at 30 h after infections, when 28 to 43% of the NK cells expressed IFN-\u03b3. The response was resolving at 36 to 48 h. In contrast to the NK cells, neither total lymphocyte nor T cell populations had high IFN-\u03b3 levels at any of the times examined (Fig. 1B and C). These results demonstrate that during LCMV infection, peritoneal NK cells respond with IFN-\u03b3 expression and are the major producers of the cytokine in the peritoneal cavity.",

Consistent with our earlier studies (8), all samples had IL-12p40 levels at or below the limit of detection for the assay (data not shown). To determine if biologically relevant IL-12 was induced below detection limits, uninfected and LCMV-infected mice were treated with control antibody or anti-IL-12p40 antibody neutralizing the function of biologically active IL-12p70 (8). As a positive control for an IL-12-induced IFN-\u03b3 response (21, 22), mice were given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) i.p. at 6 h prior to harvest. In comparison to LCMV infection, LPS treatment induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in lavage fluids (Fig. 2A) and higher proportions of NK cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2B). The enhanced response to LPS was blocked by the anti-IL-12 treatment. In contrast, the IFN-\u03b3 response to LCMV infection was resistant to the anti-IL-12 treatment (Fig. 2A and B). Thus, IL-12 is not required for the NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response elicited by the virus.",

The first examined responses in cells from uninfected and 30-h LCMV-infected immunocompetent mice that had been treated with control antibodies or antibodies blocking access to the type 1 IFN receptor, anti-IFNAR (23). As shown in Fig. 3A, the infected control-treated mice had the expected 25 to 30% of their NK cells expressing IFN-\u03b3, but this response was reduced to <1% in the infected mice treated with antibodies against IFNAR. The second approach examined responses in mice that were blocked in type 1 IFN responsiveness as a result of genetic mutation of the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) (24). In comparison to the up to 36% of NK cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 in wild-type (WT)-infected mice, <1% of the NK cells in the infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed IFN-\u03b3 at 30 h after LCMV infection (Fig. 3B).

Cells from recipient and donor mice were distinguished by expression of the CD45.1 or CD45.2 allele, with recipient mice being CD45.1+ and donor mice being CD45.1\u2212 (Fig. 3C). For these studies, WT and IFNAR-deficient PECs were prepared and transferred into WT recipient mice prior to LCMV infection. None of the populations expressed IFN-\u03b3 when recipients remained uninfected (Fig. 3C; 0 h after LCMV). When WT PECs were transferred into WT recipients, both donor and recipient NK cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 at 30 h after infection, with overall mean expression of 23 and 21%, respectively (Fig. 3C). In contrast, transferred NK cells isolated from IFNAR-deficient mice were significantly decreased in their ability to express IFN-\u03b3, with expression averaging approximately 4% compared to 22% of WT recipient NK cells (Fig. 3C).

To define the effects of STAT4 loss within NK cells in a WT environment of infection, adoptive transfer experiments were carried out using PEC donor cells isolated from WT or STAT4-deficient mice and then delivered into WT recipient mice. The donor cells were identified by lack of CD45.1 expression and the recipient cells by CD45.1 expression (Fig. 4B). None of the populations expressed IFN-\u03b3 when recipients remained uninfected (Fig. 4B; 0 h after LCMV infection).

The experiments demonstrated high basal STAT4 levels in NK cells (Fig. 5A). The trait was unique to NK cells, with only low proportions of total lymphocytes and T cells expressing STAT4 and only doing so at lower levels, and NK cells retained their unique high levels of STAT4 throughout infection (Fig. 5A). In contrast, all populations isolated from uninfected mice were low for STAT1, but expression in the NK cells was always slightly lower (Fig. 5B). Following LCMV infection, the total lymphocyte and T cell populations rapidly elevated STAT1 expression, with 80 to 95% of the populations expressing high levels of STAT1 by 40 h after infection (Fig. 5B to D). The peritoneal NK cells also had STAT1 levels induced during the infection, but in comparison to the other populations, there was a delay, requiring upwards of 8 to 16 h longer than total lymphocytes and T cells to reach 50% high levels of STAT1-expressing cells (Fig. 5B to E). Thus, the NK cell populations uniquely express high levels of STAT4 basally and after infection.

To determine the physiologic relevance of the peritoneal IFN-\u03b3 response, viral burdens were measured in samples collected from WT mice and mice rendered unresponsive to IFN-\u03b3 as a result of genetic mutation of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212) (25). The IFN-\u03b3R-deficient mice had significant increases in LCMV titers of approximately 1 log at 30 h after infection (Fig. 6A). Experiments evaluating the requirement for NK cells demonstrated that in comparison to control antibody treatments, antibodies to NK1.1 depleted the following: (i) the NK cells from the PECs isolated from uninfected and infected mice (Fig. 6B), (ii) the major population expressing intracellular IFN-\u03b3 after infection (Fig. 6B), and (iii) the levels of detectable IFN-\u03b3 in lavage fluids collected at 30 h following challenge (Fig. 6C). The effects were accompanied by proportional increases in viral titers (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the IFN-\u03b3 responses have an impact on controlling the viral burden in the peritoneal cavity during LCMV infection and that NK cells are required for the optimal IFN-\u03b3 response, and its effects.",

Production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in the peritoneal cavity was shown to peak at 30 h after LCMV infection. NK cells were the major producers of IFN-\u03b3 and uniquely expressed high levels of STAT4. The pathway for induction of NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production was dependent on responsiveness to type 1 IFNs and on the STAT4 signaling molecule. The elicited IFN-\u03b3 enhanced defense because loss of responsiveness to the factor resulted in increased viral burdens. Thus, type 1 IFN induction of IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells, dependent on STAT4, is conclusively proven to occur and to lead to downstream effects under immunocompetent conditions.",

Nevertheless, it has only been possible to identify type 1 IFN activation of STAT4 and IFN-\u03b3 in the spleens of STAT1-deficient mice during LCMV infection because the type 1 IFNs and IFN-\u03b3 induce STAT1 levels to block the pathway to STAT4 (9). The results reported here answer the question of why a pathway from type 1 IFN to STAT4 for IFN-\u03b3 expression would be maintained when it is rapidly turned off by concurrent STAT1 induction; it is used to locally access a short burst of IFN-\u03b3 at very early times after infection. In this case, \u201clocally\u201d is the peritoneal cavity. In addition to the detectable NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response, innate responses to LCMV at this site differed from the well-characterized responses in spleen and serum (7, 9, 17) with regard to the kinetics and magnitude of type 1 IFN production and the kinetics of STAT1 induction in NK cells (9). Type 1 IFN production in the peritoneal cavity was very early and of short duration\u2014detectable at 24 h, peaking at 30 h, and resolving by 36 h after infection (Fig. 1)\u2014and although total lymphocytes and T cells had dramatically elevated STAT1 levels early, induction was delayed by 8 to 16 h in the NK cells (Fig. 5). Thus, in contrast to the spleen, the environment in the peritoneal cavity allows type 1 IFN to access STAT4 prior to STAT1 induction in NK cells (Fig. 7).",

            "text": "Why was STAT1 elevation delayed in the NK cells compared to the other PEC populations examined? Promoter sequences in the STAT1 gene specific for STAT1 complexes may act to enhance STAT1 induction whenever STAT1 is activated (26). Thus, any cytokine signaling through STAT1 would be expected to induce elevated STAT1 levels. In addition to type 1 IFN receptors, receptors for IFN-\u03b3 also activate STAT1 (10). The results presented here suggest that NK cells might first respond to type 1 IFN exposure with IFN-\u03b3 because of their high STAT4 levels, but once IFN-\u03b3 is induced, it acts back on the cells to induce STAT1. This would explain the delay in STAT1 induction in NK cells compared to other subsets. Alternatively or additionally, it might just take longer for type 1 IFN to induce STAT1 in populations with high STAT4 levels. The NK cells in both the spleen (9) and peritoneum (Fig. 5) consistently have lower levels of STAT1. Because the spleen is a secondary compartment of infection, most of the NK cells may be experiencing cytokines produced earlier at other sites and/or not be synchronized to make a detectable short burst of IFN-\u03b3 in this compartment. In any case, it is remarkable that there is a window of opportunity for IFN-\u03b3 production under the conditions in the peritoneum given the link between this response and shutting it off. The pathway suggests that there will be a very early source of NK cell IFN-\u03b3 whenever type 1 IFNs are induced.",

Type 1 IFNs have long been known to exert antiviral effects and enhance NK cell cytotoxicity through the activation of STAT1 (4, 5, 11). The NK cells, however, are positioned to respond to type 1 IFNs with STAT4 activation because high basal levels of STAT4 are associated with the type 1 IFN receptor (9). Increasing the endogenous levels of total STAT1 protein negatively regulates STAT4 access in part by displacing STAT4 from the receptor, and this induction of STAT1, as observed in the spleen, is beneficial because it protects from dysregulated systemic IFN-\u03b3 production and cytokine-mediated disease (9). In contrast, the results reported here show that the type 1 IFNs have early access to STAT4 and the NK cell IFN-\u03b3 pathway prior to STAT1 induction and that this pathway promotes resistance to infection. Recent studies have shown that similar STAT4-STAT1 regulation is in place in humans; type 1 IFNs induce STAT4 activation in NK cells isolated from healthy individuals, but the response is diminished in NK cells from individuals chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. The activation of STAT4 negatively correlates with STAT1 levels in these populations (29). Thus, modulation of STAT4 and STAT1 concentrations in different cell types under different conditions of infections in mice and humans helps explain how type 1 IFNs can enhance or antagonize IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, and the studies with mice provide explanations for how the balance, in both directions, works to the benefit of the host. A change in relative STAT ratios might also play a role in conditioning NK cells to modify type 1 IFN responses from promoting cytokine production to enhancing cytotoxic function.",

            "text": "In addition to our earlier studies with STAT1-deficient mice, there have been a few other reports suggesting a role of type 1 IFN in NK cell IFN-\u03b3 expression. One examined a number of activation responses, including intracellular IFN-\u03b3, of type 1 IFN receptor-deficient compared to WT NK cells following in vitro exposure to vaccinia virus and dendritic cells (30). Early in vivo IFN-\u03b3 induction has been reported in the mouse peritoneum during different viral infections (31), and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 expression by splenic NK cells has been observed following treatments with the chemical analogue of viral nucleic acids, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I \u00b7 C)] (32, 33). These in vivo studies, however, have been done under conditions where the type 1 IFN effects were not delineated from those that might have been mediated by other cytokines induced under the experimental conditions used, including reported IL-12. In one study with poly(I \u00b7 C) (32), the intracellular NK cell IFN-\u03b3 expression was shown to be blocked by treatments with antibodies neutralizing type 1 IFN function, but the consequences of the treatments on other cytokine responses were not evaluated. Here, in vivo responses under which the type 1 IFN receptor was blocked were evaluated by different approaches, including adoptive transfer of peritoneal populations from WT or type 1 IFN receptor-deficient mice into WT-infected mice (Fig. 3). This method allows direct comparison of donor and recipient cells in the context of the complete endogenous immune responses. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of type 1 IFNs inducing IFN-\u03b3 production from NK cells under immunocompetent conditions of viral infection.",

            "text": "The studies do not exclude possible roles for accessory cytokines in enhancing type 1 IFN induction of IFN-\u03b3. Certainly, IL-12 is an activator of STAT4 and a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 (13, 34). The cytokine IL-18 can enhance the stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 by either type 1 IFNs or IL-12 (7, 35\u201337), and new studies deciphering pathways from different sensors have demonstrated synergism between type 1 IFNs and IL-12 for IFN-\u03b3 induction in human cells (38). The results presented here, however, suggest that there may be a short burst of IFN-\u03b3 induced by type 1 IFNs independent of IL-12, and our previous work examining murine cytomegalovirus infections of mice has shown that induced type 1 IFNs promote NK cell cytotoxicity but IL-12 is required for splenic and systemic NK cell IFN-\u03b3 (3, 4). The experiments carried out here neutralizing IL-12 in vivo show that IL-12 does not play a role in the LCMV-induced NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the positive controls for these studies (i.e., effects on LPS induction of IFN-\u03b3 in the peritoneal cavity) (Fig. 2) demonstrate that when it is elicited, IL-12 is important in eliciting a peritoneal NK cell IFN-\u03b3, but also that there is residual NK cell IFN-\u03b3 after neutralization. This is consistent with early reports of incomplete IFN-\u03b3 blockade by IL-12 neutralization following LPS treatment in other settings (21) and the known LPS induction of IFN-\u03b2 (39). Taken together, the studies suggest that IL-12 is an important inducer of NK cell IFN-\u03b3 if elicited and the critical cytokine for IFN-\u03b3 induction once STAT1 levels are increased. There are likely to be additional regulatory factors in play, however, as the presence of STAT1 eventually results in reduced IFN-\u03b3 induction by either type 1 IFNs or IL-12 (6). Thus, much remains to be done to map the complex interactions between type 1 IFN and IL-12 for shaping NK cell responses, but eliciting different type 1 IFN and IL-12 responses may be part of directing the magnitude of, and continued access to, the NK cell IFN-\u03b3 response.",

            "text": "The peritoneal responses reported here demonstrate that by being receptive to early type 1 IFN signaling with IFN-\u03b3 production, NK cells can serve as sensors for and responders to the presence of viral pathogens. The studies surprisingly reveal a previously elusive role for NK cells in early defense against LCMV. In comparison to other viral infections in compartments outside the peritoneal cavity, LCMV has been shown to be relatively insensitive to the direct antiviral effects of NK cells (40\u201342) or IFN-\u03b3 (43). Our previous attempts to access NK cell IFN-\u03b3 in defense against LCMV have shown that administration of IL-12 prior to infection can induce the response to result in under a 1-log decrease in splenic viral titers (44). In this report, infection-induced IFN-\u03b3, dependent on NK cells, was shown to proportionally limit viral burden at this first site of infection. Thus, though modest, there is a documented effect of the NK cells and IFN-\u03b3 during LCMV infection. The mechanism for the antiviral effect mediated by IFN-\u03b3 is not known. Given the rapid kinetics, it is likely to be a result of the activation of direct antiviral effects in infected cells or macrophages rather than enhancement of adaptive immune functions resulting from promoting major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 expression or CD8 T cell effector functions (45). It remains to be determined whether or not the NK cell IFN-\u03b3 elicited by type 1 IFNs will be a more important first response in defense against other more sensitive viral infections and/or for promoting immunoregulatory functions.",

Briefly, PECs were incubated with 2.4G2 antibody (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) to block nonspecific binding to the Fc receptor. Cell surface staining was then performed with antibodies specific for the following: TCR-\u03b2\u2013FITC, TCR-\u03b2\u2013peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP), NK1.1-phycoerythrin (PE) (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA), TCR-\u03b4\u2013FITC, and CD45.1-FITC (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For cell surface staining only, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. For intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and then stained with IFN-\u03b3\u2013allophycocyanin (APC) (BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining of total STAT1 and STAT4, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm and then further fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold pure methanol. Subsequent staining was performed with combinations of STAT1-PE and STAT4-APC (custom prepared by BD Biosciences). The following isotype controls were included in each experiment: mouse IgG2a, mouse IgG2b, mouse IgG1, rat IgG1, rat IgG2a, rat IgG2b, and hamster IgG (BD Biosciences or eBioscience). Samples were acquired using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with the CellQuest Pro software package (BD Biosciences). Laser outputs were 15 mW at 488- and 635-nm wavelengths. At least 120,000 events were collected within a live-cell gate that was determined by forward and side scatter. Analysis of flow cytometric data was performed using FlowJo9 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).",

The results presented here studying the peritoneal cavity show that both type 1 IFNs and the viral burden peak at 30 h. This is correlated with an early peak in IFN-\u03b3 production in NK cells. NK cell production of IFN-\u03b3 occurs before STAT1 levels have risen. Previous work with the spleen has shown that a more vigorous peak in viral load and type 1 IFNs is seen between 2 and 3 days after LCMV infection with a concurrent rise in STAT1 (7). Type 1 IFNs are unable to access STAT4-dependent IFN-\u03b3 production due to the earlier rise in STAT1 levels. The response in the peritoneum promotes antiviral defense.
