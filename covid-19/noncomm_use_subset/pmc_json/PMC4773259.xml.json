Although laboratory guidelines or resources for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV had been provided by several international authoritative bodies [45], the Korean version of guideline was required in the unexperienced situation of the nationwide outbreak, which developed rapidly by intra-hospital and inter-hospital spread of an imported deadly virus. This outbreak was beyond national capacity of laboratory preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the KSLM MERS-CoV LR-TF decided to provide the clinical laboratories with the laboratory practice guidelines of national standard for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV. On behalf of the Central MERS-CoV Control Office in Korea, organized by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (KMHW), the first version of the KSLM laboratory practice guidelines was issued on June 12, 2015.",

Specimen collection is guided that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal walls, respectively, not just from the nostril or mouth. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs could be placed in the same viral transport medium. Synthetic fiber flocked swabs with plastic shafts should be used to increase virus yield. Calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts are not recommended because they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR reactions. In asymptomatic individuals, induced sputum or forced coughing may help collect lower respiratory tract specimens. The rRT-PCR of serum samples can be helpful for detecting MERS-CoV, but these assays are not recommended for the routine diagnostic process in MERS-CoV outbreaks.",

On the basis of WHO interim recommendations [4], serological testing for MERS-CoV can be used to identify confirmed MERS cases that can be reported under the International Health Regulations, to survey population-based seroprevalence and to investigate past exposures. Because a total of 16,693 people were self-quarantined owing to contact history with confirmed MERS-CoV cases, investigation of seroprevalence in this population is necessary in order to understand the epidemiology and pathophysiology of MERS-CoV infection [2]. It is recommended that serum samples be collected during the acute stage of the disease, preferably during the first week after illness onset and again during convalescence, at least 14 to 21 days after the acute stage sample was collected. If the acute stage sampling is missed, it should be collected at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms [411].",
