            "text": "Macrophages were first identified by Elie Metchnikoff as phagocytic cells which helped to eliminate pathogens in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In 1905, his research findings suggested that macrophages from infected animals had elevated ability of killing bacteria, thereby proposing the basis of the concept of macrophage activation 1. After six decades of efforts, the mechanisms with regard to killing bacteria of macrophages were gradually elucidated, but there were still no definite answers about how macrophages became more efficient bacterial killers. In 1973, North and his colleagues found that independent cellular factors could also promote resistance of infection without involvement of pathogens 2. Almost at the same time, David indicated that lymphocytes were the major antigen-specific cells responsible for microbicidal activation of macrophages 3. Soon after that, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, produced by lymphocytes, was identified as the first factor for interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes 4. It transforms resting macrophages into active ones which have stronger antigen presenting capacity and complement mediated phagocytosis, and secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as toxic mediators. As the first type of antimicrobial macrophage activation was recognized, it became known as classically activated macrophages (CAM, also known as M1).",

            "text": "In 1989, when the heterogeneity in the helper T-cell compartment was subsequently reported, Mosrnann and Coffman reviewed the different functions and lymphokines secretion between two types of cloned helper T cells (Th), and proposed the concept of Th1 and Th2 5. One year later, Abramson and his colleagues recognized that interleukin (IL)-4, which was mainly produced by Th2 cells, could convert macrophages into a special activation state compared with IFN-\u03b3 induced activation in which respiratory burst was inhibited and major histocompatibility complex class II antigens (MHC-II) expression was increased 6. With the discovery of up-regulation of macrophage mannose receptor (MRC1) as a specific marker of IL-4/IL-13-activated macrophages in 1992, which was coupled with the enhanced expression of MHC-II, the concept of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM, also known as M2) was first proposed 7. In the following years, when the plasticity of macrophages in response to different environment was gradually studied, Mosser and Edwards reviewed the full spectrum of macrophage activation and pointed out that M1 and M2 were two terminals of the spectrum 8. In addition to IL-4/IL-13, a great number of stimuli, such as antibody immune complexes together with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-1, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), glucocorticoids and IL-10, were found to have the ability of alternative activation of macrophages. As they shared properties with IL-4/IL-13-activated macrophages, a new functional state called M2-like phenotype 9 was proposed, and it held great promise for the research of macrophage activation in a dynamic microenvironment (Figure 1).",

Generally, macrophages are deliberated to be polarized toward an M1 phenotype in the early stage of bacterial infection. When the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented in bacteria are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptors, TLRs), macrophages are activated and produce a large amount of pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and nitric oxide (NO), which kill the invading organisms and activate the adaptive immunity11. This mechanism has been considered to be involved in infection with Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes 21, and the early phases of  infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Mycobacterium avium 22. If macrophage-mediated inflammatory response cannot be quickly controlled, a cytokine storm is formed, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of severe sepsis 23.",

For example, microarray analysis and transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood cells showed that typical M1 genes and M1-related genes were replaced by M2 signature during treatment or convalescence in patients with typhoid fever 25. LPS, large molecules in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, play a critical pro-inflammatory role in acute infections. As the infection persists, host may present a LPS-tolerant state, and macrophages are polarized to M2 phenotype. A recent study has confirmed that the p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB served as the key regulator of M2-driven LPS-tolerant state in this transformation 26. As the excessive injury is reduced, however, M2 phenotype macrophages also induce an immunosuppressive state, resulting in a more susceptible situation to re-infection, thus relapse may occur or a carrier state may be found.",

For instance, Kupffer cells (KCs) limit the severity of the virally infected liver through removing apoptotic hepatocytes in a manner dependent on scavenger receptors and thus play a major pathological role in chronic virus associated diseases 31; alveolar macrophage is not only the monitor of clearing daily cellular debris, but also the initiator of a strong inflammation response to viral infection 32. In addition, as the major target of HIV-1 infection, resident macrophage acts as viral reservoir which protects HIV-1 from hostile elements and induces HIV-1 associated neurological damage 33, 34.",

In general, macrophages undergo a dynamic switch toward M2 phenotype. For instance, during the early stage of Taenia crassiceps infestation, it is characterized by responses of Th1-driven M1 phenotype macrophages, however, as infection goes to a late stage, Th2-driven IL-4-mediated M2 phenotype would become dominant with a decreased parasite burden 22. In addition, different subtypes of parasite show different macrophage phenotypes during infection. Toxoplasma gondii has been shown to have three distinct clonal lineages, type I, type II, and type III, and they differ in virulence. Type I and III infected macrophages are alternatively activated through activation of STAT6 by Toxoplasma rhoptry kinase ROP16, but type II infected macrophages are classically activated through activation of NF-\u03baB by Toxoplasma dense granule protein GRA15 35. Moreover, it is not a terminal differentiation for M2 phenotype in parasite infestation. In a recent study, utilizing a murine model of filarial infection demonstrated that macrophages which are exposed to Th2 cytokines and anti-inflammatory signals in vivo for a long time could still develop a classically activated phenotype in response to LPS or IFN-\u03b3, and become antimicrobial through producing NO 36.",

Some important molecules are involved in this process. For example, in Leishmania infantum infection, Dectin-1 and mannose receptor, two kinds of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed on macrophages, respectively activate Sykp47phox and arachidonic acid-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways, and they are crucial for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and also trigger Syk-coupled signaling for caspase-1 induced IL-1\u03b2 release. In contrast, specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin receptor 3 (SIGNR3), another kind of CLRs, helps parasite resilience through inhibition of the leukotriene (LTB) 4-IL-1\u03b2 axis. Therefore, CLRs are key modulators for macrophage polarization, and are served as potential targets for prevention as well as treatment of Leishmania infantum infection 37. Arg1 is not only an important marker of M2 phenotype macrophages but also a regulator of the immune response in parasite infestation. A study using myeloid cell restricted Arg1 deficiency Schistosoma mansoni infection model suggested that Arg1 appeared to be a key mediator for the development of helminth infestation through restraining both unrestricted Th2-mediated fibrotic pathology and intestinal damage associated with increased Th1/Th17 cytokines, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 levels, and endotoxemia38, 39. However, it is not a generalized effect in the pathogenesis of parasite infestation. Arg1 blockade or deficiency in hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages had little effect on response to acute orchronic infection by Trichuris muris40.",

Adaptation to cold temperature promoted the ATM to the alternative activation state, which secreted catecholamines to induce the expression of thermogenic genes including PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1a (Ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (Acsl1) in brown adipose tissue, and the lipolysis in white adipose tissue was also increased 61. By this way, ATM keeps the cellular functions and physiological processes in the normal state when confronted with cold environments.",

In liver tumors, macrophages (known as Kupffer cells) engulf and kill circulating tumor cells in an M1-like manner, and the depletion of Kupffer cells in rats enhances metastasis 72. However, TAM is transformed into M2-like phenotype in the development of tumors, and NF-\u03baB signal pathway is down-regulated 73. During the stage of invasion and migration, TAM is converted into M2 phenotype upon the stimulation of IL-4 secreted by CD4+ T cells and tumor cells, and functions as the key to the gate of invasion of tumor cells 74. Mechanistically, TAM migrates and synthesizes epidermal growth factor (EGF) under the stimulation of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 secreted by tumor cells, in turn activating the migration of tumor cells 75. More interestingly, TAM and tumor cells migrate in lock-step, and both migration and chemotaxis of them could be inhibited by either the EGF or CSF-1 signaling pathways 64. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and matrix metalloproteinases 9 secreted by TAM could impair the matrix, and help tumor cells escape from the basement membrane, which is another important regulator of invasion of tumor cells 76. In a word, the distinct phenotypes of macrophages regulate the activity of tumor cells in the different stages of tumors, which provide an attractive target for the treatment in the future.",

However, excessive M2 macrophages may increase cell recruitment and mucus secretion, and result in airway hyper-responsiveness. Moreira and colleagues transferred M2 phenotype macrophages into the lungs of fungus-induced asthmatic mice, then, both the inflammatory response and collagen deposition were enhanced, in turn accelerating the pathophysiological process of asthma 84. With a boom in research of macrophage polarization, growing evidences support that M1 phenotype macrophages contribute to the development of asthma. In severe forms of asthma, especially in patients resistant to glucocorticoid therapy, macrophages are shown to become an M1 phenotype, which produces a great amount of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NO, exacerbates the lung injury and accelerate the airway remodeling 85. For instance, NO produced by M1 phenotype leads to oxidative DNA damage and inflammation, enhances mucus production, and amplifies the lung injury in murine model of allergen-induced airway disease 86.

Clinical or laboratory evidence for sepsis being an immunosuppressive disorder has been proposed by Hotchkiss 87: apoptosis of the immune cells, relative increase in regulatory T cells 88 as well as myeloid derived suppressor cells 89, thereby weakening the defense to pathogens. Subsequently a secondary infection occurs which acting as the leading cause of death in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. As a kind of fugitive cells which change their phenotypes in the various microenvironments, macrophages probably participate in the development of immunosuppressive state in septic response by polarizing to an M2 phenotype. Porta and colleagues found that LPS-tolerant macrophages shared the same characters with M2 macrophages, and p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB was the key regulator to the process 26. Therefore, uncovering the mechanisms in the polarization of macrophages in different stages of sepsis and regulating the balance of it may hold great promise for the treatment of septic complications.",

Firstly, cellular markers that distinguish the phenotypes of macrophages during inflammatory diseases need further studies to confirm. For example, some recent studies found that it was not appropriate to identify TAM through the expression of CD68 as it was also expressed by other stromal populations, so the conclusions drawn from CD68 as the marker of TAM should be further evaluated 77, 90. Secondly, it is usually not convenient to acquire fresh macrophages of human, so most of human studies now are conducted to perform from cell lines, which are not exactly perfect and hinder the transformation to the clinical trials. Thirdly, marked differences exist between mouse and human macrophages. For example, Arg1, marker of mouse M2 macrophages, is not expressed by in vitro polarized human macrophages 91. Thus, it is difficult for the preclinical development of therapies based on mouse models if the differences between mouse and human could not be fully investigated 92.",
