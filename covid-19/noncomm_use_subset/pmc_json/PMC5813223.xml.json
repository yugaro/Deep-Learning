However, Lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression, and rejection may be asymptomatic. In addition, there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection.4 For example, viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss.5 Moreover, growth of bacteria or fungi in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cultures does not always represent infection, as bacterial and fungal colonization of the transplanted lung is common. Infections with multidrug\u2010resistant bacteria pose an increasing threat to solid organ transplant recipients, and the discrimination between infection and colonization is important before starting long\u2010term treatment of resistant bacteria with the possible side effects and interactions.6\n",

In this study, we quantified the two proteins together with the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u20108 and TNF, and anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u201010 in BALF collected during the first year after transplantation.

Other studies have demonstrated that HBP is a better diagnostic marker of infection than neutrophil counts in cerebrospinal fluid during meningitis, in urine during urinary tract infection, and in plasma during sepsis.12, 13, 14 In the present study, HBP was more sensitive in diagnosing infection compared to grade of inflammation in TBB and cytology. However, this analysis is semi\u2010quantitative only, and further studies are required to evaluate how HBP and the other markers compare to neutrophil counts in BAL.",

IL\u201010 has anti\u2010inflammatory properties but showed the same pattern as the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in this study. IL\u201010 is believed to play an important role in balancing the inflammatory response in order to limit host tissue damage.19 For example, compared to wild\u2010type mice, IL\u201010\u2013deficient mice demonstrate more efficient bacterial clearance but higher mortality and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection,20 which underscores the regulatory role of IL\u201010 during infection. It could therefore be speculated that IL\u201010 increases simultaneously with pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in order to avoid excessive inflammation that would be harmful to the host.",

However, with infection, urea concentrations might increase in BALF due to inflammation and increased plasma leakage, thus causing a false low biomarker level when adjusting to a urea plasma/BAL coefficient. Moreover, not all BALF samples could be urea adjusted, as a corresponding plasma sample was missing, which gives the test less power. Even so, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20108, and HBP showed significantly higher values with infection. In line with our findings, it was recently shown that IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 in BALF are potential markers of ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia (VAP),21 which further strengthens their utility as biomarkers.",

Contrary to our results, Patella et al have demonstrated increased levels of IL\u201010 during rejection compared to no rejection.22 One possible reason for this discrepancy is that rejection is defined differently in the two studies. Here, we identify rejection with TBB to ensure correct diagnosis. All tested biomarkers have in common that they indicate neutrophil\u2010dominated inflammation. In contrast, rejection is primarily a T cell\u2013driven process,23 which may explain why none of the markers in this study were elevated in this group. However, the distinction is difficult as infection can drive rejection, and TBB staging can also be false positive in the presence of infection. In our study, all but two patients with rejection had repeated positive TBBs, which increases the likelihood of true results.",

Second, even if efforts were made to have a standardized protocol for BAL procedure and study sampling, we cannot fully estimate the dilution factor. However, with the described urea method we have tried to address this problem. Another difficulty was the definition of infection in these patients. We have made efforts to ensure that the groups definite and no infection are correct. However, there is a risk of misclassification in the groups possible and probable infection, as infection is difficult to diagnose in these patients and some may be colonized with bacteria rather than infected. Moreover, a large proportion of patients with clinically suspected infection had received prior antibiotic or antifungal treatment at the time of bronchoscopy, which may have affected the grading of infection. If present, this misclassification would likely bias the estimates towards the null, as prior treatment may result in false negative cultures and possibly decreasing levels of the biomarkers. Despite a potential for misclassification, we could demonstrate that all tested biomarkers, and especially HBP, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20108, increase with infection.",
