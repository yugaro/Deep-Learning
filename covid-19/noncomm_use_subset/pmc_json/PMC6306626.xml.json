Thus, ensuring vaccination of HCWs at Hajj is very important to protect themselves and their patients. These include mandatory meningococcal vaccine, and highly recommended influenza vaccine; both are funded for HCWs who care for Hajj pilgrims. Yet, the uptake of these vaccines among HCWs at Hajj has been suboptimal[31-35], there is no data on pneumococcal vaccine uptake among HCWs at Hajj. In previous reports non-availability of vaccine and lack of time were key barriers to vaccination among HCWs at Hajj[34,35], however the latest data are not known, and no data on facilitators of vaccination.",

Any participant reporting at least one of these underlying medical conditions and/or aged \u2265 65 years was considered \u201cat increased risk\u201d.

A false belief among HCWs that they were up-to-date with their vaccinations and that they did not need any more vaccines for Hajj attendance was a key barrier. This belief may have stemmed from their lack of awareness about the requirement and the availability of Hajj vaccines, and their presumption that just for joining the congregation they may not need the vaccinations since they were local residents. HCWs\u2019 reliance on other preventive measures and their claimed ability to know how to ward off an infection without vaccination were other important barriers. Some of these barriers were previously reported among HCWs serving at Hajj[34,35]. Workplace vaccination campaigns could make a difference and was found to be successful in Saudi Arabia. For instance, assigning a dedicated nurse in each department to conduct vaccinations during an annual in-hospital campaign increased staff influenza vaccination up to three folds at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia (from 29% to 77%, 81% and 67%)[45].",

However, this study is fraught with limitations. Small sample size is a key limitation of this survey, HCWs are too busy to complete a survey form, hence like most other surveys involving HCWs at Hajj it has a small sample size. Also, the data are self-reported, and we had no way to validate their vaccination histories but since HCWs are expected to have sufficient health literacy the information are considered to be reliable. The survey did not distinguish between polysaccharide and conjugate meningococcal vaccines, and both vaccines were used in Saudi Arabia during the survey period. Furthermore, the questionnaire did not distinguish those who received the meningococcal vaccine in the previous years versus the current year. Finally, since the survey was online and because we wanted to make it simple for the busy HCWs, we did not ask about reasons for receipt or non-receipt of individual vaccines, so the responses received could be meant for any one or all the three vaccines.",
