Before each influenza season, a community cohort was defined based on residency in or near Marshfield, Wisconsin, and receipt of care from the Marshfield Clinic. Individuals in the community cohort were eligible to be recruited when seeking care for acute respiratory illness in outpatient clinics (all seasons) or in the hospital setting (2004\u20132005 through 2009\u20132010). Each season, recruitment began when influenza activity was detected in the community and usually continued for 12\u201315 weeks. Symptom eligibility criteria varied by season but included fever/feverishness or cough during most seasons. For the 2011\u20132012 through 2015\u20132016 seasons, eligibility was based on the presence of acute respiratory illness with cough. The maximum duration of illness was 10 days for the 2004\u20132005 through 2006\u20132007 seasons and 7 days for all subsequent seasons. After obtaining informed consent, a midturbinate swab was obtained for influenza detection. Symptoms and onset date were assessed during the enrollment interview. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed each season to identify influenza cases. After testing was complete, aliquots of samples in viral transport media were frozen at \u201380\u00b0C.",

Seasonal incidence is reported as episodes of medically attended RSV illness per 10 000 population. A detailed description of the incidence estimation procedure was published previously [27]. Briefly, all estimates were standardized to a 31-week period from approximately early October through early May using Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene surveillance data. Incidence calculations were based on 2 assumptions: (1) test results from enrolled patients can be extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members with a respiratory illness visit during the enrollment period; and (2) the number of RSV cases occurring outside the enrollment period in the cohort was proportional to the number of statewide cases occurring outside the enrollment period. Poisson regression with analytic weights, offsets, and robust variance estimation was used to estimate seasonal incidence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and test for linear trends in seasonal incidence. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",

The overall seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV illness was 139 cases per 10 000 (95% CI, 122\u2013160).

There was a significant decline in the incidence of medically attended RSV from 2006\u20132007 through 2015\u20132016 for the entire cohort (P = .003, chi-square test for trend) and for those with cardiopulmonary disease (P = .014, chi-square test for trend). The incidence of medically attended RSV was also higher in women compared with men (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09\u20131.95). The overall incidence rates of medically attended illness caused by RSV A and RSV B were nearly identical (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75\u20131.35), although 1 or the other subtype was often dominant during a single season. The temporal trend in RSV incidence suggests an overall reduction among adults \u226560 years of age after the 2011\u20132012 season (Figure 1).",

Prospective RSV illness surveillance in nearly 3000 healthy, working-age adults from 1975 to 1995 demonstrated that 84% of RSV infections were symptomatic [30]. Of the latter, 22% involved the lower respiratory tract (tracheobronchitis or wheezing).

In this study, we found that RSV-msLRTD at the time of enrollment was significantly associated with a serious clinical outcome. In particular, patients with RSV-msLRTD at enrollment were significantly more likely to require hospital admission and were also more likely to develop pneumonia during the follow-up period. The incremental risk (absolute risk difference) for each of these outcomes exceeded 20% when RSV-msLRTD was present at enrollment. These findings suggest that RSV-msLRTD may be a useful surrogate measure to identify individuals at risk for more serious clinical end points in trials of vaccines and antivirals.",

Based on diagnosis codes, we identified an additional 20 individuals \u226560 years old in our community cohort who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of RSV but not enrolled in the vaccine effectiveness study. These patients were most likely admitted through the emergency department or subspecialty clinics where study recruitment did not occur.
