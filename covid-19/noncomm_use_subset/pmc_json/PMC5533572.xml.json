To verify this strategy, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as delivery vehicles have been developed and have shown several features that make them well suited for biomedical applications. Importantly, AuNPs can be readily conjugated with peptides through the gold-thiol (Au-S) bond by simply mixing AuNPs with peptides that contain cysteine, thus offering a highly flexible and customizable approach to provide a scaffold that can be used to fix proteins or peptides to form a certain spatial orientation.22,23",

CpG, a widely used soluble Th1-type adjuvant, is the ligand of TLR9 that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns on foreign pathogens. Carbopol, a water-like substance, lightly cross-linked polymer of acrylic acid, has become a widely used adjuvant. Freund\u2019s adjuvant, an oil-like substance, is the most commonly used adjuvant in animal experiments.40 We used these three representative adjuvants in the current study. As shown in Figure 6, AuNPs significantly increased the Cap-specific antibody levels in the no-adjuvant and CpG groups, while there was almost no effect in the Carbopol and Freund\u2019s adjuvant groups (Figure 6A). We used the purified inactivated virus as fixative to detect PCV2-specific antibody levels. These antibodies bind to the outer surface of the virus. AuNPs significantly improved the PCV2-specific antibody levels with or without adjuvants, indicating that the addition of AuNPs resulted in more antibodies directed against the viral surface (Figure 6B).",

Therefore, there was no significant difference in the levels of IgG between the Cap and Cap-AuNP groups when using Carbopol and Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Figure 6A). High levels of antibody against PCV2 require epitopes on the surface of PCV2 to be fully recognized by APCs. Cap protein that binds to the surface of AuNPs can be efficiently recognized, swallowed, processed, and presented by APCs and plays a central role in activating immune response. Therefore, there was significant difference in the level of IgG against PCV2 between the Cap group and the Cap-AuNPs group when using Carbopol and Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Figure 6B). Our previous experiments (data not shown) have confirmed that CpG weakly promoted the levels of anti-Cap and PCV2 IgG. Moreover, CpG had a synergistic effect with AuNPs and markedly enlarged immune effect. However, AuNPs played a key role rather than CpG. Similar results have been found by Tao et al.36 Thus, when CpG was used as adjuvant, there was a significant difference between the Cap and Cap-AuNPs groups for IgG against Cap and PCV2 (Figure 6A and B).",

Interestingly, PCV2-specific and NA levels in lyophilized group were markedly higher than in non-lyophilized group (Figure 7B and D). The ratio of IgG against Cap (169\u2013180)/IgG against PCV2 in lyophilized group was obviously lower than in non-lyophilized group (Figure 7C). These data suggested that the slight reduction of Cap-specific antibody did not affect NA and the stability of Cap-AuNPs conjugation was likely enhanced following lyophilization. Cap protein spatial orientation is more stable, thus offering an advantage in transportation and long-term preservation.41 Furthermore, these data confirmed that AuNPs promoted NA mainly due to the reasonable display of neutralizing epitopes.",

As shown in Figure 8B and C, Cap-AuNPs induced significantly high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 production than Cap or AuNPs. IFN-\u03b3, Th1-biased cytokine, can promote the proliferation and differentiation of T cells, stimulate the secretion of IgG2a and IgG2b, activate macrophages, and enhance the cytotoxic effect of NK cells, conferring protection against viral infection. As shown in Figure 8D, Cap-AuNPs resulted in markedly higher level of IFN-\u03b3 than either the Cap or AuNPs. Interestingly, AuNPs induced a higher level of IFN-\u03b3 than Cap. We speculate that the increase in IFN-\u03b3 secretion may be due to the initial interaction of AuNPs with NK cells after AuNPs were injected into mice.42 In addition, it is likely that Cap protein mainly induced Th2 cell immunity and inhibited the secretion of Th1-based cytokines.43",

Each AuNP was capable of displaying 6-fold the amount of Cap protein than PCV2, resulting in a higher degree of BCR cross-linking. The second and more important point, AuNPs directionally presented multiple neutralizing epitopes; thus, B cells simultaneously recognized more neutralizing epitopes, resulting in rapid proliferation of B-cell clones, which specifically target the neutralizing epitopes. Meanwhile AuNPs shielded the immunodominant epitope Cap (169\u2013180), effectively reducing the antibody against this epitope, which plays a negative role in the production of NA.",

Furthermore, phosphorylation sites on proteins have a high affinity for aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles and tag polypeptides on antigens or domains on fusion-expressing antigens can be linked to nanoparticles, for example, poly-histidine tags can bind to various divalent metal cations and chitosan-binding domain can bind to chitosan nanoparticles.

Interestingly, ferritin forms a nearly spherical particle composed of 24 subunits. HA was exposed on the outer surface of ferritin, mimicked its spatial position on the influenza H1N1 virus, and elicited broad NA against influenza virus.47 The fusion of the amino-terminus and carboxyl-terminus of the target antigen with the protein nanoparticles confines the spatial conformation of the antigen and thus it may be unfavorable to randomly select a connection point and the orientationally display of the antigen.48,49 Furthermore, a protein carrier is immunogenic, which is disadvantageous for the development of similar vaccines.

The basic principle of designing such nanovaccines is to efficiently orient and repetitively display the neutralizing epitopes. First, identifying neutralizing epitopes depends on structural biology technology. Second, based on the antigenic structure, designing a site or domain which can adsorbe or conjugate to nanoparticles on the oppo site surface of a neutralizing epitope is ideal. If possible, naturally occurring sites can be utilized, such as the unique thiol groups in this study. This takes into account that most neutralizing epitopes are formed from residues that are discontinuous in the primary amino acid sequence or buried by other residues; thus, there may be a need to redesign artificial scaffolds and display the neutralizing epitope on the surface of scaffold.46,49 Third, to synthesize nanoparticles that can efficiently bind to antigen or neutralizing epitope artificial scaffolds at a certain point, nanoparticles may need to be chemically modified. Antigen or artificial scaffolds can combine with biomaterials and then form nanoparticles.

We conjugated Cap to AuNPs by the Au\u2013thiol interaction, which was confirmed by FTIR, resulting in the immunodominant epitopes being obscured while fully exposing the neutralizing epitopes on the outer surface. AuNPs promoted phagocytosis of Cap protein by APCs without inducing inflammatory cytokine secretion, enhanced humoral and cellular immunity, and balanced Th1 and Th2 type cellular immunity.
