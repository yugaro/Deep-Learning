Some of these cause endemic disease in regions of the globe, where they are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs and transmitted to man either by direct or indirect contact. For most of the emerging pathogens there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the time and investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti\u2010microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro\u2010organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease.",

Although labelled \u2018emerging\u2019, most of these pathogens are not new and have either been quiescent in the environment until the conditions are opportune to emerge or have evolved from a parent organism to adapt to the prevailing conditions. Thus, there is an intricate relationship between the environment, the climate, wildlife and human existence and lifestyle. The coronaviruses exemplify this point: the ancestral virus possibly existed approximately 10 000 years ago 1. Coronaviruses have a wide species range infecting birds, bats, chickens, pigs, dogs, cats and rodents 2. However, the first human coronavirus was described only in the 1960s 3, 4, and the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was discovered only in 2003 5, 6, 7, while that causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) first emerged in 2012 8. It is likely that warm\u2010blooded flying birds and bats have co\u2010evolved with the coronaviruses to aid dissemination 9. For example, SARS is thought to have first infected Old World bats, then spreading to horseshoe bats 10, civets and finally to man 11. In the 2003 outbreak of SARS in China and adjacent countries, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the virus spread from bats to humans, possibly through the intermediary civet species. Neither bats or civets showed any clinical signs of infection, and it is thought that bats are the main zoonotic reservoirs for the virus 12.",

            "text": "Globally, there are many regions of endemic disease which are maintained by reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens in the local wild animal species. These pathogens comprise viral, bacterial and rickettsial species and some have complex lifecycles, infecting an environmental (e.g. standing water) or animal reservoir and then being transmitted either by direct contact with man or indirectly, via an insect (e.g. mosquito) or mammalian (e.g. bat, civet, camel) vector, to man, from which they may be spread by human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. (Fig. 1). An example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito\u2010transmitted Plasmodium falciparum, causing malaria in many tropical regions. Malaria causes significant morbidity and co\u2010morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. Due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. The most advanced candidate is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine 18, which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation 19. Despite the availability of approved vaccines 20, 21, typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. Both infections are caused by bacteria (Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholera, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, TB is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions 22. Although the BCG vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use 23, 24 with 60\u201380% reported in the United Kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. The emergence of multi\u2010drug\u2010resistant TB (MDR TB) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important 25. Examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in Table 3. In particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) in Saudi Arabia and the Eastern Mediterranean countries; and by the Lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in West African countries and caused a serious outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria in 2018 26; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide 27, the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub\u2010Saharan Africa 28; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean 29. Interestingly, the same mosquito (Aedes aegypti) which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses 30. Chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in Africa, Asia, India and South America and with occasional cases in Europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease 31. Zika virus emerged in Brazil in 2015 32, although it was first detected in monkeys in Uganda as early as 1947 33, and the first documented human case occurred in Nigeria in 1954 34. The large Brazilian outbreak of Zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported 35. Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever 36.",

Bubonic plague is endemic in regions such as Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), India and China 37, 38, 39. Over thousands of years, Y. pestis has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea\u2010transmitted bacterium 40. It is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea\u2010bite to cause bubonic plague 41 (Fig. 2). If not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. In turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. Each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the Southwestern United States, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s 42. As well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread Y. pestis to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals 43) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. In endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. The plague outbreak in Madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8\u00b79% fatality rate) 44. This outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.",

In the United Kingdom, and subsequent to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, vaccine networks for human and veterinary vaccines have formed to prioritize vaccine efforts in these respective contexts 61, while the Department of Health, together with Innovate UK, has supported R&D of vaccine candidates for the prioritized pathogens 62. As a result of these global initiatives, a number of candidate vaccines are being developed for emerging bacterial and viral pathogens, examples of which, although by no means exhaustive, are cited here 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74.

In the PEP and PET contexts, the benefit of vaccination vastly outweighs the risk of disease (i.e. the risk : benefit ratio is low), while in the prophylactic context the risk : benefit ratio may be greater than, or equal to, 1\u00b70). For infections with short incubation times, e.g. less than 72 h, as for pneumonic plague, PEP or PET vaccination may only be useful if administered under antibiotic cover. In the United States, once a vaccine candidate has been thoroughly tested for safety in non\u2010clinical models, and in an escalating\u2010dose, statistically powered, Phase I design in the clinic, from then on it may be possible to pursue approval for an EUA, rather than pursue the full\u2010length pathway to biological licensing authorization (BLA).

As this is the first time the candidate is being used in man, the Phase I trial is typically small and cautious. If a range of dose\u2010levels is being tested, it may be necessary to dose a sentinel group of single subjects from each arm of the study to assess safety through week 1 of immunization and starting at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level. The data from the sentinel group would be reviewed before proceeding with the main study. Then the first cohort would be dosed at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level, and so on. Volunteers will be closely monitored for adverse effects in the clinic at each dosing time\u2010point and will typically maintain a diary at home to record any symptoms arising between time\u2010points. An independent safety monitoring panel, including medically qualified personnel, will be required to monitor the reporting of adverse effects. Volunteers may also be blood\u2010sampled to assess vaccine immunogenicity from baseline and serial samples, and depending on vaccine type may be required to supply additional samples which can be collected non\u2010invasively, e.g. saliva/stool samples.

A Phase III field trial of vaccine efficacy may be feasible in the event of an anticipated seasonal outbreak, in which case vaccination could be given prophylactically and well in advance. As long as effective biosurveillance programmes are in place to instigate a rapid response to new infections in an unvaccinated placebo cohort, the latter group may be included in a prophylactic efficacy trial. Conversely, reactive mode vaccination in the context of an actual outbreak is likely to be more complicated, as it would be unethical to omit anyone at risk of infection from the vaccination programme. Hence, sufficient safety data on the candidate vaccine would be required in case of need to administer it to pregnant/nursing mothers, children and elderly people as well as to the general adult population. Additionally, it may be necessary to administer an adjunct to the vaccine, such as an appropriate antibiotic, to both cohorts (vaccinated and placebo). Whatever the context, careful consideration of the trial design needs to be made and approved by the regulators to achieve adequate statistical powering and to determine the need to provide supplementary antimicrobial therapy, and also the need for a placebo cohort.",
