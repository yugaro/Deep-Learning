Infections range from relatively mild presentations (eg, cough, sore throat) to severe lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pneumonia).

As the physicians are often volunteers, there can be bias in the geographic distribution, leading to clustering of sampling in certain areas and not others. This can lead to inaccuracies as predominant circulating influenza strains vary geographically.7 11 Immunisation information is commonly self-reported, potentially leading to recall and social desirability biases12; volunteer physicians may be more likely to have strong views on influenza immunisation, potentially making it more difficult for the patient to admit to not being immunised. Finally, as these studies are labour-intensive for clinic staff, physician recruitment is often low, resulting in small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals (CI). Estimates are, therefore, typically available after the peak of the influenza season, decreasing their usefulness for public health messaging and resource and operational planning.6\u20138 11\n",
