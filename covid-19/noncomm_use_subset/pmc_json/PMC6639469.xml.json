            "text": "The renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart disease and heart failure in dogs.1, 2, 3, 4 The traditional concept of the RAAS is as follows: cardiac disease, as well as treatments for cardiac disease, such as diuretics, decrease perfusion of the kidney, activating release of renin, which converts angiotensinogen to the 10\u2010amino acid peptide, angiotensin I (AT1[1\u201010]). Subsequently, the dipeptidyl\u2010carboxypeptidase, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE), cleaves 2 amino acids from the C\u2010terminus of AT1(1\u201010) to form the octapeptide, angiotensin II (AT2[1\u20108]). Angiotensin II acts primarily through angiotensin receptor type 1 and causes potent vasoconstriction, sodium and water conservation, aldosterone release, and myocardial remodeling.5 Thus, the traditional view of the RAAS is that of a linear and maladaptive pathological system that is overactive during heart failure and often suppressed using ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and aldosterone antagonists. This understanding changed with the discovery of a homologue of ACE, called angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).6, 7 Like ACE, ACE2 is a membrane\u2010bound zinc metalloproteinase; the catalytic site of which is capable of binding various angiotensin peptides (APs), such as AT2(1\u20108). However, ACE2 is a mono\u2010carboxypeptidase and it removes only a single amino acid from the C\u2010terminus of its catalytic substrate.8, 9 For example, ACE2 acts on AT1(1\u201010) and AT2(1\u20108) to produce a 9\u2010amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1\u20109 (Ang1\u20109) and a 7\u2010amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1\u20107 (Ang1\u20107), respectively.10 Despite being different by only 1 amino acid, the biological effects of Ang1\u20109 and Ang1\u20107 are opposite of those associated with AT2(1\u20108). Specifically, Ang1\u20109 and Ang1\u20107 are vasodilatory, natriuretic, diuretic, antifibrotic, and antiremodeling.9 These beneficial APs mediate the majority of their effects by binding to angiotensin receptor type 2 or an endogenous orphan Mas receptor (MasR), as opposed to binding to ATR1.11, 12 It is now known9, 13 that the ACE2 system provides an endogenous counterbalance to ACE and that an expanded view of the RAAS involves many different APs with structures differing by 1 to 5 amino acids. Thus, RAAS is considerably more complex than those traditionally viewed, and this discovery has uncovered a broad new set of molecules to explore, understand, and potentially modify in subjects with heart disease.",

To the best of our knowledge, studies of ACE2 in dogs with naturally occurring heart disease are lacking. We sought to detect and describe the location of ACE2 immunoreactivity in the kidney and left ventricular (LV) myocardium to quantify the activity of plasma, kidney, and LV myocardial ACE2, to determine the equilibrium concentrations of 10 different circulating APs, and to determine the effect of recombinant human ACE2 on the relative amounts of beneficial versus maladaptive APs. Our hypotheses were that the evidence of ACE2 could be found in tissues and plasma of dogs, that equilibrium concentrations of RAAS APs would differ in dogs with heart disease versus healthy dogs, and recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) can alter relative concentrations of APs.",

Criteria for DMVD included a left apical systolic murmur and echocardiographic evidence of thickened or prolapsing mitral valve leaflets and mitral regurgitation. Echocardiographic examinations (iE33, Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) recorded left ventricular internal dimension at end diastole (LVIDdN) and end\u2010systole (LVIDsN) from the 2\u2010dimensional (2D) right short axis view, which were then normalized to body weight using previously reported formulas.14 The left atrium\u2010to\u2010aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) was calculated using measurements from the 2D right short axis.15 Echocardiographic values were the average value of 3 measured beats. Healthy dogs that primarily were owned by staff and employees of the veterinary hospital were recruited as a control group and included dogs without a heart murmur or clinical signs suggestive of heart disease. Control dogs weighing >25 kg had a 2D echocardiogram performed to exclude the potential for occult dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Venipuncture was performed, and lithium heparinized plasma samples were obtained. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until batch analysis. Activity of ACE2 in heparinized plasma was measured using a fluorometric assay kit (#K897\u2010100, Biovision Inc, Milpitas, California). The ACE2 activity results are reported in milliunits per mg protein (mU/mg). The assay has a lower detection limit of 0.4 mU.

Criteria for diagnosis of DMVD were the same as those for dogs recruited for study of plasma ACE2 activity assay. Criteria for diagnosis of DCM were presence of systolic dysfunction and LV eccentric hypertrophy on echocardiography defined as LVIDsN and LVIDdN above the normal reference range in the absence of an identifiable cardiac cause. A previously reported clinical staging system for dogs with DMVD16 was modified for use in all dogs. Specifically, dogs were segregated into those with preclinical (asymptomatic) heart disease (stage B) and those with current or historical signs of CHF (stage C) or those with signs of CHF refractory to standard PO treatment with furosemide, ACEI, positive inotropes, and spironolactone, and therefore in need of additional diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide or torsemide (stage D). Further classification of dogs in stage B occurred depending on the absence (stage B1) or presence (stage B2) of heart enlargement on echocardiography defined as LVIDdN \u2265 1.7 and LA:Ao \u2265 1.6.17 Venipuncture, blood collection, and storage were performed as previously described. Healthy dogs were recruited as described above. To provide more uniformity to the equilibrium concentrations results in stages B and C, and to best reflect clinical practice at our institution, dogs in stage B were prohibited from receiving ACEI, whereas all dogs in stage C were required to receive ACEI. The plasma equilibrium concentration of 10 different RAAS APs, including AT1(1\u201010), AT2(1\u20108), Ang1\u20109, Ang1\u20107, angiotensin 1\u20105 (Ang1\u20105), angiotensin 2\u201010 (Ang2\u201010), angiotensin III (AT3[2\u20108]), angiotensin IV (AT4[3\u20108]), angiotensin 2\u20107 (Ang2\u20107), and angiotensin 3\u20107 (Ang3\u20107), were quantified by liquid chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry/mass spectroscopy (LC\u2010MS/MS) performed at a commercial laboratory (Attoquant Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) using previously validated and described methods.18, 19 Testing samples from humans has shown similar qualitative outcomes when comparing the quantification of circulating and equilibrium AP concentrations.18, 19 Two additional calculations were performed using equilibrium AP concentrations. The first calculation was a surrogate measure of plasma renin activity (PRAsurr) calculated as the sum of the AT1(1\u201010) and AT2(1\u20108) concentrations and the second a surrogate measure of ACE activity (ACEsurr) calculated as the ratio of AT2(1\u20108) to AT1(1\u201010).20 To explore the effect of exogenous ACE2 on the relative concentrations of selected RAAS APs, plasma samples from stage B2 and stage C dogs also were incubated with 5 \u03bcg/mL of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota) at 37\u00b0C, followed by measurement of equilibrium concentrations of AT1(1\u201010), AT2(1\u20108), Ang1\u20109, Ang1\u20107, and Ang1\u20105.

Differences in concentrations across and between groups were detected for a number of APs, including AT1(1\u201010), Ang1\u20107, Ang1\u20109, Ang2\u201010, Ang2\u20107, and Ang3\u20107 (Table 3). In general, the concentration of each of these APs was highest in dogs in stage C, intermediate in stage B1 or B2, and lowest in healthy dogs (Figure 4). A global overview of the expanded RAAS identified large differences in the overall activation and relative amounts of APs across patient groups (Figure 5). Of note, median AT1(1\u201010) was >43 and 17 times higher in stage C than healthy and stage B2 dogs, respectively. Median Ang1\u20107 in stage C was > 43 and 11 times higher than in healthy and stage B2 dogs, respectively, and median Ang1\u20109 in stage C was >5 times higher than in both healthy and stage B1 or B2 dogs. No differences across groups were found for AT2(1\u20108), AT3(2\u20108), AT4(3\u20108), or Ang1\u20105. A number of APs, including AT1(1\u201010), Ang1\u20109, and Ang2\u201010, had significant positive and modest correlation to LVIDdN and LA:Ao in affected dogs (see Supporting Information). The median surrogate plasma renin activity (PRAsurr) was significantly different across patient groups (Figure 6), and the median PRAsurr in stage C was approximately 27 and 12 times higher than that in healthy dogs or dogs in stage B2, respectively (Table 3). The median ACEsurr also was significantly different across patient groups (Figure 6). The median ACEsurr in stage C was 16 to 20 times lower than that in healthy dogs or dogs in stages B1 or B2 (Table 3). The addition of rhACE2 to plasma samples from 6 dogs in stage B2 and 7 dogs in stage C significantly increased paired median equilibrium concentrations of several APs while decreasing the concentration of others (Figure 7 and Supporting Information). Specifically, concentrations of AT1(1\u201010) decreased in stage B2 dogs from 196.8 pg/mL (158.8\u2010292.8) to 75.4 pg/mL (48.9\u2010142.6; P = .03) and from 3373 pg/mL (2497\u20104318) to 1187 pg/mL (492.8\u20102201; P = .02) in dogs in stage C. Concentration of AT2(1\u20108) in stage B2 dogs decreased from 80.0 pg/mL (71.1\u2010125.1) to 1.6 pg/mL (0.50\u20103.38; P = .03) and from 53.4 pg/mL (28.6\u2010226.4) to 2.4 pg/mL (0.50\u20105.8; P = .02) in dogs in stage C. Concentration of Ang1\u20109 increased in stage B2 dogs from 1.8 pg/mL (1.8\u20101.8) to 61.6 pg/mL (34.5\u201089.0; P = .03) and from 10.3 pg/mL (4.4\u201037.2) to 2431 pg/mL (1355\u20103037; P = .02) in dogs in stage C. Concentration of Ang1\u20107 in stage B2 dogs increased from 37.8 pg/mL (28.3\u201062.5) to 131.5 pg/mL (80.9\u2010202.6; P = .03) and from 468.7 pg/mL (238.8\u20101143) to 1004 pg/mL (373.7\u20102594; P = .16) in dogs in stage C. Concentration of Ang1\u20105 in stage B2 dogs increased from 22.0 pg/mL (19.7\u201039.8) to 52.8 pg/mL (45.8\u2010113; P = .03) and from 25.7 pg/mL (3.4\u201093.4) to 67.7 pg/mL (11.9\u2010254.2; P = .02) in dogs in stage C. Assays for RAAS AP equilibrium analysis and RAAS AP equilibrium analysis after incubation with rhACE2 were performed on average 30 days (range, 11\u201045) and 50 days (range, 30\u201064) after date of sample collection, respectively.",

            "text": "The discovery of ACE2 and its related APs (Figure 8) is a subject of intense study in humans with heart disease,23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and to our knowledge, our study is the first to provide an expanded view of RAAS in dogs with heart disease. Our results identify ACE2 immunolabeling and activity in canine LV myocardium. Previous reports in rats28 and humans6, 28 indicated similar findings, suggesting an important role for ACE2 in cardiac function. Strong immunolabeling and a high degree of ACE2 activity also was found in the renal tubular epithelium, consistent with previous studies in dogs,29 mice,30 and humans.6, 7 Our results indicate that the ACE2 system is regulated differently in dogs with heart disease as compared to healthy dogs. First, plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in dogs with CHF, similar to previous reports in human patients with heart disease. In 1 such study,31 serum ACE2 activity was significantly increased secondary to ischemic and nonischemic heart disease and was independent of medications or comorbidities. In other studies,32, 33, 34 serum ACE2 activity was positively correlated with echocardiographic heart size, negatively correlated with heart function, and was independently associated with important clinical events, including death or hospitalization. The role of circulating or soluble ACE2, as opposed to tissue\u2010bound ACE2, is not fully understood. As previously mentioned, ACE2 is an integral membrane\u2010bound protein and the balance of tissue versus circulating ACE2 is mediated by membrane metalloproteinases that cleave portions of the cell membrane, which then are released into the surrounding extracellular space.33, 35, 36 The resultant ectosomes contain ACE2 as well as the immediate surrounding extracellular environment and enter the circulation or urine. This process is described as ectodomain shedding.36, 37 Previous studies35 indicate that shedding of ACE2 is more frequent than shedding of ACE, which also is highly membrane bound, and that AT2(1\u20108), tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1\u03b2, and disintegrin metalloproteases are potent stimuli for ACE2 shedding in mice and humans.37, 38, 39 Thus, the increase in circulating ACE2 might represent pathological displacement of ACE2 from its normal tissue membrane location, mediated in part by a feedback loop in which various substances decrease the activity of its negative regulator.39 As a result, circulating ACE2, which is removed from its normal location and ideal environment, is hypothesized to represent wasted or ineffective ACE2.31, 39 In our study, activity of circulating ACE2 normalized to protein amount was approximately 100\u2010fold less than activity of kidney ACE2, which supports this hypothesis. Our results, however, also indicated that both the kidney and LV ACE2 activity were not significantly different in dogs with CHF as compared to healthy dogs, suggesting that ACE2 shedding was not an important factor in the total extent of tissue\u2010bound ACE2 activity, but a loss of tissue ACE2 into the circulation would tend to decrease the overall compensatory potential of ACE2.31, 33, 39 Further elucidation of a seemingly complex relationship between circulating and tissue ACE2 is needed.",

            "text": "A second important finding of our study is the relationships and relative concentrations of various APs within the expanded RAAS, which provides insight into the pathophysiology of disease. Beginning at the first portion of RAAS (Figure 8), our results indicate that heart disease in the dog is associated with increased plasma renin activity. This finding is consistent with previous reports in dogs1, 40 and leads to higher concentrations of AT1(1\u201010). In stages B1 and B2, downstream activation of RAAS and generation of AT2(1\u20108) appears only mild, which also is consistent with a previous study of neurohormonal activation in dogs.2 Specifically, our data indicate higher concentrations of AT1(1\u201010) and AT2(1\u20108) in stages B1 and B2 as compared to healthy dogs, but these changes failed to reach statistical significance. Yet, once CHF develops (ie, stage C), PRA and Ang1(1\u201010) are greatly increased and serve as potential substrate for generation of downstream APs, such as AT2(1\u20108) (Figure 5). In our study, all dogs in stage C were receiving ACEI, which prevented conversion of AT1(1\u201010) into large amounts of AT2(1\u20108). Thus, concentrations of AT2(1\u20108) were not significantly different in stage C as compared to other patient groups. Instead, our results indicated that in dogs with CHF, AT1(1\u201010) presumably was cleaved by the proteases aminopeptidase (AmP), ACE2, and neutral endopeptidase into significantly higher concentrations of Ang2\u201010, Ang1\u20109, and Ang1\u20107, respectively.12 The actions of these APs, and in particular Ang1\u20109 and Ang1\u20107, have been studied in a variety of species, including humans, dogs, and rats, and include vasodilatation, natriuresis, activation of nitric oxide, antagonism of ATR1, protection against ischemia and reperfusion injury, simulation of natriuretic peptide release, and improvement in glycolysis and high energy phosphate production.11, 12, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 Thus, the reported benefits48, 49 of ACEI in dogs with CHF might be a result of increased concentrations and salutary actions of Ang1\u20109 and Ang1\u20107, as well as inhibition of AT2(1\u20108) formation. Our findings within an expanded RAAS indicate the existence of closely related but biologically distinct groups of APs, 1 of which promotes the CHF phenotype while the other acts as a counterbalance working to shift the balance within RAAS back toward the beneficial APs.",

The exact biologic actions of certain APs are incompletely understood and are predicted based on extension from studies in animal models. Previous studies in mice50, 51 indicated that AT3(2\u20108) binds to ATR1, thereby eliciting effects similar to AT2(1\u20108). Within the central nervous system, AT3(2\u20108) is the final effector molecule that mediates effects of AT2(1\u20108), such as release of vasopressin from the pituitary gland.50 In contrast, despite differing from AT3(2\u20108) by only a single amino acid, AT4(3\u20108) binds to MasR and a novel AT4(3\u20108) receptor, eliciting effects similar to Ang1\u20107, including prevention of apoptosis, vasodilatation, and anti\u2010remodeling (Figure 8).52, 53, 54 In our study, equilibrium concentrations of AT3(2\u20108) and AT4(3\u20108) in dogs with heart disease were not significantly different from those of healthy dogs. The reason for this finding in dogs with preclinical disease might stem from the relatively low overall activity of RAAS whereas in dogs with severe disease and CHF, formation of AT3(2\u20108) from its precursor, Ang2\u201010, is primarily mediated by ACE and would have been blocked by the presence of ACEI. Subsequently, low amounts of AT3(2\u20108) then would limit downstream formation of AT4(3\u20108; Figure 8). Relatively little is known about other APs in the expanded RAAS. A previous study47 reported that Ang2\u201010 is vasodilatory and antiproliferative whereas another study55 reported that Ang2\u201010 was vasoconstrictive, but likely only after conversion to AT3(2\u20108). As for the remaining APs, in humans, Ang(2\u20107) induces mild vasoconstriction,56 Ang(3\u20107) is thought to be a centrally acting vasoconstrictor,57 and Ang1\u20105 binds MasR and causes vasodilatation and increased natriuretic peptide release.58 Thus, results of RAAS AP equilibrium analysis in dogs with CHF receiving ACEI indicated an increase in beneficial APs including Ang1\u20109, Ang1\u20107, and Ang2\u201010; no change in beneficial APs including AT4(3\u20108) and Ang1\u20105; an increase in maladaptive APs, including Ang2\u20107 and Ang3\u20107; and no change in maladaptive APs including AT2(1\u20108) and AT3(2\u20108). These data offer insight into the pathophysiology of disease and suggest novel treatment approaches as discussed below.",

            "text": "A third important finding of our study is the ability to shift the balance of APs within the RAAS using rhACE2. The counter regulatory role of ACE2 on the maladaptive effects of ACE and AT2(1\u20108) make ACE2 and its related APs attractive targets for pharmacotherapy.23, 25, 26, 27, 45, 59, 60, 61 Treatment with exogenous ACE2 is particularly interesting in light of the fact that the affinity of ACE2 to cleave AT2(1\u20108) into beneficial Ang1\u20107 is 12\u2010fold greater than the affinity of ACE to cleave AT1(1\u201010) to AT2(1\u20108),62 suggesting that exogenous ACE2 or ACE2 activators would be capable of converting even large amounts of AT2(1\u20108). In our study, incubation of plasma samples with rhACE2 from dogs with stage B2 or stage C heart disease resulted in significantly higher equilibrium concentrations of beneficial APs, including Ang1\u20109, Ang1\u20107, and Ang1\u20105, while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of maladaptive APs, including AT1(1\u201010) and AT2(1\u20108). Previous studies18, 63 of rhACE2 involving human serum or healthy volunteers reported similar increases in beneficial APs and suppression of maladaptive APs, and have led to early trials64 in humans with pulmonary hypertension. Collectively, these data provide conceptual support of therapies targeting the ACE2 system. Our data also suggest that the methodology employed in our study, namely equilibrium analysis of APs, is a useful preclinical analytical tool.",

            "text": "Our study had a number of limitations. Larger studies are needed to confirm findings from the relatively small number of animals in our study. Plasma ACE2 activity was quantified only in dogs with CHF secondary to advanced DMVD and important differences might exist in dogs with early DMVD or in animals with other causes of CHF. The potential correlation among circulating ACE2 activity, duration of CHF and administration of medications, and clinical outcome requires longitudinal studies. The clinical implication of circulating ACE2 appears complex. For example, although previous observational studies32, 33, 34 determined that increased ACE2 activity was associated with poor outcome, in a study involving patients after intensive treatment for acute CHF,65 increased ACE2 activity over baseline was associated with improved survival. The number of samples obtained for kidney and LV myocardial ACE2 activity was small because of difficulty in procuring such samples, and future studies of larger populations might identify important differences. Evaluation of the expanded RAAS was performed using equilibrium analysis and the reported concentrations are higher than the actual circulating concentrations, but the 2 values are highly correlated,18 which preserve the ability to ascertain relative differences among APs. The expanded model of RAAS remains a simple representation of a highly complex pathophysiological network with many additional (both identified and unidentified) components and relationships. Regardless, the proposed RAAS model offers new insights and proof of concept for a novel treatment strategy. Dogs were receiving a variety of cardiac medications including diuretics and anti\u2010RAAS agents such as ACEI and spironolactone that might have influenced the results. Dogs in the RAAS AP equilibrium analysis included both dogs with DMVD and DCM, and important differences in the magnitude of RAAS AP concentrations might exist. Studies that specifically examine the effect of various treatments on RAAS are of interest. For example, a previous study (Ames MK, Potter BK, Hess A. Effect of loop diuretics on novel components of the renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system in healthy dogs [Abstract]. Proceedings of the 2018 ACVIM Forum, Seattle, WA, 2018) in dogs compared the relative extent of RAAS activation after administration of furosemide as compared to torsemide by analyzing the equilibrium concentrations of Ang1\u20107, Ang1\u20103, AT3(2\u20108), and AT4(3\u20108), whereas others18 have reported increased Ang1\u20109, Ang1\u20107, and Ang1\u20105 mediated by combined treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers and rhACE2 in serum samples of humans. Finally, healthy dogs weighing <25 kg were not required to undergo echocardiographic studies, but the incidence of asymptomatic DCM in this population of dogs likely was low.",
