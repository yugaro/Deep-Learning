            "text": "Clinical virology and virus discovery in the 20th century focused chiefly on the identification of viruses through microscopy, serology, and cell or animal infection studies (1). With the advent of nucleic acid amplification, a wide range of molecular approaches for virus detection became available: PCR (2), consensus PCR (cPCR) and multiplex PCR systems (3\u201310), differential display (11), representational difference analysis (12, 13), subtractive cloning (14), domain-specific differential display (15), cDNA cloning (16\u201318), cDNA immunoscreening (19, 20), microarrays (21, 22), and, most recently, high-throughput sequencing (HTS). HTS has enabled unbiased pathogen discovery and facilitated virome analyses that have enhanced our understanding of the origin, evolution, and ecology of known and novel viruses (1). However, HTS has not been widely implemented in clinical diagnostic laboratories largely due to operational complexity, cost, and insensitivity with respect to agent-specific PCR assays.",

Toward this end, oligonucleotides were selected to represent all viral taxa containing at least one virus known to infect vertebrates; virus families that include exclusively viruses infecting plants or insects were excluded (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Coding sequences were extracted from the EMBL Coding Domain Sequence database, clustered at 96% sequence identity, and used to select 100-mer oligonucleotides spaced by approximately 25 to 50 nucleotides (nt) along each sequence. To address sequence variation, oligonucleotide mutant or variant sequences were retained if sequences diverged by more than 90%. Where technical complexity in oligonucleotide synthesis was challenging due to melting temperature (Tm) or homopolymer repeats, probe sequences were refined by shortening and adjusting their start/stop positions. The final library comprised 1,993,176 oligonucleotides ranging in length from 50 to 100 nt and in Tm from 58.7\u00b0C to 101\u00b0C (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).",

We mapped the probe library against a database of 100 reference virus genome sequences representing double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA, positive and negative RNA, and circular, linear, and segmented viruses, using a minimum nucleotide identity of 90%. The probe library covered targeted genome sequences with probes spaced at <150-nt intervals (Fig. 1) but provided no coverage of noncoding regions (e.g., poliovirus 5\u2032 untranslated region [UTR]) (Fig. 1A). The highest probe coverage was evident in divergent genome regions (e.g., yellow fever virus E gene region; approximately position 1000 to 2500) (Fig. 1B). In silico analysis indicated that the VirCapSeq-VERT probe library included oligonucleotides that selectively hybridize to genomes of vertebrate viruses but not to those of bacteriophages or plant or fungal viruses.",

Extrapolated to clinical samples, these values correspond to a blood specimen containing approximately 1,200 copies/ml or a tissue specimen containing approximately 16,000 copies/mg, assuming 100% extraction yield (see Table S5 in the supplemental material). Even at the lowest level of virus input tested, 10 viral copies per 50 ng background NA, corresponding to approximately 100 copies/ml blood, VirCapSeq-VERT enabled recovery of 45 kb (29%) of HHV-1 and 0.75 kb (7%) of WNV genome sequence. We then tested human blood and serum samples (1 ml) spiked with live enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) virus stock.

However, concerns regarding sensitivity, especially in high-host-background settings, cumbersome and time-consuming sample processing, and cost pose hurdles that would need to be overcome in order to realize the potential of HTS. Unlike 16S rRNA of bacteria, viruses lack universally conserved markers and have plastic genomes that easily generate mutants, strains, and variants. Virus variants differing in sequence, even by a single point mutation, can vary in host range, transmissibility and pathogenicity (23, 24). Accordingly, an ideal viral diagnostic platform should enable sensitive multiplexed detection of all viruses and their variants. Nucleic acid capture with oligonucleotides has been used to enhance the efficiency of HTS for characterizing host (25, 26) or selected microbial (27, 28) targets at low scale. However, to our knowledge, VirCapSeq-VERT is the first example wherein a positive selection method for HTS has been employed for comprehensive, sensitive application in microbial diagnostics and whole virome analysis.",

The VirCap probe library (4.5 \u03bcl) was added and hybridized at 47\u00b0C for 12 h in a standard PCR thermocycler. SeqCap Pure capture beads (Roche/NimbleGen) were washed twice, mixed with the hybridization mix, and kept at 47\u00b0C for 45 min with vortexing for 10 s every 10 to 15 min. The streptavidin capture beads complexed with biotinylated VirCapSeq-VERT probes were trapped (DynaMag-2 magnet; Thermo, Fisher) and washed once at 47\u00b0C and then twice more at room temperature with wash buffers of increasing stringency. Finally, beads were suspended in 50 \u00b5l water and directly subjected to posthybridization PCR (SeqCap EZ accessory kit V2; Roche/NimbleGen). The PCR products were purified (Agencourt Ampure DNA purification beads; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and quantitated by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) for Illumina sequencing.",

            "text": "Sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) resulted in an average of 210 million reads per lane. Samples were demultiplexed using Illumina software, and FastQ files were generated. Demultiplexed and Q30-filtered FastQ files were mapped against reference genomes from GenBank with Bowtie2 mapper 2.0.6 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net). SAMtools (v 0.1.19) (33) were used to generate the consensus genomes and coverage statistics. Integrative Genomics Viewer (v 2/3/55) (34) was used to generate coverage plots. Host background levels were determined from Bowtie2 mappings against the host genomes downloaded from the NCBI. Sequencing data obtained from the unknown samples was preprocessed using PRINSEQ (v 0.20.2) (35) software, and filtered reads were aligned against the host reference databases to remove the host background. The resulting reads were de novo assembled using MIRA (v 4.0) (36) or SOAPdenovo2 (v 2.04) (37) assemblers, and contigs and unique singletons were subjected to homology search using MegaBlast against the GenBank nucleotide database; sequences that showed poor or no homology at the nucleotide level were screened by BLASTX against the viral GenBank protein database. Viral sequences from BLASTX analysis were subjected to another round of BLASTX homology search against the entire GenBank protein database to correct for biased E values and taxonomic misassignments. Based on the contigs identified for different viral strains, GenBank sequences were downloaded and used for mapping the whole data set to recover partial or complete genomes. Viral read numbers were obtained from counting the number of reads mapping to contig sequences and unassembled singletons, and percentages were calculated in relation to the total read number obtained. Percentages were converted into heatmaps using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV v4.9) (38).",
