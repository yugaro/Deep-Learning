This result was similar to a study conducted in Kuwait, which failed to detect any HCoV-NL63 infections in 735 hospitalized patients, while higher numbers were reported for other neighboring countries, such as Turkey (2.9%) and Saudi Arabia (3.7%).12,13,31 The current study\u2019s single HCoV-NL63-positive patient was less than 8 months old, confirming that HCoV-NL63 is more frequently identified in ARIs in younger children.38 Despite this low detection rate for HCoVs, the viruses appear to be circulating in this geographic region because a large proportion of serum samples taken from the study group was confirmed to be seropositive for HCoV-NL63 (69%) and HCoV-229E (65.5%) as determined by an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay\u2013based assay using recombinant N protein as antigen (data not shown). It is tempting to speculate that common HCoVs (in contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and other respiratory viruses) cause less severe ARIs that only in very few cases require hospitalization. More studies (including virological studies of ARIs in pediatric outpatient departments) are required to explore this possibility.",

This is consistent with previous studies, showing a low-level circulation of respiratory viruses during the dry season. Seasonality of respiratory virus infections is known to vary due to temperature and humidity variations.37,41 The study area has 4 distinct seasons, with lowest temperatures usually occurring in January (average 8\u00b0C). From February to May, the average temperature varies between 12\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C with increasing rainfall. After April, the weather turns hot (average 40\u00b0C) and remains dry during the summer months.42 In our study, the vast majority of ARI in children occurred between November and March, demonstrating a late autumn to early spring seasonality of viral respiratory infections in children in this geographic region.",

HEV/HRV, RSV, and hMPV were the most frequent pathogens, accounting for more than two thirds of the ARIs cases.
