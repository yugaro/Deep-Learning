            "text": "Plantar fascia (PF) is a flat band of ligament-like tissue that connects one\u2019s heel bone to toes. This tissue helps to sustain body weight and is subject to large mechanical loads during daily activities. For example, during walking and running, PF could be subjected to mechanical loads that are in several folds to the body weight.1\u20134 Plantar fasciitis, or PF inflammation, is one of the most common causes of heel pain that affects more than 3 million people in the United States alone every year.5 It accounts for 11% to 15% of the foot symptoms requiring professional care among adults.6\u20139 Despite the high prevalence of plantar fasciitis, no effective treatment is currently available in clinics10 because its pathogenesis is largely unknown.10 Mechanical overload is considered to be a major factor causing plantar fasciitis presumably due to repetitive microtrauma; other factors, such as anatomical irregularity of the foot and environmental conditions (e.g., activities and footwear), also contribute to the pathology.11\u201313 Although a repair process is initiated, continued microtrauma to the junctional site between PF and heel bone causes chronic inflammation of the fascia.14,15 Histological findings indicate that chronic plantar fasciitis also involves degenerative changes in PF tissue, as evidenced by the presence of mucoid substance and bone marrow vascular ectasia.10 Disorganized and degenerating collagen fibers, angiofibroblastic hyperplasia, and calcification are the major histopathological findings in plantar fasciitis.16",

However, while PF has been extensively studied biomechanically, little has been done at the structural and cellular levels.28",

We identified two distinct types of tissues in human PF, namely, sheath and core, which are structurally dissimilar in terms of collagen organization, collagen types, and presence of blood vessels. In addition, these two tissue types contain distinct stem cells that exhibit differential biological properties such as clonogenicity, multi-differentiation and proliferation potential, and expression of stem cell markers (octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4), stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4), and nucleostemin (NS)). The mechanobiological response of these two populations of PF stem cells also differs in terms of expression of collagen I and IV, non-ligament-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx-2), collagen II), inflammatory genes (cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)), as well as the production of inflammatory agents (PGE2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and matrix degradative enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)).",

Finally, the slides were washed again, counterstained with H33342 nuclear stain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and photographed with fluorescence microscope (Nikon eclipse, TE2000-U). The staining results were analyzed by semi-quantification. Briefly, three tissue sections were used for testing each marker; the areas of positive staining were identified manually and computed using SPOT IMAGING Software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA).

Moderate mechanical stretching (MMS) at 4% did not enhance collagen I expression in PF-S cells but did increase it significantly in PF-C cells (Figure 7(a)), whereas collagen IV expression was significantly enhanced in PF-S cells but not in PF-C cells (Figure 7(b)). The gene expression of CD105 (angiogenesis marker) did not change at 4% stretching in both PF-S and PF-C cells (Figure 7(c)); however, intensive mechanical stretching (IMS) at 8% increased the expression of collagen I in both PF-S and PF-C cells (Figure 7(a)), and collagen IV (Figure 7(b)) and CD105 (Figure 7(c)) in PF-S cells only. These results indicate that PF-S and PF-C cells respond to mechanical loading conditions differentially, at least in terms of the expression of collagen I and IV, and CD105 genes.",

While previous studies have focused on the gross histological anatomy and biomechanics of PF, hardly any histological and biological studies have been done on PF tissue as yet. This study characterized human PF tissue in detail at histological, cellular, and mechanobiological levels. Our findings show that PF tissue consists of two distinct sheath and core tissues with differential structural and compositional properties. Stem cells isolated from sheath and core tissues also exhibit differential properties at biological and mechanobiological levels. The sheath tissue is a loose array of random, thin collagen fibers with blood vessels; however, the core tissue is a much denser form of thick collagen fibers organized in a very precise order providing PF tissue with a greater tensile strength needed to sustain large mechanical loads during daily and sports activities. Moreover, the richly vascularized sheath (Figure 2) may provide nutrients needed for the homeostasis of the poorly vascularized core tissue as well as play a role in transporting rapidly proliferating stem cells (Figure 4) in the event of injury due to mechanical overloading.",

Moreover, PF-C cells maintain elongated shape in culture (Figure 4(b)), which is similar to the shape observed in original tissue (Figure 1), whereas PF-S cells are multi-shaped (Figure 4(a)) and associated with mesh-like structure of PF-S. The differential characteristics of the two types of stem cells, that is, PF-S cells are similar to vascular stem cells, whereas PF-C cells are more like connective tissue (ligament) cells, suggest that both types of stem cells play different roles in the development of chronic plantar fasciitis as well as healing of acutely injured PF tissue.

However, the exact magnitudes of in vivo loads on the PF tissue are not known. Therefore, the results from MMS and IMS loading of this study are meant to be \u201cqualitative\u201d in nature. We found moderate mechanical loading with 4% stretching to be beneficial for PF tissue by increasing the expression of collagen I and by enabling differentiation of core stem cells into ligament fibroblasts to maintain PF homeostasis. However, intensive mechanical loading at 8% stretching also induces gene expression specific for adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis (Figure 7(f)\u2013(h)), suggesting induction of aberrant differentiation in PF stem cells in vivo and possible degenerative changes in PF tissue. These results may explain previous histological finding that collagen necrosis, angiofibroblastic hyperplasia, chondroid metaplasia, and matrix calcification are present in surgical biopsy PF specimens.40 Furthermore, intensive mechanical loading also induces the expression of MMP genes (Figure 7(d) and (e)), increases COX-2 gene (Figure 8(a) and (b)) expression, and increases IL-6 and PGE2 (Figure 8(c) and (d)), whereas moderate mechanical loading does not. These findings suggest that intensive loading can induce detrimental effects in tissues by inducing matrix-degrading enzymes by elevated MMP gene expression, and enhancing cellular inflammatory response through increased COX-2 gene expression and increased inflammatory mediators (IL-6, PGE2). Taken together, these findings may suggest a direct mechanism by which mechanical overloading on PF tissue causes PF inflammation and degeneration, in addition to the aberrant differentiation of the sheath and core stem cells due to mechanical overloading.",

Intensive mechanical loading induced a much higher level of expression of CD105 and collagen IV in PF-S cells than PF-C cells. Elevated expression of CD105 suggests blood vessel development and neovascularization suggesting that mechanical overloading-induced injury to PF tissue may induce angiogenesis resulting in plantar fasciitis inflammation. Angiogenesis is suggested to be a leading candidate for chronic tendon pain.41 Moderate mechanical loading did not have such pronounced effects in the expression of CD105 in either sheath or core stem cells; therefore, angiogenesis may not occur at that loading condition. Enhanced expression of collagen IV by both moderate and intensive mechanical loading in the PF-S cells may mean that as a mechanical adaptive response, basement membrane may have thickened in the sheath. This prediction by this study should be examined in future clinical studies of plantar fasciitis.",

Our results indicated that human PF consists of two distinct types of tissues, sheath and core, that display dissimilar structural properties, with two stem cell populations derived from these PF tissues possessing different biological properties. These sheath and core stem cells also exhibit differential responses to mechanical loading conditions. In particular, mechanical overloading induced aberrant differentiation of the sheath and core tissue stem cells, and their inflammatory and catabolic responses, which may play a major role in the development of plantar fasciitis.",
