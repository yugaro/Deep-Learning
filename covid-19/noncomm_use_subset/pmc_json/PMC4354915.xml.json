            "text": "Fungal infections due to Conidiobolus spp. are rare in dogs and cats; however, it has been more frequently reported in humans and livestock [1,2]. Conidiobolomycosis is characterized as a chronic, granulomatous fungal disease of the nasopharynx [1]. On rare occasion disease can spread to other areas of the head and neck as well as disseminate throughout the body [5\u20137]. Geographically the disease is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical climates [1]. Affected individuals are usually immunocompetent with locally extensive disease, as dissemination is rare [1\u20134]. The majority of infections in both humans and animals are caused by Conidiobolus coronatus with only a few due to Conidiobolus lamprauges or Conidiobolus incongruus. In humans, the handful of reported C. incongruus cases has predominantly involved the lungs or mediastinum, but pericardial, periorbital, orbitofacial and orofacial involvement have also been seen [8]. Only four reports are available in the literature describing infection with C. incongruus in animals and all four cases involve either deer or sheep [3\u20136]. Two of these are single case reports in deer [3,6], while the other two are herd outbreaks in sheep [4,5]. Here we report the first case of C. incongruus in a dog and review the literature regarding conidiobolomycosis in animals.",

The isolate that was received was non-viable. However, photomicrographs that had been taken by the requesting laboratory (OADDL) demonstrated multi-replicative conidia (Fig. 2B). DNA sequencing on the non-viable isolate was attempted by scraping the agar surface and suspending the fungal elements in CPL-100 Buffer (VWR International INC., Radnor, PA). These were then lysed by bead beating, and DNA was isolated manually by chloroform extraction method. Extracted DNA was used for PCR amplification of ITS and D1/D2 regions as described in [9]. PCR products were then sequenced using the ITS1 and ITS4 primers as well as NL1 and NL4 primers at the UTHSCSA Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory [10]. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and queried in GenBank using the BLASTn algorithm at the NCBI site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and were also compared to those available in the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre database (www.cbs.knaw.nl). Sequencing of the ITS region was unsuccessful. However, the D1/D2 sequence showed 98.9% identity to C. incongruus NRRL 28636 (GenBank Accession no. AF113457.1; base pair match 617/624). Based on the presence of the multi-replicative conidia, which have been described as a discriminating characteristic between C. incongruus and C. lamprauges\n[11], and the D1/D2 sequence analysis, the species of this isolate was determined to be C. incongruus. The D1/D2 sequence has been deposited in GenBank under Accession no. KP777609.",
