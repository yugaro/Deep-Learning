Two weeks after the first symptoms, she developed right-sided weakness. On admission, she had no fever and normal blood pressure. Electrocardiography and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory tests showed that anti-HCV antibody was positive and HCV RNA titer was highly elevated (1,660,000 IU/mL). AST and ALT were also mildly elevated (34/44 IU/L). Her medical history revealed that she had blood transfusion during Cesarean section about twenty years ago. She had no symptoms of hepatitis. Serologic tests, including viral markers, showed nothing significant. Levels of anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were also normal. Cancer antigen 19-9, was mildly elevated (27.7 U/mL; normal range, 0.8-24.0 U/mL). The CSF examination showed three white blood cells with mildly increased protein (53 mg/dL; normal range, 15-45 mg/dL), normal IgG index, and no IgG oligoclonal bands. CSF anti-HCV antibody was positive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine revealed multifocal high signal intensity lesions on fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and cervical and thoracic spinal cord (Fig. 1). Some lesions showed enhancement after gadolinium administration.",

In our patient, HCV RNA titer was highly increased, and it was compatible with chronic C viral hepatitis on liver biopsy. During Cesarean section twenty years earlier, she had had multiple blood transfusions. Recently, however, she did not receive blood transfusion or any injection. Therefore, we suppose that the chronic HCV infection was the cause of ADEM, and that virus-triggered autoimmunity or direct viral invasion played a role in the genesis of ADEM. In a case of acute transverse myelitis associated with chronic HCV infection, anti-HCV antibody was present in the CSF.10 In our case, anti-HCV antibody was also detected in the CSF. It is hypothesized that the virus might have penetrated blood brain barrier and involved the CNS directly.",
