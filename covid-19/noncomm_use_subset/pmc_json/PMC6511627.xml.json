Hence, antibiotics are often overused and stray from the GOLD guidelines, as reported by a study conducted in Europe.6",

To compensate for this as much as possible, we also analyzed the condition bronchiectasis that was known to be highly colonized, and the difference between the two groups was not apparent. Additionally, culture test and PCR assay were performed by trained doctors. Third, we could not analyze the effect of the steroid dose and type. In the inhaled corticosteroids group, different doses and different kinds of inhalers were used, and the dose varied between 10 and 30 mg in the oral steroid use group.
