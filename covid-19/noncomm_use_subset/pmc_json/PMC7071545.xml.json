The first reports on this infection were made in December 2019 in Wuhan, China as a series of pneumonia with an unknown cause, which was linked to a novel kind of coronavirus on 31 December 2019. 1\n, 2\nSARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of this disease, is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus 3\nbelonging to betacoronavirus genera, Coronaviridae family. 4\nAlthough this group of viruses usually induces mild cold conditions, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were identified from the same family several years ago causing deadly serious respiratory diseases. 3\nIn spite of the lower fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 4\nits risks are regarded serious, mainly because of the high transmissibility of the virus and its ability to survive for long hours on different surfaces. Moreover, the reports show that it may cause only insignificant flu-like symptoms in many contaminated people 2\nwho can easily infect others in the society. On this basis, COVID-19 was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. ",

While there are still many unknowns about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, great efforts are being taken to find answers for the questions about this virus behavior, transmission, and other aspects. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced by Chinese researchers in Mid-January. 5\nThe atomic structure of the virus spike protein was also revealed by cryo-EM technique about one month later, which can specially help in vaccine design. 6",

The early results of clinical trials using chloroquine phosphate, an old anti-malaria drug, in the patients with COVID-19 was promising. 7\nTherefore, in the cocktail protocols presently used for treating patients the usage of chloroquine phosphate, as an available drug, is recommended. Gilead will start two large phase 3 studies for evaluating the safety and efficacy of remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor 4\nthat was first developed for Ebola, in about 1000 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the positive preliminary investigations and the previous results shown on MERS-CoV.
