Magnetic resonance images were acquired on 5 MRI systems, all of which were high\u2010field\u2010strength magnets (1.5 Tesla). The evaluation of MRI included the CNS region imaged and all surrounding structures. The MR images were evaluated by a board\u2010certified neurologist (EB) and a neurology resident in training (AC) blinded to the clinical signs. All studies included both spin echo or turbo spin echo T1\u2010weighted (T1W: repetition time [TR] 461\u2013992 ms; echo time [TE] 15\u201320 ms; slice thickness, 2.5\u20135.0 mm), and spin echo or turbo spin echo T2\u2010weighted (T2W: TR 2,500\u20139,000 ms; TE 80\u2013119 ms; slice thickness, 2.5\u20135.0 mm) images. T1\u2010weighted (T1W) images were acquired before and after IV administration of gadolinium contrast material (0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrola or gadopentetate dimeglumineb ). A group of these studies included T2\u2010weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (T2W\u2010FLAIR: TR 5,600\u201335,000 ms; TE 90\u2013119 ms; slice thickness, 2.5\u20135.5 mm) images and T2* gradient recall echo (T2*: TR 840\u20131,021 ms; TE 80\u2013119 ms; slice thickness, 4.0\u20135.0 mm) images. Findings were categorized as mild (focal regions of contrast enhancement of meninges, ependyma, or both without ventriculomegaly, mass effect, or dilatation of the central canal), moderate (mild ventriculomegaly with minimal mass effect and multifocal regions of contrast enhancement), or severe (marked ventriculomegaly with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe mass effect, dilatation of the central canal, and multifocal to generalized contrast enhancement). To provide a quantitative measure of the extent of ventriculomegaly, the maximum height of the fourth ventricle was recorded as a percentage of the caudal fossa brain height (cerebellum and brainstem) on midline sagittal T2W images (Fig. 1). The maximum height of the lateral ventricles at the level of the interthalamic adhesion was recorded on transverse T2W images as a percentage of the brain height at that level (Fig. 2). The height of the brain on both views was measured from a line drawn parallel and immediately adjacent to the line measuring the ventricle height.",

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain often identified marked enlargement of the fourth ventricle causing dorsal compression of the brainstem and ventral compression of the cerebellum. This compression may compromise the vestibular nuclei, vestibulocerebellum, or both, thus accounting for the high frequency of clinical vestibular deficits. Various mechanisms may contribute to abnormal mentation, including brainstem compression compromising the ascending reticular activating system, increased intracranial pressure causing diffuse forebrain compromise, or neuropathic pain secondary to syringomyelia. Tetraparesis may have resulted from compression of the descending upper motor neuron tracts as they traverse the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Seven cats experienced acute deterioration to nonambulatory status before referral. Potential underlying mechanisms for this acute deterioration may include increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation or progression of systemic disease.",

However, evaluation of meningeal contrast enhancement in MRI studies in the cat can be challenging, particularly in the absence of associated parenchymal lesions. The assessors of the MR images in our study were blinded to the clinical signs of the cats, but they were not blinded to the final diagnosis of neurologic FIP. In contrast, the previous study included various types of feline meningoencephalitis that may not be associated with vascular and superficially orientated inflammation, and thus, the authors may have been more cautious in identifying pathologic contrast enhancement of the meninges on MRI.10 Quantitative measures of the degree of contrast enhancement would be very useful to overcome this source of bias.",

The cats that were presented with a T3\u2010L3 myelopathy had neurologic deficits confined to the pelvic limbs, meningeal contrast enhancement of the spinal cord and, where imaged, the brainstem on MRI, and histopathologic lesions that consisted of pyogranulomatous or lymphoplasmacytic infiltration into the meninges of the spinal cord and brainstem. Cats with central vestibular syndrome or multifocal CNS disease typically had more severe neurologic deficits and more extensive MRI lesions with ventriculomegaly, mass effect, and more diffuse contrast enhancement affecting the ependyma, choroid plexuses, and meninges of the caudal cranial fossa that often extended to the third and lateral ventricles. Furthermore, the height of the lateral and fourth ventricles increased with worsening histopathologic lesion severity. Thus, the severity of the clinical presentation reflected the severity of the lesions detected by MRI and histopathology. Although the diagnostic utility of the proposed lesion grading schemes requires validation, the results of our case series suggest that MRI is a both sensitive tool to identify vasculitis and secondary ventriculomegaly in neurologic FIP as well as an accurate indicator of the extent of the histopathologic changes. By evaluating the severity of the clinical presentation with the extent of the MRI abnormalities, a prediction of the likely concurrent histopathologic lesions can be made.",

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed in 3 of these 6 cats, and each was found to have a markedly increased total protein concentration (2.52, 3.68 and 9.89 g/L).

Interestingly, the 3 cats with the highest total protein concentration (29.9, 28.8 and 25.5 g/L) had full CSF signal suppression on FLAIR. Therefore, CSF signal suppression in FLAIR sequences does not exclude the presence of increased CSF protein concentrations.

In dogs, ventriculomegaly is considered to be asymptomatic with normal intraventricular pressure, whereas hydrocephalus is a clinically relevant increase in CSF volume compromising the surrounding brain parenchyma.12, 22 In a recent study, a ventricle:brain index >0.6 together with dorsal deviation of the body of the corpus callosum, periventricular edema, thinning of the sulci, subarachnoid space, or both, and disruption of the internal capsule adjacent to the caudate nucleus was reported to be associated with clinically relevant dilatation of the lateral cerebral ventricles because of increased intraventricular pressure.12 A similar study has not been performed in cats, and hence, MRI features to distinguish ventriculomegaly from hydrocephalus have not been determined. For consistency, we refer to distension of the ventricles as ventriculomegaly, but acknowledge that a clinically relevant, pathologic increase in CSF volume causing compromise of the surrounding parenchyma is likely to be present in many FIP\u2010affected cats. The finding that increased ventricular size was associated with a more severe clinical presentation and more extensive histopathologic changes supports the likely pathologic relevance of ventriculomegaly. Further studies including a comparison between ventricular dimensions in normal and FIP\u2010affected cats would be valuable. Finally, MRI identified ventriculomegaly in 20 cats, whereas postmortem examination detected ventriculomegaly in only 10 cats, suggesting that high\u2010field MRI may have higher sensitivity for detecting pathologic changes in the ventricular dimensions.",

A difference in grade of MRI and histopathologic findings was identified in 1 cat, in which euthanasia was performed 6 days after MRI.

Confirmation of FIP was primarily based on histopathologic identification of consistent lesions. Feline infectious peritonitis is distinguished pathologically from other infectious causes of meningitis and encephalitis, such as feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, rabies, pseudorabies, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptococcus neoformans, by the presence of vascular and superficially orientated pyogranulomatous inflammation in the absence of visible fungal and bacterial pathogens.5, 8 The gross and histologic lesions of FIP are typical, and a thorough postmortem examination with adequate histopathologic examination of diseased tissues can be an accurate way to confirm a diagnosis.1, 8 Should there be an element of uncertainty in the pathologist's interpretation of the lesions, immunohistochemistry to detect viral antigen can aid in obtaining a definitive diagnosis.1, 24 Although a definitive diagnosis of FIP was made in each case in our series based on characteristic histopathologic findings, immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 cats, which confirmed the presence of viral antigen within the CNS of all 10 cats.",
