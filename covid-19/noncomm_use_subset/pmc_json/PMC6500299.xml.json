Participants framed these comparisons on the weaknesses of the US healthcare system by discussing the motivations and standard practices of other healthcare systems. As one participant noted during an interview, \u2018The goal of many countries\u2019 healthcare system is to serve their citizens fully\u2026They start off in a different place than where we are\u2019 (PL #7, interview).",

This was attributed to them spending \u2018a lot of time doing paperwork, less time doing patient interaction or [having] meaningful patient interaction\u2019 (PL #6, interview).

They perceived a decline in the USA healthcare system and that global health work was seen as a more personally beneficial and altruistic endeavour:",

The participants responded in a variety of ways\u2014most of which contained elements of doubt, cynicism, disinterest or a perceived greater ability to support impactful changes to foreign healthcare systems. Discussing their personal experiences with the US healthcare system, one participant noted: \u2018There are so many competing agendas, and it is the big money that is going to win out. I hate to sound cynical\u2019 (PL #7, interview). Another participant explained that their work providing technical expertise to the Kenyan Health Ministry \u2018can make public health decisions that have a big impact much more easily than anybody here [in the USA] can have\u2019 (PL #6, interview). Several participants discussed how they had previously been involved in US healthcare advocacy and reform work, but had either lost interest, were too busy with their global health work, or had felt that they were able to bring about more meaningful reforms in non-USA healthcare systems: \u2018One of the things is I used to follow US medical care, a lot, but I can\u2019t keep up, just because I try to keep up with things going on overseas\u2026I used to know a lot about this stuff\u2019 (PL #2, interview).",

We reached out to 159 individuals and programmes, 30 opened the questionnaire link, and only 12 completed the questionnaire (7.5% response rate). The study\u2019s small sample size was most likely a result of physician and programme leadership survey fatigue\u2014which, the research team was told directly by several who declined to participate\u2014limiting the generalisability of our findings. Future qualitative research on this or similar participant demographics should consider survey fatigue and explore ways to increase response rates, such as more in-person interviews and, if ethically feasible, participant observation. A more grounded research design that develops interview guides based on initial questionnaire responses will likely improve the scope and focus of participant responses, as well. While thematic saturation was not achieved, we hope that our identified themes can act as a starting point for future research on the topic of how global health work is perceived to impact USA patient care. One example might be an experimental study investigating global health physician spending patterns compared with physicians who have not practiced abroad. We also feel that future research seeking to understand the growing interest in the global health field could investigate how perceived conflict of values between altruistically driven physicians and the USA healthcare system could act as a potential force in generating more interest in global health, and how the USA healthcare system or individual institutions could decrease physician discontentment associated with a conflict of care values.",

Among the five themes identified through questionnaires and interviews with global health physicians and global health programme leaders, two themes were centred on the impact of global health work on USA patient care: global health may improve patient rapport for physicians caring for immigrant and low-socioeconomic patients, may reduce healthcare spending by providers and may lead to more effective patient care. The other three identified themes were that global health work is largely motivated by altruistic values, leads to a greater awareness of the social determinants of health and gives rise to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the USA healthcare system. Participants saw these themes as interrelated, such as how global health work allows for more personally rewarding physician\u2013patient interactions compared with the USA healthcare system, which was viewed as flawed, unwieldy and obdurate, and in need of reform.",
