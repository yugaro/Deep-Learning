In Canada, Salmonella is the main pathogen, responsible for 50%, and hepatitis A virus is responsible for 0.1% of foodborne diseases from fresh produce 2. Although viruses are not the major pathogen in Canadian fresh produce, they are prevalent in farm-level infection such as hepatitis E virus (34%), porcine enteric calicivirus (20%), and rotavirus (7%) in finisher pigs 3.

Ideally these control points should include all steps or procedures involved in food handling from farm to fork, including food production, storage, transportation, delivery, and consumption.

Noroviruses in the sample were absorbed on microbeads by bead beating lysis and electrostatic physisorption. The extracted RNA was amplified and detected in a detection chamber.

A visible color from red to blue can be produced variously with colorimetric detectability (Figure 4). An advanced example of plasmonic nanomaterials is direct aggregation, without specific ligands between a single-stranded primer DNA, and its adsorption on citrate-coated Au gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, indirect aggregation can be used to detect viruses through modifying virus targeting molecules on virus surfaces. The challenging key to this technology is controlling particle aggregation in a reproducible manner. This can be improved using a protein-glycan pairing relying on the multivalence properties of glycan to improve weak protein detection of viral surface proteins. Another advanced improvement is signal amplification using catalytic or DNA enzymatic assays, such as alkaline phosphatase catalyst, and DNA enzymes to provide rapid detection of virus sequences.",

The opportunity to apply bacterial detection techniques to virus is low because bacteria are easier to be cultured and amplified, but virus culture and amplification are difficult and cannot be enriched in most cases 35. Moreover viruses cannot replicate in host free environments and is almost always found in low numbers in the complex food matrices. The size of viruses ranges from 20 to 400 nm, while the size of bacteria ranges from 1 micron to 5 microns. Due to the extremely smaller size of viruses, the sensing platforms developed for bacteria need to be extensively modified for the detection of virus particles. In addition, the composition of cell surface (peptidoglycan) proteins of bacteria is not comparable with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase compositions of viruses, and the biorecognition elements has to be tailor made to create the binding with the proteins. Along with smaller sizes, absence of cell wall and ribosomes in the viruses in comparison to the bacteria also allows for changes in the localized microenvironment towards the development of biosensing platforms. Considering the factors of bacterial detection techniques that cannot be used for viral detection, and that viruses often present with lower copy numbers than bacteria in food samples, this situation demands superior sensitivity of the virus detection devices to be at least attomolar or picomolar level.",
