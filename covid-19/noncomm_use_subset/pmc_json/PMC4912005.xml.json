Thus, physicians treating PCD adapt therapeutic approaches used for other chronic respiratory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and non\u2010CF bronchiectasis. Differences in various phenotypic parameters among PCD, CF, and non\u2010CF bronchiectasis suggest that extrapolating therapies may not be appropriate for PCD management in some circumstances.23, 24, 25, 26 \n",

The GDMCC includes clinicians at nine academic centers in North America that have systematically evaluated over 1,000 patients suspected of having PCD and performed longitudinal studies of pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD. The GDMCC also works closely with the PCD Foundation on research and clinical PCD projects. This consensus statement is evidence based where possible, and addresses key clinical PCD issues, but it is not the product of GRADE recommendations.27 Through telephone conferences, email communications, and in person meetings, eight pediatric pulmonologists, two adult pulmonologists, and two otolaryngologists from North America undertook to: (1) describe the PCD clinical phenotype, (2) establish standard PCD diagnostic recommendations, (3) recommend PCD clinical care and long\u2010term monitoring schedules, and (4) outline clinical therapies used to manage PCD. After a literature review (using Pubmed and Embase), drafts were created and circulated iteratively to participating physicians with discussion of feedback and suggestions over sequential telephone conferences and electronic communications. Participating GDMCC physicians and the PCD Foundation governing board unanimously approved this consensus statement.",

A small proportion of PCD patients are discharged home on day 1 of life but are then hospitalized with respiratory distress within the first few weeks of life. Often misdiagnosed with TTN or pneumonia, PCD infants frequently require supplemental oxygen for days to weeks.

Furthermore, it is essential that biopsies are collected when patients are at their baseline health, as secondary changes in ciliary ultrastructure can occur during respiratory exacerbations.15 Thus, biopsies should be delayed until at least 2 weeks after full recovery from an illness. For absence of inner dynein arms in isolation, repeat biopsy and EM studies are always required to verify that this pathologic change persists and therefore is more likely genetic (primary) and not from secondary causes.11 One may also consider repeat biopsies to verify the universality and permanence of findings suggestive of central apparatus, radial spoke, or inner dynein arm with microtubule disorganization defects.

No documented cases of digenic inheritance (heterozygous mutations in two different PCD genes), unequivocally associated with human PCD, exist thus far. Currently, the most comprehensive commercial PCD genetic panel tests 19 PCD genes through next generation sequencing (NGS), at a cost of $1,990, and detects approximately 50% of PCD cases.75 Genetic testing costs for other commercial NGS panels range from $1,500 to $4,500 and often include full cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein analysis.76, 77, 78 Results may contain genetic variants of unknown significance, and a genetic diagnosis may not be clearly established.

All nNO values from healthy control subjects (open circles) were well above the cutoff of 77 nl/min and most of the nNO measurements in subjects with PCD and ciliary ultrastructure defects (open triangles, single measurements; solid triangles, repeated measurements) were below the cutoff. Findings are similar in disease controls, including asthma and COPD (data not shown). The three solid triangles above the cutoff are repeated measurements in the same individual with PCD.
