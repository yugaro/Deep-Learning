No significant similarities were observed at the nucleotide level. Assembly of these reads generated 6 contigs with high sequencing depth and lengths ranging from 218 to 2353 nucleotides (nt) (Table 3). BLAST searches of these contigs revealed that they show similarities to the nearly full-length segments of Wellfleet Bay virus and Tjuloc virus ORFs: Hemagglutinin (HA), Nucleoprotein (NP), Polymerase basic 1 protein (PB1), Polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2), and Polymerase Acidic protein (PA) (Figure 2). However, the identified ORFs exhibit high genetic diversity to known quaranjavirus genomes, with an amino acid identity of only 32\u201355%, indicating that these represent novel viral sequences belonging to the Quaranjavirus genus. One of the contigs (contig6, 218 nt long) showed an amino acid identity of 55% to the NP protein of WFBV; however, it did not assemble with the other NP-classified reads in the data set. The BLAST hit results for this contig included a hypothetical protein of the Tjuloc virus and Quaranfil virus with an identity of 32%. This contig could, therefore, be a matrix protein or another viral protein divergent from previously known quranjaviral segments.

The majority of the viral sequences belonged to the Orthomyxoviride family and was therefore studied in more detail; however, other viral families such as Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified.

            "text": "The Orthomyxoviridae family consists of six recognized genera: Influenza A, B, and C, Isavirus, Thogotovirus, Quaranjavirus and the newly proposed Influenza D. Viruses in this family infect a broad range of hosts including humans, birds, swine, fish and arthropods, and transmission occurs by different routes such as fecal-oral, water, air, and direct contact [20]. The genus Quaranjavirus was approved by ICTV in 2011 and included two new species, Quaranfil virus (QRFV) and Johnston Atoll virus (JAV), as well as a tentative member, Lake Chad virus (LKCV). These viruses were isolated in the 1950s and 1960s but were only recently recognized as quaranjaviruses. They appear to be mainly associated with ticks (QRFV and JAV) and birds (LKCV) [21\u201324]. In the present study, novel viral sequences showing sequence identity to quaranjaviruses were characterized from Rhipicephalus spp. ticks in Mozambique using high-throughput sequencing. These sequences are highly divergent from all known quaranjaviruses, with approximately 50% amino acid identity. BLASTx search analyses show that these sequences are most closely related to WFBV and TLV. In the phylogeny, the PB1 protein sequence from this study clustered with quaranjaviruses and showed closest relationship to WFBV. At this point, we are not sure if the sequences found in this study belong to one, two or more viruses. Future studies are needed to show this. The mechanism of transmission is uncertain, but it is speculated that soft and hard ticks are the primary vectors [25,26]. Several studies have identified quaranjaviruses in other arthropod vectors, such as spiders, mosquitoes and horseflies [27]. Little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of quaranjaviruses. The viruses in this genus are globally distributed throughout the Middle East, Africa and Pacific regions.",

In contrast, endosymbionts may interact with arthropod-borne pathogens and play a crucial role in the fitness of the arthropod vector. For instance, Coxiella endosymbionts of Amblyomma ticks impair the transmission of Ehrlichia chaffiensis [31]. Further, in another important arthropod vector, the mosquito, the Wolbachia symbiont can limit the replication of several pathogenic viruses such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus and different protozoans such as Plasmodium [32\u201334]. It has also been demonstrated that pathogens may influence the microbiome of arthropod vectors by modulating immune responses for its survival and infection [35]. Thus, characterizing the microbiome of ticks and other arthropods is just the first step to understanding the complex interactions between the different microorganisms that reside within the vector.",
