This virus is considered to have originated from the feline parvovirus.1 After it emerged, the original type 2 virus develops its antigenic variant through five to six amino acid changes in its VP2 protein. A few years later, a second variant, CPV\u20102b, was discovered,3 and a third variant, CPV\u20102c, was identified in Italy in 20004 and quickly spread through the canine population in that nation,1 as well as in other European,5, 6 Asian7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and American countries.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

Hence, laboratory tests are essential for confirming the clinical diagnosis. Because a point mutation at the amino acid position 426 in the VP2 protein has been identified to be associated with the different types of CPV\u20102, sequencing analysis by conventional PCR can be utilized to provide details in terms of CPV typing.4 In addition, this amino acid substitution is caused by mutating AAT (2a) to GAT (2b) at nucleotide position 1276 or to GAA (2c) at nucleotide positions 1276 and 1278 in the VP2 gene.4\n",

HI testing using MAbs helps to predict CPV\u20102 antigen specificity, which distinguishes the CPV\u20102 variants. Although types 2a and 2b differ in their lack of MAb B4A2 reactivity to CPV\u20102b, this MAb cannot recognize type CPV\u20102c. Thus, a MAb was developed to differentiate the new variant, 2c, from type 2b.8 However, only samples with high HA titers (\u22651:64) can be characterized using MAbs, and several samples containing high viral DNA titers that tested negative or poorly positive by HA have been calculated by real\u2010time PCR.20, 21 In addition, nonhemagglutinating strains have been described.22 The PCR\u2010RFLP assay with enzyme MboII 4 can only identify CPV\u20102c. Both types 2a and 2b are unrecognized by the enzyme and consequently are indistinguishable by utilizing this method; thus, this sequence analysis is often required to definitively characterize the strain, which is more expensive and time\u2010consuming.21 PCR\u2010based methods have been developed to identify type 2, 2a and 2b CPVs 23 by utilizing nucleotide differences between the primers restricted to one base on their 3\u2032 end. However, these mismatches at the 3\u2032 end of the primers would be insufficient to prevent other CPV\u20102 types from amplifying.4 In addition, among the type\u2010specific PCR assays, CPV\u20102c is undetectable, as the Asp426Glu substitution is due to a change (T to A) at the third codon position at nucleotide 1278 of the VP gene, this mutant is recognized erroneously as type 2b using this PCR strategy.4\n",
