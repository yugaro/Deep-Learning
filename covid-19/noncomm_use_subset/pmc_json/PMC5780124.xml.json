This increase has been more marked in developed countries, where 6\u201330% of patients in Intensive Care Units suffer from sepsis (2). Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in patients in Intensive Care Units (3) and the associated burden of care incurs financial burden. However, the pathogenesis of sepsis remains to be fully delineated and effective therapies are lacking. A state of immunosuppression induced by sepsis has been demonstrated in clinical and experimental sepsis (3), with the majority of patients who have succumbed to sepsis-associated mortality showing evidence of immunosuppression and unresolved septic foci (4).",

            "text": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are an essential component of the innate immune system, involved in the clearance of extracellular pathogens (5). As the most abundant subset of leukocytes, the involvement of PMN in sepsis is significant (3,6,7). The migration of PMNs is regulated by chemoattractants and chemokine gradients (3,7,8). CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1 and CXCR2 are the major chemokine receptors on PMNs, with interleukin (IL)-8 acting as a ligand of these receptors (9). Severe sepsis is associated with the failure of PMNs to migrate (10). In a previous clinical study, patients with suppression of PMN receptors were predisposed to inflammatory response syndrome (11). Previous in vitro investigations have demonstrated that CXCR2 is downregulated upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (12). The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) also suppresses the expression of CXCR2 (13). In an experimental mouse model of sepsis, the failure of PMNs to migrate was shown to result in a high rate of mortality (1). Tancevski et al and Van Zee et al reported that promoting the recruitment of PMNs ameliorates sepsis and attenuates sepsis-related injury and infection, respectively (14,15). Therefore, in order to improve treatment of inflammatory disorders, including sepsis, the promotion of PMN chemotaxis is an attractive target (6).",

In addition to being used to cure febrile diseases, including dipsosis, fever, jaundice and hematemesis, F. isatidis is also deployed against diseases, including mumps, viral hepatitis, influenza and epidemic encephalitis B (16\u201318). It was reported to be effective during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome flu outbreak (19). These antimicrobial and anti-endotoxic properties indicate its potential to be developed into a natural antibiotic (20,21). In our previous study (22), the main chemical components of F. isatidis were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography. It was also demonstrated that F. isatidis increased the survival of septic mice, and ameliorated lung injury by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 through the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways (22). Although the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of F. isatidis have been the focus of previous investigations, whether this herb has an effect on chemokine receptors remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine whether F. isatidis affects the migration of PMNs.",

The blood was transferred into heparin lithium-containing tubes (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). The samples were processed within 1 h of collection. Whole blood was incubated with 3% dextran T-500 in the dark at room temperature for 20 min for sedimentation of red blood cells (RBCs). Following sedimentation, the white blood cell-enriched upper phase was layered over a Ficoll-Paque solution (GE Healthcare Life Science, Uppsala, Sweden). Centrifugation was performed at 427 \u00d7 g at room temperature for 20 min without breaks, resulting in four distinct layers. The first three layers were discarded, and the remaining layer containing granulocytes and remnant RBCs was diluted in ACK lysis buffer (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).

The results showed that LPS treatment resulted in decreased expression levels of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A-C), which was in accordance with the results of a previous study (23). However, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of TLR2, TLR4 or CD11b in the LPS-treated neutrophils, compared with the vehicle-treated neutrophils (Fig. 1D-F).

Therefore, novel pharmacological strategies are urgently required to promote the treatment of sepsis (30). With the ability to promote the expression of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L, n-butanol extract itself is a potential candidate for the treatment of LPS-induced sepsis. However, due to the presence of multiple bioactive components in the extract and limited approaches for preparing extracts from F. isatidis, it is difficult to identify the precise agent inhibiting LPS-induced chemokine receptor downregulation. Although the main active chemical components have been identified, there are more than eight major compounds in n-butanol extract (22). Further investigation is required to identify the active compound in F. isatidis.",
