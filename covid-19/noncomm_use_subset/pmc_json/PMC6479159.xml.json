The \u201cOne Health\u201d approach is predicated on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes across all three sectors, with various efforts providing guidance and suggestions as to how these principles can be applied in practice [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Concurrently, global health security frameworks, notably the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), have highlighted the critical importance of multisectoral, One Health collaboration. The GHSA references One Health explicitly in its goal to accelerate progress towards full compliance with the IHR 2005 and ensure that all countries in the world can detect, assess, report, and respond to emerging public health events of international concern, including outbreaks of zoonotic diseases [6,7].",

The first step, which started in September 2015, wasto determine which stakeholders in Guinea would need to be engaged during the project. This was achieved through consultation with partners in Guinea, as well as a review of existing published reports on zoonotic diseases in Guinea. The second step was to determine the list of priority zoonotic diseases. This was achieved by conducting a literature search for the zoonotic diseases likely to be present or of high risk of emergence in Guinea, comparing the diseases identified via peer-reviewed and \u201cgrey\u201d literature publications to available ministerial reportable disease lists, and holding a facilitated roundtable discussion among the ministries to add or remove diseases from consideration, and then prioritize. During the roundtable discussion, held in November 2015, we convened representatives from MOH, MOL, and MOE to categorize the different zoonotic diseases as emerging, epidemic-prone, or endemic in Guinea, as well as review the factors to be considered for prioritization in the Guinean context. Examples of factors included the economic and/or social impact of the disease, the case fatality rate in humans and/or animals, the overall health burden or morbidity caused by the disease, and implications for trade. Facilitators started the discussion by mentioning common zoonotic diseases and asking each Ministry (MOH, MOL, MOE) to present their perspectives related to the different factors. Participants were encouraged to provide supporting evidence on potential priority zoonotic diseases, including national statistics on prevalence, distribution, economic impact, and case fatality rate, where available. Disease information from international normative sources, such as WHO and OIE, was used alongside national data when considering the various factors. The list was then narrowed through group consensus discussion, with facilitators ensuring even contribution from all sectors, to six, to fulfill the GHSA requirement of targeting at least five priority zoonotic diseases.",

Between November 2015 and April 2016, the research team examined the processes for each disease from initial detection in a human or animal host to declaration of the end of an outbreak, including: routine and event-based surveillance, sample collection and management; laboratory testing and confirmation; local, national, and international reporting; case management; and emergency response procedures. We focused primarily on areas of coordination and communication between the sectors, and included an administration assessment at all levels: local, intermediate, and national. We sought data from three main sources: (1) direct interviews with stakeholders, including approximately 15 ministry officials from MOH, MOL and MOE at national and sub-national levels; (2) site visits to key facilities at the national and sub-national level; and (3) two information-gathering workshops (conducted in November 2015 and January 2016) to convene partners and stakeholders from government together with non-governmental and international organizations working in global health security and health systems strengthening. (Site visit questionnaires and workshop participating institutions/organizations are available as Supplementary Materials.) The research team then used the information gathered to develop systems \u201cmaps\u201d for each disease, highlighting where existing processes included formal and informal communication or collaboration by phone, email, or participation to joint investigation between sectors as well as existing gaps. The systems maps and identified gaps were validated with key partners and stakeholders.",

Consensus between participants on each recommendation was achieved through facilitated small-group discussion, with final review by the whole group. The recommendations included the estimated relative level of investment and time required to achieve and complete each gap. Criteria for the investment and time estimations included requirements for equipment and tools, technical expertise and resources as well as other required inputs.

Prioritization was defined based on the impact of filling the gap(s). \u201cLow priority\u201d was defined as an activity that would demonstrate Guinea's commitment to compliance with IHR (2005) and other capacity-building frameworks, would achieve a short-term goal, and/or result in a transient benefit. \u201cMedium-priority\u201d was defined as an activity that would strengthen baseline capacities, including equipment, processes, and/or materials with some sustained benefit. \u201cHigh priority\u201d was defined as an activity that would strengthen infrastructure, systems, and/or workforce for ongoing activities with far-reaching benefits.",

Although there were some suggestions from stakeholders that capacities for EVD might translate across similar VHFs such as Lassa fever, our discussions revealed that in most cases, the capacities were built solely with EVD in mind, and would not necessarily extend to other VHFs, particularly those with existing vertical control efforts (such as YF) or those that have a predominantly veterinary impact (such as RVF). While there was a clear need to focus narrowly on EVD during the outbreak response, this finding highlights the potential for missed opportunities for integrating vertical disease targeting with more foundational capacities as the response transitions to recovery, which could be used to address a greater variety of health threats.",

In certain cases, human bite victims might present first to the local livestock post, because if livestock authorities confirm that the animal is suspected to be rabid or unavailable for testing, this may facilitate the patient's ability to secure post-exposure prophylaxis. However, these bite data are not routinely shared at higher levels of each sector's administration, and the MOE, despite being responsible for wildlife issues, including surveillance for rabid wildlife, is not involved in these processes. At the time of this study, the only laboratory equipped to diagnose rabies in animals was the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (LCVD) in Conakry; at the time of our site visit in November 2015, the equipment was non-functional. However, since then the LCVD lab has been renovated and is now functional. In addition, the Pasteur Institute in Guinea has renovated a laboratory within the Gamal Abdul Nasser University of Conakry that has the capacity to diagnose rabies and other zoonotic diseases. Despite these improvements, the Pasteur Institute of Dakar continues to serve as Guinea's reference laboratory for rabies confirmation [12]. A primary challenge remains the transport of specimens from the field to the LCVD. Furthermore, neither of the Guinean laboratories are currently able to diagnose rabies in humans.",

Brucellosis is not listed under WHO's Africa Regional Office (AFRO) technical guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), and at the time of our study was not included in Guinea's overall national priority diseases [13]. However, countries are able to add locally important diseases when adapting IDSR for national use, and, after the completion of our assessment, Guinea added brucellosis to their national list. While overall knowledge of the disease and its symptoms is thought by Ministry officials to be currently weak, especially at the local level (for example, there is no national database for brucellosis reporting), plans are in place to reinforce knowledge with support of the recently developed IDSR data collection tool scheduled for roll-out before the end of 2018. At the time of the assessment, diagnostic capability was restricted to the veterinary sector, with basic agglutination tests available at the national and regional levels as well as at the national veterinary university (the Higher Institute of Science and Veterinary Medicine in Dalaba). Staff at the LCVD were also trained in complement fixation though shortages of reagents was a limiting factor. Despite these options for screening and confirmation, samples were rarely collected and tested, and reagents rarely available. More recently, technicians from the LCVD, the Higher Institute of Science and Veterinary Medicine, and the Pasteur Institute have received additional training on basic and advanced diagnostics; however, testing capacity is still limited. As with many priority diseases, Guinea lacks a robust supply chain for reagents, routine collection of samples, and systematic testing when samples are received. The anticipated IDSR data collection tool will contribute to alleviating some of the deficiencies, including hopefully strengthening communication of cases in animals to the human health sector and vice versa, and facilitate the establishment of a national database.",

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (Fig. 4) was the target of several multisectoral, One Health capacity building efforts by FAO, the World Bank, and other partners between 2005 and 2010 [14,15]. Projects included the provision of equipment (such as disinfectant sprayers, personal protective equipment, and sample collection equipment) at the regional level. They also included equipping the veterinary services' mobile laboratory units in Labe and Kankan, as well as training local level environment and livestock agents to conduct joint investigations of fowl die-offs and report unusual waterfowl or poultry deaths to the respective higher level authorities. The work included development of a multisectoral, One Health preparedness and response plan involving the MOH and MOE (which at the time also included responsibilities for agriculture and livestock development) that defined roles and responsibilities for actors from the human, animal and environmental sectors [16]. However, no human or animal cases of avian influenza was subsequently reported in Guinea and project funding ended. As such, lacking for cases to investigate or samples to collect, the acquired capacity rapidly degraded. By the time of our assessment in January 2016, the mobile laboratory unit in Labe was no longer functional. It lacked any means of transportation, had extremely limited equipment and lost half of its support staff. The 2012 OIE Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Gap Analysis recommended to re-equip and re-train this unit and its analogue in Kankan, and suggested each should be staffed by five veterinarians and at least two support staff [17]. As of August 2018, the recommendations have not been addressed.",

However, despite these challenges, efforts to create One Health linkages across ministries can provide a foundation upon which to build future capacity. For example, previous training of local environment and animal health agents to report poultry and waterfowl die-offs has established personnel linkages between the sectors at the community level which, while in need of strengthening and reinforcing, are largely still viable, based on our discussions with local-level agents across the different sectors. Efforts to strengthen capacities may be even more successful if built upon endemic diseases, for which cases will be identified with some regularity, such as brucellosis or rabies. As a direct result of the assessment, joint renewed interest between MOH and MOL to implement national rabies control facilitated their first-ever participation at the Pan-African Rabies Control Network (PARACON) meeting in June 2016 [18] and will support them in efforts to achieve WHO/FAO/OIE's Zero by 30 global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 [19]. The process of conducting the assessment itself also served as a catalyst for information-sharing between ministries on various zoonotic diseases and generated greater interest in future opportunities for closer collaboration. This outcome has also been observed with the use of other One Health tools, such as CDC's Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Tool (ZDPT), which also serves to assist countries in establishing a consensus list of priority zoonotic diseases [20,21]. While developed at approximately the same time as the methodology described here, the ZDPT uses a more formalized decision-making process, which may be advantageous in cases where there is conflict between sectors or objectivity is highly valued, or to determine more quantitatively the relative contributions of each sector.",

The process of disease prioritization was cited in Guinea's 2017 Joint External Evaluation Mission Report as a positive step towards meeting requirements under the \u201cZoonotic Diseases\u201d technical area [22]. Encouragingly, since the report was shared, a variety of programs have been launched which have contributed to addressing some of the recommendations highlighted through the assessment, signifying important progress towards a more holistic and functional One Health approach to disease control in Guinea. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Preparedness & Response (P&R) program, which launched in Guinea as our assessment was concluding, provided important contributions to our second stakeholder workshop, and was thus able to align programmatic activities with the recommendations presented in our report. USAID's P&R program has been instrumental in providing support for the creation of a national \u201cOne Health Platform,\u201d a multisectoral coordinating mechanism which aims to support One Health activities, including oversight for implementation of the inherently multisectoral GHSA. This effort aligns directly with one of the first recommendations in our assessment, which we estimated as high priority, low investment, and achievable in the short-term: to establish a One Health technical committee to guide future collaboration between sectors with respect to disease control. With leadership comprised of representatives from all relevant technical ministries, including health, environment, and livestock, Guinea's One Health Platform was formally established in July 2017 via joint decree from the Ministries of Health, Livestock, and Environment [23]. The process leading to its establishment has greatly raised the profile of One Health in Guinea, and as such has contributed to a general increase in activities taking a One Health approach at a programmatic level. For example, representatives from both MOE and MOL have been an integral part of the effort to revise Guinea's national disease surveillance guidelines under the auspices of IDSR; previously, this would have been managed solely by the MOH. Veterinarians are also now included in the two training levels of the Field Epidemiology Training Program, supported by the US CDC through the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET). The programs have been modified to take into consideration concerns of veterinarians and make use of zoonotic disease case studies. Outbreak investigation has become more collaborative with animal and human health teams co-investigating the last four suspected anthrax outbreaks in animals, with both the MOH and MOL contributing resources to the field missions. Similarly, investigations of zoonotic diseases such as yellow fever, led by the health sector, now include the participation of the animal and environmental sector.",
