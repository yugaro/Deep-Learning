Abdominal ultrasound was normal when performed at the first presentation, but repeat examination 2 months later showed mild, diffuse small intestinal thickening. Intestinal layering was preserved, but thickening of the muscularis layer was noted. The cat was subsequently diagnosed with lymphoplasmacytic colitis on endoscopic biopsies of the colon, with suspicion of extension to the ileum, based on sonographic appearance and weight loss. Endoscopic ileal biopsies were attempted but were unsuccessful.

Hypertension was confirmed with high definition oscillometry (204/112 [VET HDO monitor; S+B medVet GmbH]). There was a mild hypokalaemia (3.1 mmol/l; reference interval [RI] 3.5\u20135.8 mmol/l) and hypochloraemia (110 mmol/l; RI 112\u2013129 mmol/l), but blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal. USG remained poorly concentrated at 1.022. The cat\u2019s plasma appeared icteric, and serum bilirubin was 32 \u03bcmol/l (RI 0\u201315 \u03bcmol/l). Differential diagnoses for the seizures included hypertensive encephalopathy, an ischaemic or haemorrhagic infarct, structural intracranial disease and metabolic causes. The retinal detachment was presumed to be secondary to hypertension at this stage, with IRIS stage 1 chronic kidney disease suspected.16 This was based on inadequately concentrated urine and failure to identify other metabolic causes of hypertension such as diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism. Further investigations were planned to identify a cause for the hyperbilirubinaemia and the cat continued to eat and drink.",
