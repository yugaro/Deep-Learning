It can be comprehended as a neuropathological process caused by drug stimulation, results in the construction of obsessive drug-seeking behaviour (Robbins and Everitt 2002). Due to the molecular mechanism related to drug addiction is very complex and mysterious (Kenny 2014; Sun et al. 2016), it believes that studying the biological mechanism of drug addiction is of great significance for the treatment and intervention of drug addiction.",

            "text": "Morphine is a very effective opiate analgesic drug widely used to ease both acute and chronic pain (Du 2018). However, morphine has become a commonly abused recreational drug due to its widespread availability and a high potential for addiction (Kim et al. 2016). Researching the pathogenesis of morphine addiction can provide new ideas and theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of opioid addiction and clinical treatment. Earlier experimental studies have indicated that neuronal cell mitochondrial dysfunction happens in morphine addiction process, which in turn induces cell autophagy (Lixia et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2016; Su et al. 2017). Su et al. (2017) reported that compared to wild-type mice, mice specific knockout of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) and Atg7 in dopaminergic neurons had lower sensitivities to constructing morphine-induced addictive behaviours. Orexin1 receptor (OX1R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor in central nervous system, which contributed to the establishment of morphine addiction (Baimel et al. 2015). c-fos is a proto-oncogene that expressed in central neurons after adverse stimulation (Dziopa et al. 2011). Studies in rats revealed that c-fos protein took part in the neurobiological responses to morphine in dopamine neurons (Dziopa et al. 2011). Besides, both ERK and PKC pathways have been found to participate in the morphine-mediated drug addiction (Liu et al. 2016; Pena et al. 2018).",

As a class of regulatory RNAs, lncRNAs have been discovered to engage in the modulation of numerous biological processes (Quinn and Chang 2016). Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is an lncRNA that attends to the modulation of cell autophagy (Pawar et al. 2016). However, most of the current studies only focus on the roles of MEG3 in cancer cell autophagy (Xia et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018). Whether MEG3 engages in the morphine-caused neuronal cell autophagy remains unclear.",

            "text": "Morphine is one of the most abundant alkaloids isolated from the poppy plants (Du 2018). Although morphine has strong analgesic activity, the addiction of morphine also is a very serious social issue (Kim et al. 2016; Antolak et al. 2017). Many efforts have been made to explore the molecular basis of morphine addiction and some molecules and cellular biological processes have been found. OX1R, c-fos, ERK and PKC pathways are all discovered to join in morphine addiction. For example, Erami et al. (2012) reported that suppression of OX1R decreased the progress of morphine tolerance and physical dependence in rats. Siahposht-Khachaki et al. (2018) indicated that exposure to morphine produced an elevation of c-fos expression in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of Wistar rats. In addition, Liu et al. (2016) illustrated that ERK pathway contributed to the maintenance of morphine-mediated memory in hippocampus. Pena et al. (2018) pointed out that followed by morphine stimulation, PKC pathway in mouse neuroblastoma cells was activated. As an intracellular protein self-degradation process capable of upholding cellular metabolism, cell autophagy also has been demonstrated to take part in morphine-mediated drug addiction (Lixia et al. 2010; Su et al. 2017). In the cell autophagy process, the LC3-I binds to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which joins in the formation of autophagosome membranes (Pugsley 2017). Beclin-1, also known as Atg6, is a key regulator of cell autophagy (Booth et al. 2014). Herein, we found that the OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions in HT22 cells were all increased after morphine stimulation. The LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expressions were also elevated in HT22 cells after morphine stimulation. Therefore, we proposed that morphine-stimulated HT22 cells could be utilized as an in vitro cell model of morphine addiction to explore the influence of MEG3 on morphine addiction.",

What\u2019s more, some lncRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to neuroplasticity (Sartor et al. 2012; Bohnsack et al. 2019). These findings provide great motivation for studying the influences of lncRNAs on drug addiction. MEG3 has been proved to take part in the modulation of cell autophagy, especially in brain cells (Xu et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018). Su et al. (2019) indicated that MEG3 might participate in the methamphetamine-mediated addiction in mice. In this study, we discovered that morphine exposure elevated the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, the silence of MEG3 relieved the morphine-stimulated HT22 cell autophagy through declining the Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I expressions. Besides, we also discovered that the silence of MEG3 lowered the c-fos and p/t-ERK expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells, but had no significant influence on OX1R and p/t-PKC expressions. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused HT22 cell autophagy. Considering that c-fos and ERK pathway also have been found to join in the regulation of cell autophagy (Wu et al. 2018; Fung and Liu 2019), the findings of our research suggested that up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy might be achieved by elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation.",
