Cohort 1 comprised hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), which was determined based on cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and/or acute fever>37.5\u00b0C. For recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected upon hospital admission. Cohort 2 comprised outpatients with diarrhea, who had> 3 loose stools in the previous 24 hours. Patients who had confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, food intolerance, or patients who had any apparent clinical respiratory signs or symptoms were excluded. Stool samples were collected from the recruited patients. Cohort 3 consisted of patients who were diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), according to the guidelines released by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.moh.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/mohyzs/s3586/201004/46884.htm). The outpatients were generally mild, with fever, and manifested at least one of the following features: maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms, and/or soles, vesicles or ulcers in the mouth. Hospitalized patients were diagnosed with severe HFMD if they manifested one of the following additional complications: encephalitis, meningitis, AFP, or cardiorespiratory failure. For all HFMD patients, stool samples were collected, whereas for some cases, stool, throat swab, and serum samples were collected. In addition, CSF was additionally collected for some cases diagnosed with encephalitis. Healthy children who were recruited from the community during the same study period were used as controls, from whom stool, throat swab, and serum samples were also collected. None of the recruited healthy children exhibited ARTI, diarrhea, or HFMD-related symptoms during the recent one month of recruit.",

We additionally analyzed whether the co-detection of SAFV might aggravate the clinical outcome of EV infected HFMD patients (Table 3). The results demonstrated that 18 out of 23 (78.3%) SAFV/EV71 co-detected patients developed severe HFMD, significantly higher than that of patients with EV71 single detection (78.3% vs. 42.6%, P = 0.001). By contrast, there was no significant difference between patients with CVA16 single detection and patients with SAFV/CVA16 co-detection (P> 0.05). Similarly, no difference was attained for other EVs co-detected patients either.",

For the Chinese lineage, an obvious geographic-specific distribution was observed, with strains from three locations grouped separately into three sublineages. All the SAFV-1 cases from the current study were grouped into the Chongqing sublineage, regardless of the cohort group. In SAFV-2, five lineages were constructed, which included European, North American, Middle-Eastern, Japanese, and East Asian lineages (Figure 2B). The strains from the present study were grouped into East Asian lineage, which, however, diverged from those from Beijing or Thai strains. In SAFV-3, six lineages were formed depending on the geographical origin. The Chongqing strains in this study were classified into the Asian lineages, forming a sublineage that was distinct from the strains of other regions (Figure 2C). In SAFV-6, the strains from three locations were classified into three clusters. The Chongqing strains formed a separate cluster, which is different from those of Japanese and Pakistani strains (Figure 2D).",

On the other hand, although the HFMD cohort was tested using stool, respiratory, blood, and CSF samples, an over-estimation of infection rate was not generated, because stool samples offered the highest diagnostic sensitivity. When we took no account of the patients with stool negative while other sample types are positive, a prevalence rate of 3.1% was still obtained. Thus, this effect alone might not explain the higher prevalence observed in HFMD.",

The co-detection of SAFV with other viruses ranged from 0% to 100% in previous studies, and the variation in results is probably due to different diagnostic assays applied910111213141516171819. In the present study, 15 common respiratory viruses in ARTI patients, 9 common viruses in diarrhea patients, and all EVs in HFMD patients were detected. The current results might represent a higher probability of single infection than the previous studies. Still, single-infection by SAFV is only true relative to the list of viruses that are being tested. Second, this study also revealed the negative detection of SAFV in healthy children, indicating that SAFV is less likely to be present in asymptomatic subjects. This result is consistent with a previous study that was conducted among 39 asymptomatic patients in northern Germany11. Finally, more severe clinical outcome and manifestation of nervous system were exhibited by SAFV-positive HFMD patients than in SAFV-negative HFMD patients.",

However, an etiological diagnosis was reached in less than 50% of the cases despite the use of modern microbiological and radiological methods3537. The list of uncommonly observed etiological agents for pediatric encephalitis remained far from complete. Animal experiments have suggested that SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 can cause serious invasive infections and are neurotropic in mice3839. Hertzler et al. reported that high doses of SAFV-2 intraperitoneally inoculated into adult mice resulted in paralysis and neuropathological changes consistent with acute encephalomyelitis, particularly in the limbic system38. Sorgeloss et al. showed that both SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 can infect the heart and the central nervous system of 129/Sv mice39. Furthermore, they found that SAFV-3 was more neurotropic than SAFV-2, and intracerebral inoculationof SAFV-3 into FVB/n mice caused acute encephalitis39. In the current study, the existence of SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 was observed in the patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis. The present results, together with those of the earlier studies, indicate that SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 might play a role in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis.
