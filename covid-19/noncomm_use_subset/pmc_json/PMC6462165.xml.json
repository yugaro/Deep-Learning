CS-modified cisplatin displayed improved anti-cancer activity and reduced drug toxicity.3 CS-modified glucocorticoids can prolong the release time of the drug in vivo and enhance the efficacy, without toxicity or side effects.4 In addition, CS is also a ligand of CD44, which can specifically target the CD44-overexpressed tumor cells.5\u20138",

We have studied the bioactivity of ES2 and found that it could effectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.9 A VEGFR1-selective hexapeptide (GNQWFI, AF) was selected from a Position Scanning Synthetic Peptide Library, which can specifically bind to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby inhibiting the interaction of VEGF with a series of ligands. Although the AF peptide cannot directly inhibit the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, it can significantly inhibit the binding of VEGF to the receptor, thereby blocking the pathway of neovascularization.6,7,10 However, the AF peptide contains three hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and isoleucine) that lead to poor water solubility, thus restricting their applicability.11\u201313",

Polypeptides and protein drugs are easily degraded in plasma, tissues, and cells by various metabolic enzymes in the body, resulting in their poor stability and a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we used CS to chemically modify ES2-AF to improve the shortcomings of peptide drugs in this study. We hoped that the addition of CS could increase the tumor tissue-targeting ability of these drugs and increase their efficacy in vivo.14\u201316 The structural confirmation of the ES2-AF derivative (CS-ES2-AF) was performed using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), and the morphology and stability of the conjugates were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and particle size and zeta potential analyzer. The anti-angiogenic ability of CS-ES2-AF on endothelial cells was studied using MTT, migration, tube formation, and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays in vivo and in vitro. Targeting studies with CS-ES2-AF were performed by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and in vivo bio-imaging. The pharmacokinetics of the drugs was also studied.",

The small particle size, as well as the uniform size distribution of the CS-ES2-AF nanoparticles, was suitable for the development of nanomedicines. The zeta potentials of CS-ES2-AF and ES2-AF were -34.00\u00b14.53 mV and \u22127.50\u00b14.07 mV, respectively, indicating that the conjugation with CS enhanced the stability of ES2-AF in the system. Based on this result, we can conclude that CS-ES2-AF can self-assemble into well-stabilized nanoparticles in aqueous solution. This structure enables the peptide to be encapsulated in the CS-formed nanoparticles, avoiding the loss of activity caused by protease hydrolysis.39\u201341 Studies have shown that CS can specifically bind to CD44 on the surface of tumor cells; the presence of CS-ES2-AF nanoparticles enables CS to act as a targeting vector to carry ES2-AF to the surface of tumor cells, thereby indicating that ES2-AF can play a better role in anti-angiogenesis.5",

Compared to small molecule drugs, polypeptide drugs often have poor aqueous stability due to their spatial structure. When the anti-angiogenic peptide ES2-AF was modified with CS, the stability of the conjugate in aqueous solution improved. This is due to the fact that the CS group in the aqueous solution forces the water molecules around the ES2-AF polypeptide to enhance the stability of ES2-AF. Therefore, it can be inferred that the higher the concentration of CS, the better the stability of ES2-AF. In addition, the results of the MTT assay are also related to the state of endothelial cells and the degree of differentiation.

When the ligand protein CD44 is coupled to the chip surface, it is necessary to dissolve the protein in a buffer solution with pH lower than its isoelectric point and higher than pH 3.5, so that the protein surface is positively charged, and the carboxyl groups with negative charges on the chip surface are combined by electrostatic adsorption. The isoelectric point of CD44 was pH 5.15, so the optimum pH value of CD44 protein solution was 3.8 after screening. The samples were dissolved in PBS buffer and diluted with running buffer (50 mM phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 0.01% vol/vol Tween 20, pH 7.4). Then, different concentrations of the sample were flowed through the surface of the chip immobilized with the CD44 receptor protein and the Kd values were obtained by Biacore T2000. In general, when the value of KD was in the range of 10\u22125\u201310\u221212, it meant that the sample had a strong affinity with the ligand protein.33 Because CS is the ligand of CD44 receptor and can specifically bind to CD44 receptor, it had a stronger affinity toward CD44 receptor than the unmodified ES2-AF. Therefore, CS was used to modify ES2-AF to improve the targeting of drugs to tumor tissues.",

Second, it can be continuously observed for a period of time, and dynamic experimental results and intuitive drug distribution images can be obtained, so that the experimental results can be seen at a glance. Finally, it is a non-invasive and painless detection technology of biological behavior in vivo, which complies with the requirements of experimental ethics.

Glycosylation also increases the stability of the conjugates in blood.

At present, the US FDA uses the pharmacokinetic data obtained by radioisotope determination of peptide drugs for the effective evaluation of the safety of the drugs. However, polypeptides labeled with radioisotopes, such as 125I are prone to be labeled off-label during the experiment, as they are unable to accurately reflect the concentration of the polypeptide drugs from the measured radioactivity. This method also has the shortcomings of radioactive contamination, thus limiting its application in clinical pharmacokinetics research. Although ELISA method is simple and convenient to operate, it is necessary to develop related antibody-coated kits. The preparation period of the kit is not long and it is not susceptible to interference by biological endogenous and exogenous substances during the measurement process. The LC/MS has the advantages of good specificity and high sensitivity. However, plasma samples contain a large amount of salts and endogenous proteins, which may interfere with the measurement process. Fluorescence labeling has been used by increasing number of people because of its mild reaction conditions and simple detection method.",

In this study, FITC was used to label ES2-AF. FITC could be linked to several amino acids in the ES2-AF peptide chain.

The results showed that CS-ES2-AF had better ability to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of endothelial cells than ES2-AF. Then, the binding ability of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF in vitro and in vivo was studied. ELISA results showed that the glycosylation-modified product CS-ES2-AF inhibited the binding ability of VEGF to its receptor, better than the peptide ES2-AF; SPR results showed that the binding ability of CS-ES2-AF to CD44 receptor was better than that of ES2-AF; in vivo imaging experiments showed that the distribution of CS-ES2-AF in tumor-bearing nude mice was targeted. In addition, bioimaging results showed that CS-ES2-AF had a longer metabolic time compared to ES2-AF in vivo, which may be due to the increased stability of CS-ES2-AF in plasma. That was consistent with the in vivo half-life experiments. The half-life of CS-ES2-AF was approximately threefold longer than that of ES2-AF. These data strongly suggest that CS has the desired effect of extending the half-life of this peptide drug.",
