            "text": "The genus Pneumocystis contains highly diversified and opportunistic fungal species that cause severe pneumonia in mammals with a deficient immune system.1 In the veterinary literature, there are many published cases of confirmed canine pneumocystosis\u2014most of which described cases of young to middle-age dogs with suspected immunodeficiency, with the Miniature Dachshund, and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breeds most commonly reported.1\u20138 Concurrent infection with other pathogens has been reported in only a few cases when concurrent Demodex canis3,5,7 and canine distemper virus (CDV)3 infections were demonstrated. In most of the previously reported veterinary cases, in vivo diagnosis of Pneumocystis spp. pneumonia (PP) was achieved by direct identification of the microorganism by cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, trans-tracheal aspirates, or transthoracic lung aspirates.2 However, using this technique, the diagnosis can be missed due to failure on detection of the lung pathogen.2,4,6,9 In human medicine, several studies have demonstrated that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods increase the sensitivity of detection of the organism compared to its direct identification on lung samples.10,11 Indeed, real-time PCR has been recently recommended for PP diagnosis by a European panel of experts.12",

The dog was not vaccinated and had not received any heartworm prophylaxis in the previous 3 months. Consecutive antibiotic treatments with appropriate doses of doxycycline, metronidazole\u2013spiramycin, and finally, a 10-day course of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid all had all failed to resolve or even improve clinical signs. Antibiotic treatment was discontinued 4 days before presentation. Two previous fecal Baermann\u2019s tests were negative for Angiostrongylus vasorum. PCR testing of a nasal swab for CDV, adenovirus 2 (CAV-2), herpesvirus 1, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (CPiV), and respiratory coronavirus was also negative. On presentation, the dog was bright and alert, mildly tachypneic (40 r/min) with a bilateral mucous nasal discharge. The remaining physical examination was normal. A blood sample was taken for a complete blood count, including blood smear examination, serum biochemistry, and serum electrophoresis, and for a coagulation profile. Urinalysis was performed on a urine sample obtained via cystocentesis. Right lateral and dorso-ventral thoracic radiographs were also taken. Clinicopathological abnormal findings included a mild non-regenerative, normocytic normochromic anemia (5.27 \u00d7 1012/L; reference interval, 5.81\u20137.12), leukocytosis (35.8 \u00d7 109/L; reference interval, 8.33\u201314.79) with neutrophilia (24.3 \u00d7 109/L; reference interval, 4.0\u20138.1), lymphocytosis (10.0 \u00d7 109/L; reference interval 2.1\u20134.9), and monocytosis (1.0 \u00d7 109/L; reference interval, 2.9\u20137.0). On blood smear examination, there were activated lymphocytes and toxic neutrophils. Serum biochemical profiles showed an increase in serum C-reactive protein (6.9 mg/L; reference interval, 0.1\u20130.6), a mild hypoalbuminemia (27 g/L; reference interval, 29\u201333), and a mild hypoglobulinemia (21 g/L; reference interval, 24\u201332). Serum immunoglobulin fraction quantification showed a decreased immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration (0.58 g/L; reference interval 0.9\u20133.72), while immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations were at the lower limit of the reference intervals (0.79 g/L; reference interval, 0.76\u20131.8 and 0.018 g/L; reference interval, 0.001\u20130.09; respectively). Serum globulin quantification was in agreement with those detected by micro-capillary electrophoresis diagram (Table 1 and Figure 1). Rod-shaped bacteria and pyuria were detected with urine sediment examination and therefore urine culture was performed. All the remaining clinicopathological tests were normal. The radiographs of the thorax showed a mild diffuse bronchial pattern (Figure 2(a) and (b)).",

Flow by 100% oxygen delivery was provided during the entire procedure until the dog was fully recovered. A small flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was used. Pulse oximetry, electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure were monitored throughout the procedure. A diffuse, productive bronchopathy and a non-specific mucous-productive rhinopathy were identified. BAL was performed by instilling two aliquots of 5 mL of warmed sterile 0.9% saline by syringe, followed by approximately 5 mL of air to clear the fluid from the endoscope channel before the saline was aspirated. The BAL sample was immediately submitted for cytological analysis and bacterial culture.",

To investigate the presence of Pneumocystis spp., a portion of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA gene (mtSSU rRNA gene) was amplified and sequenced by nested PCR with previously reported primers and protocol.13 Cytological examination of the BAL fluid revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with the presence of intracellular coccobacilli bacteria. Urine culture and BAL fluid culture were positive for Escherichia coli (1,000,000 CFU) and Klebsiella pneumonia, respectively. Both microorganisms were sensitive to all antibiotic molecules tested on the antibiogram, and, surprisingly, included those used up to 4 days before presentation (i.e. amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid). Polymerase chain reaction testing of BAL fluid was positive for B. bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. Pneumocystis identity was confirmed by sequencing of the mtSSU rRNA amplicon. The unroot phylogenetic tree constructed using mtSSU rRNA sequences showed that Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis was distinct from Pneumocystis spp. isolated from other animals, confirming that this was the specific species related to canine hosts (Figure 3).",

Dogs with chronic inflammatory disease (such as chronic septic pneumonia as in this case) often present with hypergammaglobulinemia and normal-to-high IgG concentration.14 The decreased gammaglobulins and IgG concentrations identified in this patient, together with the IgM and IgA in the lower limits of the reference intervals, were highly suspicious of an immunocompromised state, in agreement with previously reported cases of PP in CKCS.15,16 Alternatively, the lack of vaccinations in this dog may has contributed to the low serum concentrations of gammaglobulins and IgG concentrations,17 since reference intervals are derived from vaccinated animals.",

The imbalance between the different lifecycle forms of Pneumocystis spp. might explain the lower diagnostic yield of cytology in certain instances, as cysts are much easier to distinguish than trophic forms using rapid, modified Romanowsky stains such as Diff-Quik. Such an explanation might account for why some specimens can be PCR-positive, yet no organisms can be detected using conventional light microscopy.2,4,6,9 Similar to humans, PCR method to achieve a PP diagnosis has been suggested in dogs,4,18 but it has only recently been used ante-mortem.8,9 These recent studies confirm that PCR testing can be a valid diagnostic test for the detection of Pneumocystis spp. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis of the Pneumocystis spp. nucleic acid amplified from BAL fluid in the current study showed that it was a specific canine host\u2013related species.",
