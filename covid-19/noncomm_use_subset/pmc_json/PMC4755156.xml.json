            "text": "Plaque formation in the CNS of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has been appreciated for over a century; however, how discrete plaques are restrained is poorly understood. Demyelination with no evidence of T cells as an early event in MS (Barnett and Prineas, 2004) and expanding lesions with little or no T cells in autologous bone marrow recipients (Metz et al., 1994) both suggest expansion may be regulated by intrinsic pathological processes. The focal nature of white matter lesions in MS patients is also observed in rodents with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), spinal cord injury, and demyelination induced by gliatropic coronavirus infection (Bender and Weiss, 2010; Bergmann et al., 2006; Liedtke et al., 1998; Okada et al., 2006; Voskuhl et al., 2009), supporting a conserved regulatory mechanism that restrains lesion expansion. Astrocytes are implicated as a critical component, as glial scars formed by reactive astrocytes demarcate injured areas following trauma, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disease, and autoimmune disease, thus shielding adjacent healthy tissue from bystander damage (Cregg et al., 2014; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Ablating astrocyte intermediate filaments or inducing apoptosis of dividing astrocytes attenuates gliosis as well as formation of discrete demyelination foci (Liedtke et al., 1998; Toft\u2010Hansen et al., 2011). Similarly, elimination of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)\u20103, required for signaling via interleukin (IL)\u20106, IL\u201010, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), specifically in astrocytes inhibits scar formation (Herrmann et al., 2008; Wanner et al., 2013). By contrast, abrogation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)\u20103 in astrocytes, thereby increasing STAT3 phosphorylation, limits lesion area, enhances astrocyte migration, and improves functional recovery (Okada et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010 also provides neuroprotection by ameliorating demyelination caused by neurotropic coronavirus (Trandem et al., 2011) and reducing encephalomyelitis caused by Sindbis virus infection (Kulcsar et al., 2014). Although IL\u201010 decreases tissue damage at the cost of limiting pathogen control (Chen et al., 2012; Couper et al., 2008b; Holscher et al., 2000; Kullberg et al., 2002), the contribution and mechanisms by which of IL\u201010 ameliorates pathology varies dramatically with the type of infection, the target tissue and source of IL\u201010 (Couper et al., 2008a, 2008b; Kullberg et al., 2002; Lund et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2011, 2009). IL\u201010 production at sites of inflammation commonly limits macrophage and dendritic cell maturation, resulting in suppression of T cell function (Couper et al., 2008a; Fahey and Brooks, 2010). However, during encephalomyelitis caused by glia tropic coronavirus designated JHMV, IL\u201010 deficiency increases demyelination and lethality, despite accelerated virus control in the CNS and quiescence of antiviral T cell function (Lin et al., 1998; Trandem et al., 2011). These outcomes represented an intriguing conflict, as delayed viral control generally correlates with enhanced demyelination in this model (Lin et al., 1999; Ramakrishna et al., 2002). Demyelination induced by sublethal neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus strains, including JHMV, require both oligodendroglia infection and adaptive immunity (Bender and Weiss, 2010; Bergmann et al., 2006, 2004; Wu et al., 2000). Lesions containing macrophages and microglia develop prominently after virus control (Bergmann et al., 2006; Templeton et al., 2008), but lesion formation is independent of both IL\u201017 and infiltrating monocytes, distinct from EAE (Kapil et al., 2009; Savarin et al., 2010; Xue et al., 1999). Furthermore, IL\u201010 is primarily secreted by CD4+ T cells within the JHMV infected CNS (Puntambekar et al., 2011), although IL\u201010 may be secreted by numerous cell types in other models (Couper et al., 2008a; Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010).",

            "text": "To better understand the cellular events underlying the protective effects of IL\u201010 on demyelination we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of viral control, persisting virus, and lesion formation in JHMV infected WT and IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice. Accelerated viral control in the absence of IL\u201010 initially resulted in limited demyelination. However, in contrast to relatively stable lesions with well demarcated borders in WT mice, lesion areas increased in the absence of IL\u201010 without evidence of viral recrudescence or altered cellular immunity. The expanding lesions exhibited ill\u2010defined borders and lacked elongated interdigitating processes associated with scar formation in WT mice, despite the presence of hypertropic astrocytes. In the absence of IL\u201010, lesions were also characterized by large foamy cells, axonal sparing, and a partial loss of macrophage/microglia exhibiting an acquired deactivation phenotype. Expanding lesion formation, temporally remote from the viral insult, is thus reminiscent of the epidemiological association of MS with an early insult, possibly an infection. Moreover, the data suggest a novel astrocyte dependent mechanism by which IL\u201010 contributes to stemming pathology within the CNS.",

Consistent with more efficient virus control in brain in the absence of IL\u201010, virus infected cells in spinal cord also appeared to be reduced (Fig. 1B,C). Moreover, similar morphology and distribution of virus infected cells indicated that viral tropism was not altered. Accelerated control of infectious virus in the absence of IL\u201010 suggested that viral persistence may also be reduced. However, although levels of the abundant viral mRNA encoding the N protein were reduced in IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT spinal cords at day 10 p.i., they were similar in both groups thereafter (Fig. 1F). IL\u201010 deficiency also did not alter the extent or distribution of inflammatory foci in spinal cords (Fig. 1D,E). CNS recruitment of CD45hi inflammatory cells was examined to support the notion that the anti\u2010inflammatory properties of IL\u201010 (Couper et al., 2008a) did not alter cellular infiltrates. Indeed, IL\u201010 deficiency did not affect the accumulation of inflammatory cells at any time p.i. (Fig. 1G). Thus, despite an IL\u201010 dependent delay in clearance of infectious virus, IL\u201010 did not affect overall inflammation, viral tropism, or persistence.",

Indeed, IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels within the CNS were elevated in the absence of IL\u201010 (Fig. 2A). Virus specific CD4+ T cells within the CNS produce higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 as compared to CD8+ T cells (Phares et al., 2010), although CD8+ T cells are essential to control JHMV infection (Bergmann et al., 1999, 2004). To assess which T cell subset is responsible for enhanced IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels in the absence of IL\u201010, numbers and function of virus specific T cells within the CNS were analyzed. Although total CD4+ T cell numbers were similar in both groups at all times p.i., virus specific IFN\u2010\u03b3+CD4+ T cells were more abundant in the absence of IL\u201010 at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2A), when virus control was initially apparent. In addition, mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the IFN\u2010\u03b3 producing populations indicated CD4+ T cells from the CNS of IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice produced more IFN\u2010\u03b3 at the cellular level (Fig. 2B). To confirm that increased IFN\u2010\u03b3 was mainly attributable to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells were also analyzed. Neither the number of virus specific CD8+ T cells detected by S510/H\u20102Db tetramer staining (Fig. 2C), the percentage of virus specific CD8+ T cells secreting IFN\u2010\u03b3, nor their relative MFI (data not shown) were altered in the absence of IL\u201010. Similarly, CD8+ T cell cytolytic activity, also contributing to virus control (Bergmann et al., 2004), was similar (Fig. 2D). Overall, these data support the notion that IL\u201010 primarily inhibits control of infectious virus within the CNS by suppressing IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion specifically by CD4+ T cells, albeit without affecting the level of viral persistence or CD8+ T cell function.",

Lesion area within spinal cords of infected WT mice increased \u223c2\u2010fold between days 14 and 21 p.i. and then remained relatively stable (Fig. 3B).

These data contrast with the focal demarcated and relatively stable lesion area in WT mice between days 21 and 31 p.i. (Fig. 3B). Kinetic analysis of lesion area and percentage demyelination thus both revealed that increased demyelination in infected IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice is initially preceded by less demyelination.

Although IL\u201010 is associated with an acquired deactivation phenotype (Mosser and Edwards, 2008), neither the relative expression of genes associated with repair following viral induced demyelination, nor the influence of IL\u201010 on these genes are well defined. To examine the influence of IL\u201010 on promoting a deactivation phenotype, we compared expression of CD206/mannose receptor associated with induction of deactivated macrophages (Martinez\u2010Pomares, 2012). CD206 expressing cells were initially present in the lesions of WT mice; however, their number declined as inflammation declined and lesion size stabilized. Interestingly, CD206+ cell numbers associated with lesions were increased in IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice at day 14 p.i. (Fig. 5A\u2013C), suggesting IL\u201010 independent CD206 induction. Subsequently however, CD206+ cells declined in both groups to below the level of detection (Fig. 5C). Loss of the CD206+ deactivation phenotype was thus not a marker for exacerbated tissue destruction in the absence of IL\u201010. Analysis of additional genes associated with the transitional decrease in activation showed that IL\u20101Ran mRNA expression in spinal cords was initially higher in IL10\u2212/\u2212 as compared to WT mice but subsequently declined in both groups (Fig. 5D) with a more pronounced drop apparent in IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice. Arg\u20101 mRNA expression, initially reduced in the absence of IL\u201010, declined similarly with time p.i., approaching na\u00efve levels by day 31 p.i. (Fig. 5E).

Despite similar inflammation and morphological evidence of microglia/macrophage activation (Fig. 1 and 2), initially reduced demyelination in IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice thus correlated with microglia/macrophages expressing an acquired deactivation phenotype, which was progressively lost, irrespective of lesion stability.",

Astrogliosis was thus analyzed by comparing the number and distribution of astrocytes associated with focal relative to expanding lesions. GFAP+ astrocytes were present both at the edges and within lesions of WT mice (Fig. 8A\u2013C,8G). Unlike the stellate morphology characteristic of resting astrocytes in uninvolved white matter (Fig. 8L), areas of myelin loss in WT mice exhibited increased GFAP expression and an organizational pattern consistent with scar\u2010like structures (Fig. 8A\u2013C). Furthermore, increasing astrocyte numbers per lesion area in WT mice from day 21 to 31 p.i. suggested an active repair response (Fig. 8G). By contrast, diffuse lesions in the absence of IL\u201010 were devoid of organized astrocyte formations at the lesion edges and the numbers of activated astrocytes were decreased (Fig. 8D\u2013F, G). Stable astrocyte numbers per lesion area in IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice supported a lack of proliferation due to the absence of IL\u201010 mediated STAT\u20103 signaling. This notion was supported by IL\u201010R induction on activated astrocytes associated with lesions (Fig. 8H\u2013K), but not on astrocytes in surrounding uninvolved white matter (Fig. 8H, L\u2013N). Indeed, no other cell type associated with the lesions including Iba1+ macrophage/microglia or CD3+ T cells expressed the IL\u201010R. Impaired astrocyte scar formation in the absence of IL\u201010 indicated that IL\u201010 confines focal lesions following viral induced demyelination via altering astrogliosis.",

However, the relative contribution of reduced T cell activity versus additional IL\u201010 mediated regulation of tissue resident cells to CNS pathology is less well explored. The data herein support the concept that IL\u201010 plays three distinct, yet overlapping roles in the JHMV model of viral induced demyelination. First, it selectively dampens CD4+ T cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, thereby delaying viral control and enhancing initial demyelination. Second, by limiting IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201010 not only deactivates microglia/macrophages but also dampens their pro\u2010inflammatory responses. Third, IL\u201010 signaling facilitates glial scar formation by astrocytes thus containing lesion size. The anti\u2010inflammatory consequences of IL\u201010 signaling in initially increasing demyelination are thus counterbalanced by a repair promoting activity apparent in microglia/macrophages as well as astrocytes. This in turn prevents lesion spread independent of residual persisting virus and sustained T cell mediated inflammation.",

Moreover, IL\u201010 selectively suppressed effector CD4+ T cells, as neither CD8+ T cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 production nor cytolytic activity was altered in the absence of IL\u201010. The absence of an effect on cytolysis is distinct from increased cytolytic activity associated with a subpopulation of IL\u201010 expressing virus specific CD8+ T cells (Trandem et al., 2011). Both IL\u201010 producing Treg and Tr1 cells are rapidly recruited into the CNS following JHMV infection, do not alter CNS inflammation, and decline but are sustained throughout persistence (Anghelina et al., 2009; de Aquino et al., 2014, 2013). Adoptive transfer and depletion studies suggest distinct roles of Treg and Tr1 cells in suppressing antiviral activity versus demyelination. Treg transfer during acute JHMV infection ameliorated clinical disease and immunopathology without altering viral clearance (Trandem et al., 2010). Similarly, Treg depletion during acute infection only transiently impaired infectious virus control coincident with a minimal increase in demyelination (de Aquino et al., 2013). By contrast, elimination of Tr1 cells during JHMV infection accelerated viral clearance and reduced demyelination (de Aquino et al., 2014). These data suggested that Tr1 cells are not the IL\u201010 source during chronic infection preventing sustained demyelination, contrasting with the results of CNS pathology mediated by parasites and autoimmune disease (Butler et al., 2013; Pot et al., 2011). Our data cannot rule out the possibility that the early increase in IFN\u2010\u03b3 inflicts increased and irreversible oxidative damage in the absence of IL\u201010 (Molina\u2010Holgado et al., 2001), which is progressively manifested at later time points. However, the similar increase in IFN\u2010\u03b3 coupled with reduced demyelination in the absence of Tr1 cells (de Aquino et al., 2014) supports to the concept that Tr1 cells are not the source of IL\u201010 preventing sustained demyelination.",

            "text": "JHMV induced demyelination requires both infection of oligodendroglia and antiviral cell mediated immunity (Bergmann et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2000). The lesions are defined by a mixed population of macrophages and microglia expressing both pro\u2010inflammatory and repair promoting genes, similar to lesion formation after spinal cord injury (Kigerl et al., 2009). However, the highly polarized Th1 immune response to JHMV coincides with only sparse IL\u20104 and IL\u201013 expression, preempting the transition to, or replacement of pro\u2010inflammatory macrophages by an IL\u20104/IL\u201013 dependent repair\u2010promoting phenotype evident following peripheral injury (Chen et al., 2012; Shirey et al., 2010). The limited induction of IL\u20104/IL\u201013 dependent populations nevertheless appears to be compensated by transition to an IL\u201010 dependent anti\u2010inflammatory microglia/macrophage phenotype, which augments remyelination through enhanced phagocytosis/clearance of myelin debris and/or oligodendrogenesis (Butovsky et al., 2006; Miron et al., 2013). The CNS lesion micro\u2010environment associated with IL\u201010 thus appears to ellicit a unique repair promoting microglia/macrophage phenotype, which restrains by\u2010stander immune pathology. Our data indicate that impaired activation of cells that support tissue repair in the absence of IL\u201010, combined with persistent pro\u2010inflammatory activation and the lack of a clear transition to an anti\u2010inflammatory phenotype contributes to progressive myelin loss. JHMV induced demyelination shares a variety of pathophysiological features with MS and EAE, but differs in two important aspects. First, the highly polarized Th1 response excludes T cells secreting IL\u201017 (Kapil et al., 2009; Savarin et al., 2012). Second, viral induced demyelination is independent of bone marrow derived macrophages (Savarin et al., 2010; Xue et al., 1999). This is supported by the continuous decline in activated macrophages within spinal cords in both infected WT and IL\u201010\u2212/\u2212 mice as well as sustained microglial, but not macrophage activation associated with the expanding lesions in the absence of IL\u201010. This contrasts the concerted effort of macrophages stripping myelin with microglia phagocytizing myelin debris during EAE (Yamasaki et al., 2014). Pathologically similar tissue damage, i.e., demyelination, can thus be affected by distinct mechanisms during viral and autoimmune induced lesion formation. Irrespectively, the focal nature of demyelination following distinct CNS insults, many of which are associated with increased IL\u201010 (Weiner and Selkoe, 2002), support a conserved mechanism that involves astrocyte activation and glial scar formation to limit CNS damage (Cregg et al., 2014; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Focal demyelinated lesions are characterized by increased expression of GFAP indicative of an astrogliotic scar (Silver and Miller, 2004). Induction of EAE in GFAP\u2212/\u2212 mice (Liedtke et al., 1998) or ablation of proliferating astrocytes supports the critical role of astrogliosis in the formation of discrete white matter lesions and the concept that astrocytes not only regulate glial scar formation, but also limit inflammatory cell invasion into the CNS parenchyma (Toft\u2010Hansen et al., 2011; Voskuhl et al., 2009).",

Moreover, by binding their respective receptors, IL\u201010, IL\u20106, LIF, and CNTF all activate STAT3 (Schindler et al., 2007), supporting a contribution of IL\u201010 induced STAT3 activation to the formation of focal lesions following viral induced demyelination. Indeed, in a spinal cord injury model, STAT3 ablation specifically in astrocytes resulted in lesion expansion, coincident with inhibited astrocyte migration and formation of a distinct lesion border, as well as increased macrophage infiltration (Wanner et al., 2013). A critical role of STAT3 signaling in regulating astrocyte function is also supported by spinal cord injury in mice in which SOCS3, which inhibits STAT3 signaling, was specifically ablated in astrocytes. Conditional disruption of SOCS3 signaling increased astrocyte migration, lesion confinement and functional recovery (Okada et al., 2006). The present data thus expand the regulation of autoimmune mediated demyelination and spinal cord injury by restricted expression of IL\u201010R and potential STAT3 signaling in astrocytes, to include viral induced demyelination. Lesion expansion, despite accelerated clearance of a subacute viral infection, is further reminiscent of epidemiological data implicating an elusive environmental agent in the pathophysiology of MS (Fujinami et al., 2006). Overall this model defines multifactorial events by which IL\u201010 limits CNS damage subsequent to viral control and supports the concept that IL\u201010 signaling to astrocytes regulates the formation of the glial scar surrounding and limiting areas of demyelination.",
