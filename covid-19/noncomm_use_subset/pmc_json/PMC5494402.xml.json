It may result from alterations in one or more levels of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis and glucocorticoid metabolism pathways or from decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and tissue response to corticosteroids 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, its multifactorial pathophysiology is only partially understood, and there is no absolute consensus regarding criteria for the diagnosis of CIRCI in either human or veterinary medicine.

In most veterinary publications, evaluation of HPA\u2010axis impairment was based on delta cortisol values (the difference in cortisol concentrations before and after administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) 10. Lower delta cortisol values and higher free cortisol fractions were reported in six dogs with septic shock compared to healthy controls 11. In one study, dogs with severe trauma, sepsis or gastric dilation\u2010volvulus were found to have decreased delta cortisol values compared to controls. Furthermore, dogs with lower delta cortisol values were more likely to receive vasopressors 12. In another report, both hypotension and decreased survivals were found to be associated with lower delta cortisol values in septic dogs 13. Decreased delta cortisol levels were additionally reported in a small population of critically ill cats 14. Despite such reports in the veterinary literature, current recommendations in human medicine do not support use of the ACTH\u2010stimulation test to identify patients with CIRCI requiring corticosteroid treatment 4, 9, 15. Instead, CIRCI is suspected when fluid therapy and vasopressor\u2010resistant shock (usually failure to maintain SAP > 90 mmHg or MAP > 65 mmHg) are responsive to hydrocortisone administration 4, 15, 16. Likewise, the diagnosis of suspected CIRCI in the cat in the present report was based on clinical findings and response to therapy.",

Additionally, one abstract reports a prospective blinded placebo\u2010controlled study in eight dogs treated with either hydrocortisone or an equivalent volume of saline, but results were inconclusive due to the small number of dogs enrolled 19. While intermittent and CRI administration of hydrocortisone appear to be equally effective in people with CIRCI, dexamethasone is not recommended due to its prolonged suppression of the HPA axis 4. Although different hydrocortisone treatment regimens have been reported in both veterinary and human medicine 3, 4, 9, 10, 20, the ultimate goal of therapy is to provide doses of hydrocortisone adequate for the needs of the patient.

Similarly, the previously reported case of feline CIRCI was a cat with polytrauma 18. In addition, evidence of CIRCI based on ACTH\u2010stimulation testing was found in critically ill cats with neoplasia 25. Septic shock was likely the main cause of CIRCI in the cat reported here, but predisposing factors, including drug exposure should be considered 26, 27. Megestrol acetate administration has been associated with metropathies 28, 29, 30, and likely played a role in the development of pyometra in this cat. Moreover, MA administration may lead to reversible and potentially fatal HPA axis suppression in both humans and cats 31, 32, 33, 34, thereby implicating it in the development of CIRCI itself. However, adrenocortical recovery after MA administration (2.5 mg/cat q24 h or 5 mg/cat q48 h for 2 weeks) was found to only require 2\u20134 weeks 34, 35, 36. The cat in the present report received a similar dose and the last dose reported by the owner was 8 weeks prior presentation. Even if the owner was mistaken about the timing of the last dose of MA, basal cortisol would be expected to be <1 \u03bcg/mL in MA\u2010induced HPA axis suppression 34, but basal cortisol measured in this cat was elevated. Moreover, hydrocortisone therapy is considered necessary in people with CIRCI regardless of cause, and treatment response in this cat is evidence of CIRCI responding to hydrocortisone whether or not MA played a role in its development 33.",

Nevertheless, alfaxalone failed to induce HPA suppression in ovario\u2010hysterectomized sows as opposed to endogenous allopregnanolone in pregnant sows 39. Furthermore, alfaxalone was reported to increase cortisol levels in anesthetized rabbits 40, and an alfaxalone/alfadolone mixture has been reported to increase cortisol levels in rats and people 41, 42.

In the case described herein, necropsy revealed bilateral diffuse adrenocortical hyperplasia and hypertrophy, which has previously been associated with chronic stress 45, pituitary hyperadrenocorticism 46, 47, hyperaldosteronism 48, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia 49. Although ACTH\u2010stimulation testing is not considered useful during initial shock management, a convalescent ACTH\u2010stimulation test may, therefore, have been of benefit to investigate adrenal function in this case. The failure to perform an ACTH\u2010stimulation test when the cat presented for follow\u2010up examination is, therefore, a limitation of this report. Necropsy also revealed adrenocortical cytoplasmic vacuolization, which has been described in association with toxicosis 50 and MA administration 34. However, reversible adrenocortical atrophy rather than hyperplasia would be expected if vacuolization was due to MA or hydrocortisone administration 34. Whether the observed histopathologic changes were secondary to CIRCI or an underlying disease predisposing to CIRCI in this case remains unclear. Furthermore, as necropsy was performed 2 months after initial presentation, the observed histopathologic findings may be unrelated to the presenting sepsis, shock, or CIRCI. Indeed, no macroscopic adrenal changes were observed during laparotomy, although abdominal exploration may have been limited due to hypotension and the desire to curtail the duration of anesthesia.
