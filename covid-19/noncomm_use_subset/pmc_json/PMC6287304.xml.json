Recently, we have reported27 a simple and high-yielding synthesis of xanthine ANPs exploiting the MW-assisted hydrolysis of the corresponding 2,6-dichloropurine derivatives.

GCV, CDV, ACV, brivudin (BVDU), zalcitabine, zanamivir, alovudine, amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, dextran sulfate (molecular weight 10000, DS-10000), mycophenolic acid, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50, i.e. compound concentration required to decrease virus plaque formation (VZV) or virus-induced cytopathogenicity (other viruses) by 50%. While none of the compounds showed any activity against RNA viruses, compounds 4, 5 and 6 were able to inhibit the replication of herpesviruses (Tables 1 and 2). PMEX (4) emerged as the most active compound against VZV and HCMV, being as active as the reference drug ACV against the TK+ Oka strain (EC50 = 2.62 \u00b5M (PMEX) versus 3.42 \u00b5M (ACV)). In contrast to ACV, compound 4 remained active against the TK\u2013 VZV 07\u20131 strain (EC50 = 4.58 \u00b5M). PMEX also inhibited the replication of HCMV with EC50 values of the same order of magnitude as the reference anti-HCMV drug GCV, while PMEX had a 50% cytostatic concentration of 111 \u00b5M for HEL cells. Thus, compound 4 was not only potent but also selective as the calculated selectivity indices (ratio CC50/EC50) were of 24 and 42 (VZV 07\u20131 and Oka strains, respectively) and of 11 and 13 (HCMV AD-169 and Davis strains, respectively). Compounds 5 and 6 were, respectively, 6 to 12 folds and 3 to 8 folds less active than PMEX against VZV and HCMV. However, compounds 4, 5 and 6 inhibited the replication of HSV-1, HSV-2 and TK-HSV-1 at equivalent EC50 values in the range of 16 to 39 \u00b5M. PMEX (4) lacked activity against vaccinia virus, while HPMPX compounds (both S-isomer 6 and racemic mixture 5) were weak inhibitors of this poxvirus (EC50 = 39 \u00b5M, Table 2).",

            "text": "The inhibitory activity of the diphosphate form of PMEX (PMEXpp, 21) was evaluated in an enzymatic assay against herpes (VZV and HCMV) DNA polymerases compared to cellular (\u03b1 and \u03b2) DNA polymerases (Table 5). The inhibition of ACV triphosphate and the pyrophosphate analogue of foscarnet (PFA) were determined in this study for comparison. Compound 21 was not inhibitory towards cellular DNA polymerases, while it inhibited VZV DNA polymerase when dGTP was used as the competitive radiolabeled substrate (IC50 = 7.4 \u00b5M). However, no activity at the highest concentration of 21 (100 \u00b5M) could be detected against HCMV DNA polymerase when either dGTP or dTTP were used as the competitive radiolabeled substrates. These data suggest that compound 21 is a poor inhibitor of HCMV DNA polymerase or that the compound may require the HCMV DNA polymerase interact with other proteins of the replication complex to be active. It is also possible that PMEX or its metabolite targets another viral enzyme. To confirm that the compound targets the viral DNA polymerase, PMEX-resistant herpesviruses should be selected under the pressure of PMEX and characterized both genotypically and phenotypically.",

Two synthetic approaches were exploited for the synthesis of the target compounds: (a) recently developed MW-assisted hydrolysis of 2,6-dichloropurine derivatives and (b) well-established diazotization/2-hydroxy-dediazoniation of the corresponding guanine analogues. All prepared ANPs were tested against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two compounds exhibited antiviral activity. PMEX (4) was active against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 (with EC50 values between 2.6 and 25.6 \u00b5M), while HPMPX (both as S-isomer 6 and as a racemic mixture 5) exhibited moderate to weak activity (EC50 in the range of 17\u201343 \u00b5M) against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and Vaccinia virus. PMEX (4) was the most active compound against VZV in the series (EC50 = 2.62 \u00b5M, TK+ Oka strain) and was equipotent to the reference drug ACV (EC50 = 3.42 \u00b5M). In contrast to ACV, PMEX (4), as ANP which activity is independent of the first phosphorylation step, remained active against the TK\u2013 VZV 07\u20131 strain with EC50 = 4.58 \u00b5M. The hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative of PMEX, compound 18, slightly improved the anti-HSV potency of the parent compound (EC50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 \u00b5M). Further studies of PMEX (4) and of its diphosphate analogue PMEXpp (21) suggested that the compound acts as the inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerases (HSV-1 and VZV). This study represents the first report of xanthine containing ANPs with potent antiviral properties and urges further studies of various xanthine nucleotide analogues as potential antiviral agents.",
