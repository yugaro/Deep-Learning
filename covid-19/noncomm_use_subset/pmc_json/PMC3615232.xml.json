            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a major disease in the poultry industry worldwide. This disease frequently occurs in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks, and has caused severe economic loss over the last few years [11-14,17,21]. Protection failure is mainly due to the numerous IB virus (IBV) serotypes and frequent emergence of new variants [23,26]. Given the economic effects of IBV on the commercial poultry industry, preventing infection with this virus has been continually pursued. Traditional IBV vaccines include inactivated or live attenuated vaccines [2-4]. However, both types of vaccines have unique disadvantages. Inactivated vaccines can induce the production of relatively high antibody titers but a very low level of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses [5]. Live attenuated vaccines can initiate humoral and cellular immune responses, but lead to the spread the live vaccine viruses [7,15]. It is therefore necessary to develop novel vaccines and/or optimize current vaccination procedures.",

The S protein is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 protein is very important for inducing protective immunity and has been successfully used to construct IBV DNA vaccines [6,9]. The N protein is conserved and induces CTL as well as activated B cell responses, which are critical for preventing IBV infection in poultry [8,20]. The M glycoprotein can induce the production of detectable antibodies and delayed type hypersensitivity responses [8]. Hence, all of these proteins are primary targets for developing DNA vaccines to elicit immune responses.",

The virulent IBVSX16 strains used to challenge immunized chickens in this study were isolated from the kidneys of IB-infected chickens from the Shanxi province by Department of infectious Disease and immunology, College of Animal Science and Technology, Shanxi Agricultural University [21]. Virus stocks containing 1 \u00d7 103 egg infective dosage (EID50) of IBVSX16 with 100 \u00b5L were used to inoculate the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Shandong Specific-Pathogen-Free Chicken Research Center, China) that were then kept at 37\u2103 for 48 h. Allantoic fluid containing the virus was harvested after 48 h post-inoculation, stored at -80\u2103 until use. Chill eggs at 4\u2103 for at least 2 h to kill the embryo and to reduce the contamination of the allantoic fluid with blood during harvesting. Remove sticky tape and swab each egg with cotton wool soaked with 70% alcohol to disinfect and remove condensation from the shells. Dip the forceps or scissors in absolute alcohol and flame to sterilize. Remove the eggshell above the air space. Discard embryos that are visibly contaminated. Remove a sample of allantoic fluid from each egg. The 50% EID50/mL of the viral stocks were calculated as previously described by Reed and Muench [25]. Titer of the IBVSX16 strains was 109 EID50/mL. A total of 140 seven-day-old SPF chickens (Shandong Specific-Pathogen-Free Chicken Research Center, China) were housed in SPF environment at the Laboratory Animal and Resources Facility, Shanxi Agricultural University.",

Briefly, 2 mL freshly heparinized whole blood was diluted with Hanks' balanced salt solution in a ratio of 1:1 and carefully add on top of 2 mL lympholyte-mammal separation medium, centrifuge at 400 \u00d7 g/min for 20 min, aspirate coat of leukocyte, add 4 mL KPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, USA), centrifuge at 400 \u00d7 g/min for 20 min, discard supernatant and wash precipitation cell twice by the same method. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, USA), 100 \u00b5g/mL penicillin (Invitrogen, USA), and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. The freshly isolated PBMCs (106 cells/mL) were seeded in U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Costar; Corning, USA) and incubated with either 1 \u00d7 103 EID50 of IBVSX16 strain or 10 \u00b5g/mL concanavalin A (ConA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as a positive control, or RPMI-FBS alone in a final volume of 200 \u00b5L/well. Each blood sample was tested in triplicate. The microtiter plates were incubated for 48 h at 40\u2103 in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After incubation, 10 \u00b5L of an MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] solution (5 mg/mL; Sigma, USA) was added into each well. The plates were then incubated at 40\u2103 for another 4 h. The culture medium was removed by aspiration, and 100 \u00b5L of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, USA) were added to each well to lyse the cells. The absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm (A570) with an ELISA microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad, USA). Mean A570 values were used as indicators of peripheral T lymphocyte proliferation.",

The chickens were observed daily for 14 days post-challenge. Deceased chickens were necropsied and evaluated for IBV infection. The surviving chickens were euthanized humanely by pectoral muscle injection of ketamine hydrochloride in 22 mg/kg of body weight 14 days post-infection. The trachea and kidneys were collected for virus detection. The number of IBV-positive chickens was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All procedures for RNA isolation and RT-PCR were previously described [15]. Viral RNA was isolated and purified from trachea and kidneys collected from chickens challenged with IBVSX16 using Trizpl reagents (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of the specific fragments of N gene by RT-PCR was performed. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mL of DEPC-treated water. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan). The PCR reaction (50 \u00b5L) contained 1 \u00b5L of cDNA (about 100 ng), 5 \u00b5L of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer, 4 \u00b5L of 2.5 mmol/L dNTP, 2 \u00b5L of 10 mmol/L of each of the two primers, 0.25 \u00b5L of 2 U/\u00b5L Taq DNA polymerase, and 37.75 \u00b5L of H2O.

Findings from the present study agree with those of a previous investigation showing that all three IBV proteins selected for this study have their own unique and important roles in eliciting IBV immune responses [24]. The DNA vaccination with pVAX1-16M alone provoked the weakest immune response demonstrated by the lowest antibody titers (p < 0.01) in comparison with pVAX1-16S1 and pVAX1-16N. In contrast, pVAX1-16S1 induced the highest antibody titers among the three constructs.

The challenge assay also proved that the DNA vaccine targeting the N protein is more effective.

The inactivated vaccine as a booster is also considered to be able to balance the Th1 and Th2 immune responses [10], which could enhance both specific cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibody inductions with increased T cell response. In the current study, the DNA vaccine stimulated a relatively strong IBV-specific cellular response but low antibody titers. When the DNA vaccine and inactivated vaccine were administered in combination, both higher cellular proliferation rates and antibody titers were observed among the DNA vaccine-primed chickens as seen in previous studies [10]. Chickens that received the DNA vaccine with the inactivated vaccine were fully protected from IBVSX16 challenge. None of these animals developed clinical signs or harbored detectable levels of virus in the trachea or kidney after challenge.
