Notably, even direct intra-cardiac injections of naked AOs resulted in very low exon skipping.7 And although clinical trials with 2\u2032OMe8,9 and PMO10,11 chemistries have shown great promise, there is still a need for further optimization to improve AO delivery to all skeletal muscles and to the heart. This is critical as respiratory complications12 and cardiac dysfunction13 are the major causes of premature death in DMD patients. In particular the cardiomyopathy becomes clinically apparent at ~10 years of age, and is exhibited in all DMD patients by the age of 18.13,14 While some studies have shown that the restoration of dystrophin in respiratory muscles can improve cardiac function in the absence of restored dystrophin protein in the heart,15,16 there is concern that any improvement in skeletal muscle function in the absence of cardiac correction may worsen the cardiac disease progression due to increases in cardiac work load.17,18,19 It is therefore highly desirable that future therapies endeavor to restore dystrophin in cardiac as well as in skeletal muscles.",

Further optimization of this peptide series was carried out as conjugates to PMO, and Pip5e-PMO was identified as the most efficient peptide-PMO conjugate capable of inducing high levels of exon skipping and dystrophin restoration body wide, including in the heart, following a single dose intravenous administration.29 The Pip5e structure comprises a hydrophobic core region flanked on each side by arginine-rich domains containing aminohexanoyl (X) and \u03b2-alanine (B) spacers.

The results show that a core length of 5 amino acids (5-aa) appears to be essential for heart dystrophin production, since reductions in core length reduced cardiac activity. Unexpectedly, an arginine residue was tolerated in one position of the hydrophobic core, but two arginine residues were not tolerated, nor an arginine in a different position.

In contrast to the method of conjugation to the 5\u2032 end of PMO that we utilised previously,29 Pip6-PMO conjugates were prepared by conjugation of the 3\u2032 end of the PMO to the C-terminal carboxylic acid moiety of the Pip peptide (Figure 1b). We reported that there was no significant difference between the in vivo dystrophin production or exon skipping activity for Pip5e-PMO conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of the PMO or to the 5\u2032 end and therefore chose to utilise 3\u2032 end conjugation for these experiments.32",

This showed that exon skipping activity in cultured muscle cells was very similar for all these constructs, including Pip5e-PMO. These results differ from the previous Pip5 series,29 where the flanking arginine-rich sequences mostly contained a fixed number of arginine residues (10) but where spacings were varied through alternative placement of aminohexanoyl and \u03b2-alanine units. This resulted in small variations in exon skipping activity that correlated well with in vivo activity. In the case of Pip6 sequences, the flanking arginine-rich sequences are identical (with the exception of Pip6e, which is identical except for one arginine immediately preceding the core which is displaced into the second position of the core). The results demonstrate that cellular exon skipping activity does not depend on the sequence or length of the hydrophobic core. Note that we have previously shown that major changes in in vitro exon skipping activities are correlated instead with the total numbers of arginine residues.33",

Untreated mdx and treated mdx mice were normalized to C57BL10 mice. This method allows comparison of the staining intensity of dystrophin at the sarcolemma relative to laminin for each treatment group. Intensity ratios are normalized to C57BL10 samples and each region of interest at the sarcolemma (120 regions for each treatment group) is plotted on a scatter graph. The relative intensity values obtained for all four of the 5-aa core Pip6-PMO conjugates were significantly different to those of untreated mdx mice for the quadriceps and diaphragm (Figure 4b and Table 1). There were very similar dystrophin restoration levels in the quadriceps (percent recovery score\u2014%RS\u2014range between 21.10 and 33.44%; Figure 4b) and in the diaphragm for all treatments, with the exception of Pip6b which had a higher recovery score in the diaphragm (%RS range between 38.87 and 48.43%, Pip6b 56.72%; Figure 4b). All 5-aa core Pip6-PMO\u2013treated mice exhibited high dystrophin intensity values in the heart with the exception of Pip6e (other Pip6-PMOs were statistically significant compared to mdx = P < 0.0001; Table 1). Pip6a- and Pip6b-PMO conjugates displayed the highest recovery scores, as observed in Figure 4b (%RS 37.66% and 34.22%, respectively) closely followed by Pip6f-PMO (%RS 26.24%) and then Pip5e-PMO (%RS 17.32%). When directly compared to Pip5e-PMO treatment, only Pip6a-PMO was significantly better in the heart (Table 2). These 5-aa core Pip6-PMOs were also shown to restore other dystrophin complex proteins, namely neuronal nitric oxide synthase, \u03b1-sarcoglycan, and \u03b2-sarcoglycan as illustrated by immunohistochemical staining in the TA muscle (Supplementary Figure S4).",

Quantification of western blots has only recently been reported for dystrophin and currently uses chemiluminescence methods. It may therefore be judicious to give greater weight to the trends in dystrophin protein levels revealed by western blot rather than to the absolute values.

One might imagine that diminished efficiency of dystrophin restoration in the heart for Pip6c-PMO and Pip6d-PMO, with sequential amino acid deletions in the core, might be correlated with the resultant lower hydrophobicity and hence a reduced capacity to enter the cell.36 However, the in vitro results would suggest that all of these constructs are capable of entering the cells as they are all fully capable of exon skipping in muscle cells (Figure 2). Thus, the length of the 5-aa hydrophobic core must affect a different parameter essential for in vivo heart delivery. Enhanced uptake into whole heart slices of fluorescently labeled Pip5e-PMO, compared to B-PMO, suggested instead that crossing of another barrier (for example, the endothelial lining to the heart) is improved.30 Further heart studies are continuing with a Pip6-PMO that may help to address this issue. More surprising perhaps is that for Pip6c-PMO and Pip6d-PMO there was also some loss of dystrophin production in other muscle types. This suggests that the hydrophobic/cationic balance and/or the precise spacings of hydrophobic and cationic residues in the CPP impose more subtle effects on in vivo delivery parameters.",

These results provide evidence that the hydrophobic core of Pip peptides is unlikely to contain a particular amino acid sequence that recognizes a specific receptor in a membrane barrier required to penetrate heart tissue, but instead the core acts as a hydrophobic spacer of some kind.",

In the Pip-6e peptide, one arginine residue is moved into the hydrophobic core, which also results in alignment of a hydrophobic X residue adjacent to the core (X-YRFLI). One might have expected heart dystrophin production to have been completely lost in this conjugate, since a cationic amino acid (arginine) is now included in the core. By contrast, such heart activity was lost for Pip6h-PMO (X-ILFRY core) and the double arginine core conjugate Pip6g-PMO (X-YRFRLI-X core). Unexpectedly, dystrophin production was also lost in quadriceps and diaphragm for both Pip6g- and Pip6h-PMO. The unanticipated inconsistencies within the activity results for Pip6e, Pip6g, and Pip6h, and the losses of activities for Pip6c- and Pip6d-PMO, are perhaps best explained by the realization that precise spacings of the arginine residue within the Pip peptides with respect to both the outer hydrophobic amino acid spacers (X and B) and the inner hydrophobic core residues may drastically alter the pharmacological properties of each conjugate. This might occur not only through alteration in cationic/hydrophobic balance but alternatively due to secondary or tertiary structure changes of the Pip-PMOs, which could in turn affect serum protein binding or another parameter that alters the circulatory half-life, or which could affect the ability to traverse barriers required to penetrate muscle tissues. Such more subtle effects will require a more wide-ranging pharmacological and biophysical study, upon which we are currently embarking.",

The need for multi-mg synthesis of each conjugate as well as the availability of a large number of mdx mice has necessarily limited the scope of the current study. It is gratifying that even with the relatively small numbers of Pip6 conjugates tested, some interesting results have emerged and that several conjugates (Pip6a, Pip6b, and Pip6f-PMOs) have shown promising dystrophin production activities even beyond that of the previous candidate, Pip5e-PMO. Interestingly, analysis of serum samples from one of the 5-aa Pip6-PMO treatments, Pip6e-PMO, showed partial normalization of three miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206) to near wild type levels following a single, 12.5 mg/kg administration (Roberts et al., related manuscript37). This is greatly promising for the Pip6-PMOs, as it would not be considered the optimal peptide yet still demonstrated the significant therapeutic effect of this group of peptides.

For dystrophin visualisation and quantification, sections were co-stained with rabbit-anti-dystrophin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rat anti-laminin (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and detected by goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G Alexa 594 and goat-anti-rat immunoglobulin G 488 secondary antibodies, respectively (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Images were captured using a Leica DM IRB microscope and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described.16,34 A representative image for each treatment was taken. For quantification, four representative frames of the dystrophin and correlating laminin were taken for each section (n = 3) of the quadriceps, diaphragm and heart for each treatment. Using ImagePro software, 10 regions of interest were randomly placed on the laminin image which was overlaid on the corresponding dystrophin image. The minimum and maximum fluorescence intensity for 120 regions were recorded for each treatment. The intensity difference was calculated for each region to correct for background fluorescence and untreated mdx and treated mdx were normalized to C57BL10. These values were plotted on a scatter graph. The \u201crelative intensity means\u201d were calculated using a multilevel statistics model. Using these values, the percentage recovery score was calculated by implementing the following equation, as described on the TREAT-NMD website (http://www.treat-nmd.eu/downloads/file/sops/dmd/MDX/DMD_M.1.1_001.pdf): (dystrophin recovery of treated mdx mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice)/(dystrophin recovery of C57BL10 mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice). Staining of dystrophin associated proteins was performed as previously described29 using a MOM blocking kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and \u03b1-sarcoglycan and \u03b1-dystroglycan (Novocastra, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK) antibodies (1:100 dilution). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase staining was performed using a goat anti-rabbit antibody (Abcam).",
