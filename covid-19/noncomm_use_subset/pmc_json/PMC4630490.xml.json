His symptoms did not improve despite changing the antibiotics. As his fever continued and diarrhea developed, he sought another hospital (Hospital B) for treatment on May 25. Chest radiography showed faint infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. 1D). On May 27, chest infiltrates became more prominent and intermittent tachypnea developed.

            "text": "Sustained human-to-human transmission did not occur in the Korean outbreak of MERS-CoV, although at least 23 cases of fourth-generation transmission were confirmed (5). As of September 30, 2015, exported cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by 18 countries outside the Arabian Peninsula (3), but MERS-CoV has never been spread to more than a few other people in health care facilities in these countries (131415). The basic reproduction number R0 for MERS-CoV has been estimated to be less than 1, suggesting that the virus has not yet reached epidemic potential (16). However, a recent study suggested that cluster size over 150 cases should not be unexpected and there is substantial potential for superspreading events (17).",

One of the defining features of SARS-CoV transmission inside and outside hospitals was superspreading events (1920). Until now the lack of reported superspreading events due to MERS-CoV was a reassuring difference between MERS and SARS. This report clearly demonstrates that, as in SARS outbreak, superspreading events can cause a large outbreak of MERS in health care facilities. To prevent future international hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV, all health care facilities should establish and implement infection prevention and control measures as well as triage policies and procedures for early detection and isolation of suspected MERS-CoV cases.",
