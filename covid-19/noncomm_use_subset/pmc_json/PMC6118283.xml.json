Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis demonstrated that sLAMC2 level was significantly associated with DSS in PSCC patients at the T1/a, T2, and N0/X stages, and the cumulative 3-year survival rates were markedly lower in the high-LAMC2 group than in the low-LAMC2 group (T1/a: 50.0% vs 93.5%; T2: 47.4% vs 91.0%; and N0/X: 80% vs 91.1%) (Figure 3E\u2013G).",

Furthermore, sLAMC2 level was associated with N stage and pathologic grade in the analyzed patients. The relationship between LAMC2 level and N stage in PSCC patients was also supported by the results of our in vitro and in vivo experiments, which indicated that LAMC2 promoted PSCC cell metastasis. The effects of LAMC2 on PSCC cells may partially result from LAMC2-directed EMT in PSCC cells; this hypothesis is supported by previous reports showing that EMT endows cells with migratory and invasive properties.23",

These results may be in accordance with the lower HRs for tLAMC2, SCC-Ag, or CRP compared to those for N stage, pathologic grade, and sLAMC2 (Table S4). Thus, we speculate that sLAMC2 is a more important predictive factor for survival in PSCC patients than SCC-Ag and CRP, which have been previously reported to be potential predictive factors in PSCC patients. In particular, the stratification analysis revealed that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value for DSS in patients with early-stage penile cancer (such as patients at the N0/X stage). However, due to the lower number of patients at the T3/4 stage in our analysis, we cannot conclude that sLAMC2 level showed more predictive value in early T-stage penile cancer, and this finding needs to be further investigated in a large cohort.",

Next, prospective controlled clinical trials are also needed before this index can be brought into clinical use, especially for LN metastasis prediction and treatment monitoring. There are some limitations in our study: 1) only a small sample of PSCC patients from a single center was included, so selection bias is inevitable; 2) the number of patients at an advanced T stage (T3/4) or with LN metastasis (N+) was lower than the number of patients at the T1/2 or N0 stage, so we could not confirm that sLAMC2 level does not have predictive value for DSS in PSCC patients at a high T stage (T3/4) or with LN metastasis (N+); and 3) the diversity of adjuvant therapy may also affect the analysis.
