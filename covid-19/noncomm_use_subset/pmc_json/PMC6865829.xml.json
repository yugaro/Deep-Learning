            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus nonstructural protein-10 (SARS-CoV nsp-10) is the main transcriptase of SARS that cleaves polyproteins orf1a (187\u2013260 kDa) and orf1b (345\u2013422 kDa) during infection (1). Human embryo lung cellular protein interacting with SARS-CoV nsp-10 (HEPIS) is a novel gene that was previously isolated from a cDNA library of human embryonic lung tissue and the protein it encodes interacts with SARS-CoV nsp10 (2). The HEPIS gene is expressed as two different isoforms, isoform A and isoform B, which are 220 and 147 amino acids long, respectively (2,3). Previously, it was demonstrated that HEPIS is differentially expressed in ten different types of cancer, including stomach, liver, and prostate cancer (4). Furthermore, the transcription factors Oct-1, NF-\u03baB and C-Jun are associated with transcriptional regulation of the HEPIS gene (4). Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide (5,6), with the incidence of 92.8 per 100,000 women in western Europe in 2018 (7). Breast cancer progression is a complex process comprising cell cycle dysregulation (8) and metastasis to distant organs (9). A variety of steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone (10), and the expression of specific genes, such as zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 and matrix metallopeptidases (9), have been attributed to the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells. A previous study showed that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 regulates the expression of the p21 and CDK4 genes to promote breast cancer cell proliferation (11). Bone morphogenetic protein 6 has been found to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by targeting microRNA-192 and its direct target RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (12). Clinically, therapeutic interventions for the growth and metastasis of breast cancer remain limited. Our previous study demonstrated that the expression of HEPIS was significantly higher in T-47D compared with ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (4). However, the function of HEPIS in breast cancer cell proliferation has not yet been elucidated, and the elucidation of such a mechanism may provide novel approaches for therapy.",

To assess the effect of HEPIS on the proliferation of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the HEPIS-expressing plasmids pEGFP-C3-HEPISa or pEGFP-C3-HEPISb, and a CCK-8 assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the results of the CCK-8 assay indicated that overexpression of both isoforms of HEPIS in MCF-7 cells significantly decreased the cell proliferation compared with MCF-7 cells transfected with empty vector controls. To test the effect of knockdown of endogenous HEPIS expression on MCF-7 cell proliferation, three different siRNA plasmids which targeted human HEPIS were constructed (siHEPIS-1, siHEPIS-2 and siHEPIS-3), and the ability of these three plasmids to inhibit HEPIS gene expression using a DLR assay with the psiCHECK\u2122-2 vector was performed. The results revealed that HEPIS expression was lowest in cells transfected with siHEPIS-3 (Fig. 3B). Results of the qPCR analysis showed that overexpression of siHEPIS-3 significantly reduced the expression of HEPIS at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, the knockdown of HEPIS by siHEPIS-3 significantly increased the number of MCF-7 cells compared with the control, confirming that HEPIS has a growth-inhibiting effect on MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the results of the EdU proliferation assay revealed that overexpression of both isoforms of HEPIS decreased the number of cells in the S phase from 51.2 to 38.1% (HEPISa) or 36.3% (HEPISb) (Fig. 3E). In contrast, HEPIS knockdown resulted in a marked increase in the number of cells in the S phase, showing an increase from 47.1 to 63.8% (Fig. 3F). Based on the above results, it was confirmed that HEPIS inhibits MCF-7 cell proliferation.",

            "text": "Previously, the HEPIS isoform B has been identified as 147 amino acid long protein with several casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (2). In the present study, HEPIS isoforms A and B were both found to be expressed in MCF-7 cells. Of these, isoform A was the more abundantly expressed isoform. Similar to the present study, a previous study also showed that overexpression of HEPIS isoform B reduced the proliferation of HeLa cells (2). In the present study, it was demonstrated that overexpression of both HEPIS isoforms significantly inhibited cell cycle progression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inhibiting G1-S transition, and RNA interference targeting HEPIS exhibited resulted in increased cell cycle progression, confirming the potential role of HEPIS in the regulation of cell proliferation. Our group previously reported that HEPIS expression was significantly increased in four breast cancer cell lines: T-47D, ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 (4). In addition, the HEPIS expression levels were 8-fold higher in the T-47D cell line compared with that in the MCF-7 cell line (4). Cell proliferation is a complex process that is regulated by multiple genes, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 (8). The difference in expression of the HEPIS gene does not completely determine the growth rate of MCF-7 and T-47D cells. HEPIS in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma exhibits upregulated expression compared with adjacent normal tissue, whereas in rectal adenocarcinoma, the reverse has been observed; therefore HEPIS may possess varying functions in different types of cancer, due to each cancer having its own complex mechanism (4). In the present study HEPIS expression was down-regulated in breast cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue.",

This pathway plays a role in proliferation, migration and apoptosis (24,25), and disruption or dysregulation of this pathway can result in prostate cancer (26) or breast cancer (27). MAPKs are a highly conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and are involved in different cellular processes, such as proliferation, survival, apoptosis, differentiation, motility and development (28). ERK, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 are three major MAPK families that serve important roles in tumor progression in breast cancer (29,30). KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes, which were regulated by HEPIS, were functionally enriched in the MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.
