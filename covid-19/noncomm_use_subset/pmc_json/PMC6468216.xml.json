This finding highlights the very low rate of breast cancer screening and the need to intensify breast cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. In the United States (US), literate women are more likely to undergo a mammography.27 However, the rate of mammography is only 6.7% in Saudi Arabia compared with 72.4% in the US.8,28 Therefore, women empowerment is imperative for achieving the national goals of health education. Knowledge about breast cancer and its screening is still very poor among Saudi women. Therefore, awareness programs regarding the importance of breast cancer screening should be initiated more aggressively among Saudi Arabian women. The median age for colorectal cancer was 60 years for men and 55 years for women during 1994-2000 in Saudi Arabia and was 68 years for men and 72 years for women during 2004-2010 in the US.7,29 Therfore, it is recommended to begin screening of colorectal cancer in Saudi Arabia at the age of 40 years and it may be strictly implemented.28 The incidences of cancer in Saudi Arabia have reached a plateau recently, at least for colorectal cancer and the data supports this for the years 2010-2014. The increase in the number of reported cases of colorectal cancer in the last 5 years is merely due to an increase in the size of the population, but not an increase in the incidence rate which has fluctuated between 9-10/100,0000 and this is different from the rate in the 1990\u2019s.",

Moreover, there is more robust registration of cancer cases compared to the past when the registry was launched and the experience was small in this vital field. Finally, Saudis live longer now, which explains the rise in cancer cases and chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. As the population ages and the infertility rate drops with more women joining the work force and with increased financial burden of the large families and higher education of the married couple; the younger age groups will make a less portion of the society.

In 1989-1990, Saudi Arabia introduced a highly effective hepatitis B vaccination program in schools, through which all Saudi Arabian individuals aged \u226434 years (as of 2017) were vaccinated at birth or at school.

Therefore, it is important to implement effective nationwide measures for controlling brucellosis. In contrast to the decreased incidence of major preventable infectious diseases, the incidence of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, has increased in Saudi Arabia.

The rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes and obesity among the Saudi Arabian population may be attributed to distinct factors such as sedentary lifestyle with physical inactivity, irregular feeding habits, and intake of high-calorie foods and beverages.30,32 Therefore, a shift in attitude toward regular exercise, proper food habits, and physical activity in addition to appropriate health education from educational institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and corporates may be beneficial in ensuring better health of the Saudi Arabian population in the long run.",
