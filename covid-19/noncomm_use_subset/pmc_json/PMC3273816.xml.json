They can fold onto neighboring RNA hairpins to form pseudoknots, essential architectural RNA elements involved in ribosomal frameshifting (1,2), hepatitis C internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) recognition (3,4) and telomerase activity (5). Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is prevented or promoted by 3\u2032 addition of a polyadenylated tail, which recruits essential protein cofactors (6). Cleavage of the 5\u2032 transfer RNA (tRNA) leader by RNase P is a key step in tRNA maturation (7). In riboswitches, ssRNA links the ligand-binding aptamer domain to the expression platform, providing the basis for communication between the two (8\u201310).",

However, the atomic-level structural and dynamic behavior of these elements in the absence of these interactions remains unclear, in large part due to their high degree of flexibility. Several studies suggest that ssRNA polynucleotides adopt stacked and partially helical conformations, particularly adenine-rich sequences; however, the biological relevance of these structures is unclear (11\u201317). Atomic-resolution studies of ssRNA are scarce: at present only one isosequential ssRNA and ssDNA sequence has been characterized by homonuclear NMR methods and shown to possess properties reminiscent of A-form and B-form helices, respectively (18). Few MD studies have been performed on ssRNA, the majority of which use the AMBER force field (19,20) to explore the impact of chemical modifications such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and O2\u2032-methylation (21\u201324).",

            "text": "The class I prequeuosine riboswitch (queC), typically found in firmicute bacterial species, is commonly located in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the queCDEF operon, which expresses proteins directly involved in the queuosine biosynthetic pathway (25). The aptamer binds preQ1, an intermediate in queuosine synthesis, with high affinity to attenuate protein expression at either the transcription or translation level (25). This class has the smallest minimal aptamer domain (34 nucleotides, nt) discovered to date, consisting of a small hairpin followed by a 12 nt ssRNA tail (Figure 1A). Upon ligand recognition, the highly conserved adenine-rich tail condenses into a pseudoknot, forming a host of interactions to both the hairpin and ligand, including A-minor \u2018kissing\u2019 interactions between the ssRNA polyadenine tract and the minor groove (26\u201330). The activity of transcription-regulating riboswitches, such as the Bacillus subtilis queC riboswitch, has been shown to depend on the kinetics of ligand binding as well as the rate of transcription (8). Notably, the very small size of the queC riboswitch leaves very little time, in comparison to other switches, for ligand binding to take place prior to formation of the anti-terminator helix which, when formed, prevents terminator helix formation, thereby allowing gene expression to continue. For example, the B. subtilis FMN riboswitch, which is highly dependent upon the rate of polymerase and contains sites that locally pause polymerase to lengthen the ligand-binding window, has \u223c70 nt between the minimal aptamer sequence and complete formation of the anti-terminator helix (8). In comparison, the ligand-binding window for the queC riboswitch is \u223c20 nt (26,27). How efficient ligand binding is achieved is unclear given that the ssRNA tail is thought to be highly disordered, and therefore capable of sampling a wide range of competing conformations.\n",

IP-COSY experiments were performed at 277 K and 298 K to observe relative 3JH1\u2032\u2013H2\u2032 scalar coupling crosspeak intensities (45). Base and sugar 1H-13C splittings were measured from the difference between the upfield and downfield components of the 1H-13C doublet along the 1H component using the narrow transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) component in the 13C dimension as implemented in 2D 1H-13C S3CT-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments (46). 2H splittings were 71 and 69 Hz for WT and A29C, respectively. Idealized A-form structures were constructed using Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) correcting the propeller twist angles from +15\u00b0 to \u221215\u00b0 using an in-house program, as previously described (47). The complementary strand was removed and the resulting ssRNA used in NMR data analysis. B-form helices were constructed using W3DNA (48).",

Highly disordered residues are expected to have chemical shifts similar to nucleotide monophosphates (NMPs). While the chemical shifts of terminal residues are similar to their NMP analogs, increasing differences are observed when approaching the polyadenine core with the greatest differences observed for A30\u201332 (Supplementary Figure S2). The directionality of the chemical shifts is consistent with increased formation of stacking interactions towards the center of the tail (57). This is further supported by chemical shift perturbations in a trajectory toward the NMPs with increasing temperature (data not shown). Alternatively, addition of magnesium up to 4 mM results in slight chemical shift perturbations farther from NMPs, consistent with previous studies suggesting that increases in ionic strength stabilize ssRNA stacking interactions (59) (data not shown). In contrast polyU has near-identical (\u22640.1 ppm) chemical shifts to UMP (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, consistent with NOE data, the chemical shift data suggest a comparatively stacked core with a growing level of disorder towards the terminal ends. Normalized resonance intensities (33) further support these observations, which gradually increase towards the terminal ends, consistent with a higher level of pico- to nanosecond motions (Supplementary Figure S2).",

The measured R1 and R2 values were used to compute order parameters (51) using S2 = (2R2\u2013R1) (60), and normalized to yield a relative order parameter (S2rel) describing the relative degree of order within a molecule ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 represent minimum and maximum order, respectively. The S2rel values were normalized against central residues A31 (C8) and C33 (C6). Resonance overlap prevented the normalization of C2 spins.

Additionally, while experimental values have similar relative order parameters from A28\u2013C33, large variations are observed in the REMD simulation, with A29\u2013A30 being more ordered and A32 less ordered than experimentally observed (Figure 2B).

This makes it difficult if not impossible to assess the absolute level of disorder in the ssRNA; one can only make qualitative assessments about the relative disorder across different residues. However, it is noteworthy that even the comparatively high R2/R1 values measured in the rigid core (\u223c2.9, Figure 2C) remain significantly lower than values predicted for a perfectly rigid helical ssRNA (\u223c6.4, Supplementary Figure S4) as estimated using the program HYDRONMR (41,42). If we assume an overall diffusion tensor predicted by HYDRONMR, we find that central polyadenine residues are highly flexible with an estimated average NMR spin relaxation order parameter S2 of \u223c0.45 (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S4). Interestingly, similar though slightly smaller absolute S2 values are calculated from the REMD simulations (on average S2 \u223c 0.36 for core residues, Figure 2D). These data indicate that despite measurable stacking interactions and a helical-like average conformation, the polyadenine core is highly disordered with residues experiencing fluctuations on the order of a \u00b140\u00b0 cone angle (61) at pico- to nanosecond timescales.",

In the ssRNA, large base C\u2013H RDCs are measured in the polyadenine tract residues that gradually decrease at the termini (Figure 3A). Although small RDC values can also arise from static placement of the bond vector near the magic angle relative to the principal direction of order, the overall trends observed are consistent with NMR chemical shift and S2rel data suggesting that the RDCs indicate increased dynamic averaging at the termini (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the near-zero RDCs measured at terminal residues (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5) agree more closely to the REMD simulations compared to the S2rel values, indicating that the discrepancy between the measured and computed S2rel values may be due to truncation of the S2 sensitivity to motions faster than nanoseconds. These results add to a growing number of NMR studies on different types of RNA showing that RDC data are capable of probing motions that are incompletely sensed by spin relaxation due to truncation of the time-sensitivity by overall correlation time of the molecule (64,66\u201368). Unfortunately, severe spectral overlap, particularly pronounced in the Pf1 phage sample, prevented measurement of several C1\u2032H1\u2032 RDCs for the polyadenine core.\n",

Despite the relatively small number of RDCs used in this analysis, we clearly observe a better fit with an A-form geometry (Q-factor 4.77%) as compared to all other conformations (Q-factor \u2265 16%) (Figure 3B). This is consistent with independently observed 3JH1\u2032\u2013H2\u2032 scalar coupling crosspeaks, which indicate a C3\u2032-endo sugar conformation for core residues in the tail, suggesting an A-form (and not B-form) helical geometry. The RDCs are in strong disagreement with preQ1-bound X-ray and NMR structures (PDBID: 3FU2 and 2L1V) indicating that the tail must undergo a transition from an A-form helical geometry towards the distinct helical conformation observed in the X-ray and NMR structures in which the A-form geometry is perturbed at the hairpin-tail junction, likely due to torsional strain from the ssRNA folding back upon the hairpin. The REMD-averaged structure has a Q-factor of 30%, indicating a better fit than ligand-bound structures, but is still outside the range considered to represent a good fit. Together, these data suggest that, on average, the ssRNA tail adopts an A-form like conformation. The good RDC fit to the A-form structure also suggests that averaging of the RDCs due to internal motions is largely isotropic in nature, causing a semi-uniform attenuation of the RDCs relative to values expected for an A-form structure. The dynamics could involve exchange between a stacked ordered conformation and unstacked highly disordered conformation, or local isotropic motions about the average A-form conformation.",

These perturbations diminish when moving away from the center of the ssRNA and are basically absent in the highly flexible terminal residues (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S6). Such longer-range perturbations suggest that the mutation may have a long-range effect possibly by influencing the stacking interactions of several nucleobases. A perturbation to stacking interactions is also supported by distinct NOE connectivities in A29C, which show weakened cross peaks to C29, and new crosspeaks between A28 (H2) and A30 (H1\u2032) that indicate C29 partially loops out to allow A28 to stack onto A30 (Supplementary Figure S7). The melting temperature of the mutant is reduced by \u223c5\u00b0C, and the base stacking energies are computed to be \u223c2 kcal/mol lower compared to WT, indicating that the mutation likely destabilizes the stacking interactions (Supplementary Figure S6).\n",

This improvement is observed only for the REMD structure (Figure 4D), indicating that these residues, localized about the mutation site, adopt non-A-form conformations and likely experience perturbations from the increased dynamics at C29.

In the absence of ligand, the ssRNA tail is disordered but on average forms an A-form helix-like conformation, which can efficiently explore conformational space about a highly flexible junction. The ligand may transiently form encounter complexes when the tail is close in space to the P1 hairpin, and possibly with the help of divalent ions such as calcium (27,73), triggering the necessary conformational changes required to form the pseudoknot and binding pocket. This finding is consistent with computational modeling of the ligand binding mechanism in which A-minor tertiary interactions form first, followed by pseudoknot formation (30) and may explain the fast ligand binding rate observed in the related F. nucleatum queC riboswitch (52). Our results, including the observation of greater dynamics in the mutant, provide a framework for more rigorous testing of this proposed model with future in vitro and in vivo studies.\n",

Our RDC measurements on the ssRNA, together with scalar coupling constant measurements, strongly suggest that the polyadenine tract forms an A-form-like conformation in the WT ssRNA. Our results also unveil dynamic complexity in ssRNA, including a gradual increase in disorder occurring towards the terminal ends that is reminiscent of unfolded polypeptide chains (74), and also, slower sequence-specific dynamics occurring at micro- to millisecond timescales that may involve transient stacking/unstacking motions that may result in kinking of the ssRNA.

However, the REMD simulations showed weaker agreement with sugar RDCs or sugar conformation, particularly in the A29C mutant, and had increased dynamics compared to the NMR data. Prior studies on HIV-1 TAR RNA noted higher levels of dynamics in CHARMM simulations compared to NMR measurements (75). Our studies indicate that suboptimal base stacking energies may be a source of these excess dynamics. However, a quantitative assessment of the simulations requires the application of domain-elongation methods to rigorously decouple internal and overall motions, and make it possible to quantitatively predict NMR measurements (33,75\u201377). In addition, MD simulations that retain aspects of time are required to compare the rates of dynamics observed by relaxation and exchange broadening type measurements. The simplicity of ssRNA offers a much needed model system for such studies directed at rigorously examining currently used nucleic acid force fields.",

In particular, the pre-stacked ssRNA tail can efficiently rotate about a flexible hinge against the hairpin loop, and explore conformational space efficiently for rapid ligand binding. This pre-stacking about dynamic hinges may be a general feature of many ssRNAs that can play different architectural roles in a variety of RNA contexts.",
