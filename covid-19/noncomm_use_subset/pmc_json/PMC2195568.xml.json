PBMCs from 12 healthy HCV-seronegative, HLA-A2\u2013positive blood donors were stimulated with synthetic HCV core 178\u2013187, CYP2A6 8\u201317, or CYP2A7 8\u201317 peptide in four replica cultures. After 5 wk, the cultures were tested for CTL activity against target cells presenting each of the three peptides. Long-term stimulation with the HCV core 178 peptide induced HCV core 178\u2013specific CTLs in nine HCV-seronegative blood donors (Table ). In five individuals, the HCV core 178\u2013specific CTLs not only recognized the inducing HCV peptide but also CYP2A6 and/or CYP2A7 self-peptides. A higher specific lysis of targets presenting CYP2A7 was observed in most cases. Two donors recognized all three peptides, three individuals recognized HCV core 178 and CYP2A7 8\u201317, four recognized HCV core 178 only, and three did not show a CTL response after stimulation with HCV core 178. Representative results of three donors are shown in Fig. 2 a. These results as well as data obtained from CTL lines derived from positive cultures (data not shown) indicate the presence of three phenotypes of HCV core 178\u2013specific CTLs: CTLs recognizing HCV core 178 only, CTLs cross-reactive with HCV core 178 and CYP2A7, and CTLs specific for HCV core 178, CYP2A7, and CYP2A6. We did not find CTLs recognizing CYP2A6 without recognition of CYP2A7, nor cells recognizing one of the CYP peptides without recognition of HCV core 178. Importantly, no CTL response could be induced with the self-peptides CYP2A6 8\u201317 (Fig. 2 b) and CYP2A7 8\u201317 (Fig. 2 c) in any of the 12 donors tested. This fits with our observation of different MHC\u2013peptide interactions, because peptide-induced MHC stability and immunogenicity of the peptide are strongly correlated 28.",

Despite different MHC binding affinities and abilities to stabilize MHC complexes, all three peptides were recognized by CTLs with the same efficiency (Fig. 3 A). The higher off-rate of the CYP peptides had no effect on CTL recognition when the peptide-pulsed target cells were further incubated without peptide for up to 24 h before exposure to CTLs (Fig. 3 B). An explanation for this phenomenon could be the CD8 dependency of target recognition. Although lysis of target cells presenting HCV core 178 is markedly reduced by the anti-CD8 antibody OKT8, recognition of CYP2A7 is less affected and there is no effect on recognition of CYP2A6 (Fig. 3 C). These findings were unexpected but similar findings had been observed by al-Ramadi et al., demonstrating that the pattern of functional activities of variant peptides does not always correlate with MHC binding 31. In fact, other mechanisms involved in the interaction between the CTL and the target cell may be important, such as the TCR affinity for the MHC\u2013peptide-complex, and CD8 binding to MHC class I, as well as other costimulatory and cell adhesion molecules 32. To assess the role of CD8 binding on CTL\u2013target cell interaction, we used a panel of three different anti-CD8 antibodies and tested their effect on target cell lysis. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3 C using the OKT8 antibody. Although recognition of HCV core 178 depends in part on CD8 availability, self-peptide recognition of CYP2A6 does not. Further studies will be required to define the mechanism responsible for the discrepancy observed between peptide\u2013MHC binding and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.",

This indicates different T cell activation properties of the self-epitopes compared with the HCV peptide as described for altered peptide ligands (APLs), which are analogues of immunogenic peptides with amino acid substitutions inducing different effects in CTLs. APLs can act as agonists leading to full activation of T cells, partial agonists inducing only a reduced T cell response, or even antagonists inhibiting a response against the unaltered immunogenic epitope 33\n34. The molecular mechanisms of APL-induced partial T cell activation are still a matter of debate 35. Complexes of the native ligand or APLs with MHC molecules binding to the TCR can induce different intracellular signals in T cells 36\n37\n38, either by different oligomerization of necessary molecules (CD3, CD8, or other molecules), or by a failure of the APL to induce a required conformational change in the TCR. Other studies state that the level of T cell activation is dependent on the number of TCRs triggered in a process of serial engagement of many TCRs by a few peptide\u2013MHC complexes, allowing a single CTL to generate different biological responses 39. Although specific cytotoxicity is already detectable at very low peptide concentrations, IFN-\u03b3 production and proliferation require higher concentrations corresponding to higher numbers of TCRs being triggered 40. This is in accordance with the finding that the immunogenicity of antigenic peptides strongly correlates with the stability of MHC\u2013peptide complexes formed 28, indicating that a high number and a high stability of MHC\u2013peptide complexes is essential to trigger a sufficient number of TCRs to fully activate naive T cells. Despite this, the final effect of affinity differences or kinetic changes on the multimolecular interactions during antigen recognition cannot be predicted, as there is no strict correlation between functional activity of the various peptides and their MHC binding efficiency and the affinity of the MHC\u2013peptide complexes for the TCR 31.",

On the other hand, the HCV core 178 peptide that forms stable MHC\u2013peptide complexes is able to induce full activation including maturation of CTLs. In the activated cross-reactive CTLs, cytolytic functions can then be induced by the HCV peptide, and also by the CYP-derived APLs, as cytotoxicity requires a lower threshold of activation than proliferation. Once activated, a subpopulation of cross-reactive CTLs that shows no differences in recognition of the three peptide ligands, because they recognize the HCV core 178 and the CYP peptides at similar peptide concentrations, can be found.",

Moreover, the presence of autoreactive T cells in the blood and the liver of AIH type 2 patients has been demonstrated, indicating a role for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease 4\n5. Cross-reactive CTLs may contribute to liver cell damage by lysis of infected and uninfected hepatocytes during ongoing viral infection and by lysis of uninfected autoantigen-expressing hepatocytes after viral clearance. However, the presence of virus-inducible autoreactive CTLs alone is not sufficient to lead to typical AIH, as none of the tested HCV patients had markers for AIH (LKM-1 autoantibodies). Probably the presence of autoreactive CD8+ as well as autoreactive CD4+ helper T cells is required for the induction of AIH. LKM-1 antigen (CYP2D6)\u2013specific CD4+ T cells detected in AIH patients would be needed for the activation of B cells secreting the AIH marker LKM-1 autoantibodies. Furthermore, autoreactive CD4+ T cells could maintain the autoreactive CD8 T cell response after viral clearance, comparable with chronic viral infections where CD4+ T cells are essential for maintaining the CTL response 43\n44\n45\n46.",

            "text": "In summary, several arguments underscore the biological relevance of our findings. First, the viral epitope as well as the self-epitopes are naturally processed and presented by human host cells. Second, the self-epitopes and the viral epitope are coexpressed and colocalize to the liver in natural HCV infection, and expression of CYP2A6 is even enhanced in HCV-infected livers 47. Third, the absence of CYP-inducible CTLs in the peripheral blood suggests that central or peripheral tolerance mechanisms are operational, indicating that the self-epitopes are presented to T cells in vivo. Fourth, the data presented show a high level of cross-recognition of virally induced CTLs against the self-peptides, suggesting that they can mediate liver cell damage to uninfected cells. Fifth, another line of evidence links HCV infection to autoimmune hepatitis type 2 6. This disease has been described to occur subsequent to HCV infection 42 and, interestingly, in association with HLA-A2 48. Typically, it is associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed against cytochrome P450 2D6 3\n6, as well as autoreactive CYP2D6-specific T cells, suggesting the parallel occurrence of autoreactivity against cytochrome P450 at the level of B and T cells 4\n5. It can be hypothesized that liver cell damage mediated by virus-specific CTLs leads to the release of intracellular proteins like CYP2D6, uptake of these autoantigens by professional APCs, and autoantibody formation in the presence of autoreactive CD4+ T and B cells. After viral clearance, the autoimmune disease is upheld by ongoing hepatocyte lysis by cross-reactive, HCV-induced CTLs maintained by autoreactive helper T cells. The coincidence of HCV, autoreactive B cells, and autoreactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells is thus required for the induction of HCV-associated AIH. This would explain the relatively low frequency of AIH among HCV patients despite the high number of individuals with cross-reactive CTLs.",
