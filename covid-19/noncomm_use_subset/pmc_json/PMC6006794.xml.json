As a result, the efficacy of vaccines against influenza virus may become disrupted, and this phenomenon has sometimes caused pandemics [6]. In Japan, the first case of Zika virus infection was reported in 2016 [7]. Some cases infected with dengue virus were reported in 2014 after the virus had been absent for 70 years previously [8].

Vaccination against neonates is also being conducted and has shown a good efficacy [24]. Norovirus is also highly contagious and resistant to alcohol. For contaminated sites, it is recommended to wipe with bleach containing more than 500 ppm of chlorine [23]. Vaccines for norovirus are currently under development.

When LGG was administered for 4 weeks to children with gastroenteritis who were positive for either rotavirus or Cryptosporidium species in stool, a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels post-intervention was observed in children with rotavirus-induced diarrhea who received LGG. Among the children with cryptosporidial diarrhea, those receiving LGG showed a significant improvement in intestinal permeability [39]. The mechanisms by which probiotics exert immunomodulatory effects are not completely understood. However, LGG was demonstrated to modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses, particularly those against gastrointestinal pathogens, resulting in increased levels of serum IgG and secretory IgA targeting enteric pathogens including rotavirus [39].",

Furthermore, when PBMCs from the volunteers treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 were cultured with inactivated human influenza virus A/H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), the expression of IFN-\u03b1 showed a higher tendency and that of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was significantly elevated as compared with the control group. These results suggest that the intake of L. lactis JCM5805 can prevent the pathogenesis of an influenza-like illness via the enhancement of an IFN-\u03b1-mediated response to the influenza virus [56]. In two separate studies, the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and the mRNA level of ISG15 in PBMCs were significantly higher in groups treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 as compared to the corresponding control groups [57, 58]. In addition, Sakata et al. reported that the intake of yogurt containing L. lactis JCM 5805 significantly reduced the cumulative incidence rate of influenza among schoolchildren in a rural area of Japan [59]. Finally Fujii et al. showed the effects of oral L. lactis JCM 5805 on systemic and mucosal immunological parameters of healthy volounteers in winter (common cold season in Japan). After 4 continuous weeks administration, L. lactis JCM 5805 significantly reduced cumulative days of symptom of sore throat, compared with control. In L. lactis JCM 5805 group, change in secretory IgA levels in saliva and phagocytic activity of neutrophil were significantly lower than those of initial level, but not in the placebo group, although they could not reach statistical differences between groups at endpoint [60].

Especially, they use TLR9 for the recognition of microbial nucleic acids via detecting unmethylated CpG motifs of DNA and TLR7 for the recognition of microbial RNA or synthetic guanosine analogs. The activation of pDCs by TLR ligand binding leads to the production of type 1 IFNs [64]. The type 1 IFN family includes IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which serve as components of the first-line defense against infection by blocking viral replication [65]. The induction of type 1 IFNs is mostly associated with viral infections and it is well known that pathogenic bacteria stimulate IFN-\u03b1 production [66]. However, nonpathogenic bacteria including probiotics used in food preparation have been less intensively studied regarding their ability to stimulate DC-mediated IFNs induction [67]. As described separately in detail, we previously screened various lactic acid bacteria for their ability to stimulate IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs and found that L. lactis JCM 5805 was the most potent stimulator of type 1 IFN production [67].",

As a result of this direct activation of DCs by L. lactis JCM 5805, the major type 1 and type 3 IFNs (i.e., IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03bb) were found to be induced efficiently. However, IFN-\u03b1 production was completely abolished in dendritic cells obtained from TLR9 or MyD88 knockout mice. Thus, these data strongly suggested that L. lactis JCM 5805 stimulated IFN-\u03b1 production via TLR9/MyD88 signaling. Furthermore, we examined whether IFN-\u03b1 production was induced by CpG DNA, which is a known TLR9 agonist, or DNA extracted from L. lactis JCM 5805. Both CpG DNA and the DNA extracted from L. lactis JCM 5805 strongly induced IFN production. In addition, L. lactis JCM 5805 was observed to be specifically taken up by pDC, suggesting that its phagocytosis played an important role in activating pDCs and consequently inducing the production of IFNs [67].",
