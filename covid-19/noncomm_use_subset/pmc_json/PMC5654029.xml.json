Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires, which were distributed and collected before resident education activities.

            "text": "We examined the attitudes and emotions related to an MERS outbreak of the medical residents serving as frontline physicians in 4 tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, KSA. Overall, our results indicated that most of medical residents believed their job put them at considerable risk of exposure and were afraid of contracting MERS; however, they also believed that it was part of their professional duty to care for MERS patients and accepted this risk of infection. Participants were also not willing to change their jobs due to the risk of exposure to MERS and they were confident that the hospitals would look after them if they were infected. These results generally accord with 2 recently published studies conducted in KSA among health care workers (HCWs), which sought to examine their attitudes and concerns regarding the emerging outbreak of MERS-CoV. In particular, in both studies, HCWs reported that their job put them at a high risk of contracting the infection.9,10 For example, Abolfotouh et al9 reported that around 70% of surveyed participants felt at risk of contracting a MERS-CoV infection at work, although around 61% felt obligated to provide medical care for patients infected with MERS-CoV. These findings are also consistent with studies conducted in other countries dealing with different viral outbreaks that had major emotional impacts on healthcare workers.5-7 For instance, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, approximately two-thirds of healthcare workers in Toronto experienced concern for their own or their family\u2019s health.6 In Hong Kong, 68% of participants reported a high level of stress and 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress; high stress was much more common among nurses and younger workers.6 Unsurprisingly, most medical residents at the 4 centers recognized their professional obligation to look after patients with MERS despite the potential risk to themselves. This contrasts with the findings of a previous study in Australia during the avian influenza outbreak of 2006, wherein a hospital staff absentee rate of 38% was found.11 Similar findings to the Australian study were reported in Hong Kong and Mainland China during the SARS outbreak, wherein a large number of HCWs were absent or refused to look after the infected patients.6 By contrast, in Germany, only 28% of surveyed healthcare workers agreed that it would be professionally acceptable for healthcare workers to abandon their workplace during an influenza pandemic to protect themselves and their families, whereas 52% disagreed with this statement.12 We found that older residents were more likely to report being afraid of infection than were younger residents. This is in contrast to Nickell et al5 study, wherein 73% of staff who were younger than 30 years of age reported being concerned about infection, compared with only 65.6% of staff who were older than 50 years Tam et al6 reported a similar finding to Nickell et al5 younger staff members were more prone to job stress during a SARS outbreak than were older staff. However, in both Tam et al6 and Nickle et al5 studies, medical doctors were a minority of participants, making up only 9% and 3% of their cohort. In contrast, Wong et al8 report no significant differences in distress among the age groups8 In line with our study, Abolfotouh et al9 reported that a greater percentage of HCWs who were older than 35 years of age reported a high level of concern about infection than did HCWs who were younger than 35 years (27% versus 23%)12 Our finding may be attributed to the fact that we included only physicians. In addition, the cultural background of our sample might have influenced our findings: older physicians tend to have families and to be supporting their loved ones. Moreover, the median age of our sample differed from that of previous studies showing that younger staff had more concerns about infection than did older staff.",

Moreover, the available level of expertise is often greater than that of primary or secondary hospitals. Another reason might be that we used medical residents as a sample, whereas most of participants in the other studies were nurses. The limitations of the present study include the cross-sectional research design and the possibility of reporting bias. Moreover, because the study was conducted in 4 tertiary hospitals in a single city, the results might not be generalizable to residents in other parts of the country. Although the MERS outbreak started in Jeddah, it has continued since its discovery in 2012 and spread to most of the hospitals in the country, including those involved in this study. Therefore, it is likely that all medical residents in these 4 hospitals had been exposed to or cared for suspected cases of MERS-CoV. Nevertheless, our study provides initial evidence for the attitudes, perceptions, and emotions related to an MERS outbreak among medical residents.",
