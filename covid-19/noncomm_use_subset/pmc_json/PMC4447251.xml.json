            "text": "The recent emergence of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; pandemic in 2002 to 2004), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; Arabian Peninsula epidemic from 2012 to the present), and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV; United States porcine epidemic from 2013 to the present) coronavirus (CoV) infections is indicative of a reoccurring global public health vulnerability (1\u20133). At the end of the SARS-CoV pandemic, of the 8,096 cases confirmed by the WHO, 774 patients died from SARS, a mortality rate of slightly less than 10% (4). Ten years later, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed in more than 1,000 patients, approximately 40% of whom have died, highlighting the need for continued surveillance for emergent human coronaviruses with the potential to cause severe disease (5). The relative ease with which these pathogens have been spread outside the original geographic origins by global travelers is particularly troubling. Furthermore, recent surveys of bat populations, a known reservoir host of zoonotic coronaviruses, have observed that bats harbor myriad novel and potentially emergent coronaviruses with unknown pathogenic potential, indicating that coronavirus spillover into human and livestock populations may continue (6). Despite the importance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as public health threats, there are currently no available antivirals against these pathogens, with current evidence suggesting that the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon (IFN) are not efficacious in ameliorating SARS or MERS infections (7\u20139). While research on MERS-CoV is still in the nascent stages, efforts to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV have been hindered by the challenges of vaccine-induced immune pathology as well as the likely need for cross-protection against highly variable and antigenically distinct coronaviruses with unknown emergence and pathogenic potential (10\u201312).",

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that differentiate between viral and host molecules likely traffic within similar locations in coronavirus-infected host cells and may be detected by similar classes of cellular sensors. Innate immune sensors recognize PAMPs specific to viruses and other invading pathogens, triggering transcriptional changes in host cell signaling programs to establish an antiviral state that suppresses viral replication efficiency. Respiratory virus infections are potentially devastating global health concerns, as evidenced by emerging highly pathogenic 1918 and 2009 H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza A viruses (IAV), as well as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics (13). The human lung has critical functions in gas exchange and represents a large and complex but highly vulnerable mucosal surface that interfaces with multiple microorganisms in the environment. Lung cells, including type II pneumocytes and ciliated cells of the airway epithelium, are the primary targets of SARS-CoV and IAV infection in the lung (13, 14). When these cells are exposed to pathogens, innate immune signaling cascades are initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include multiple classes of cellular sensors distributed at cellular membranes and within the cytosol to ensure maximal detection of viruses at multiple stages of the replication cycle, including viral entry and genome replication (15).",

TLR3 has been implicated in the detection of many RNA viruses and in altering the pathogenesis of airway disease resulting from respiratory virus infections such as IAV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus infections (16\u201318). Basal levels of TLR3 expression are detectable in lung tissues such as in human alveolar cells and bronchial epithelial cells, as well as in various immune cell populations (19). In cells, TLR3 is anchored to the membrane of endosomes, where it recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) motifs from invading pathogens (20). After binding the dsRNA motif, TLR3 dimerizes and recruits the TRIF adaptor protein (21, 22). TRIF recruitment to the endosome results in signaling to activate transcription factors, including IRF3 and NF-\u03baB (23). In addition to TLR3-specific signaling, TRIF has also been described as an adaptor for signaling by DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 complexes as well as an adaptor for TLR4 signaling (22, 24).",

TLR4 signals through either MyD88 or TRIF using two sorting adaptors: MAL (for MyD88-dependent signaling) and TRAM (for TRIF-dependent signaling) (27). The TLR4/TRAM/TRIF signaling cascade has been previously implicated in the exacerbation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza virus infections and acid damage models (28). Controversially, TLR4 has been identified as potentially mediating immunopathogenesis of influenza virus, and TLR4 antagonist Eritoran has been proposed as an immunomodulatory therapeutic for influenza virus infections (29, 30). The role of TLR4 in highly pathogenic coronavirus infections is unclear, although C3H/HeJ mice that are naturally deficient in TLR4 are more susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection than C3H/HeN mice with wild-type TLR4 signaling capability (31). TLR signaling via TRIF leads to the activation of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and CCL5), and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (RSAD2, IFIT1, and CXCL10) (19, 22). These effector molecules have defined importance in the context of ARDS and respiratory virus infections (13, 32).",

Both the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) and the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are protective against SARS-CoV infection in mice when administered prophylactically, although poly(I:C) is more effective than LPS (33). In addition, treatment with poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist which signals independently of MyD88, has protective effects in mouse models of infections by highly pathogenic coronavirus species, including group 2c (MERS-like) coronaviruses (36). There is a need to understand how TLR signaling and effector networks may regulate coronavirus pathogenesis, given the diverse pool of zoonotic precursors with potential for spillover into human and livestock populations. Previous data from our laboratory had indicated a protective role for the TLR adaptor protein MyD88, which facilitates downstream signaling through a large number of TLRs, in our mouse model of SARS-CoV disease (37). Here, we present evidence that MyD88-independent signaling operating through TLR3 and TLR4 via the TRIF adaptor protein exerts a powerful protective cell-intrinsic defense network in response to SARS-CoV infection and disease.",

From these microarray data derived from the host mRNAs in the lung, network analyses identified host pathways regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis that were previously uncharacterized (wound repair pathways [38]) as well as pathways that have a well-established foothold in the literature in respect to SARS-CoV pathogenesis (innate immune pathways) (39). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in the recognition of pathogens and induction of the innate immune response to many viruses, but TLR recognition of SARS-CoV is not well characterized. Two TLR-related genes that were highly ranked on the prioritized list are differentially expressed in response to SARS-CoV infection compared to expression in mock-inoculated mice: MyD88 and TLR3 (Fig. 1A and B).",

SARS-CoV-infected mice had a RNA expression profile for TLR3 similar to that for MyD88: it was differentially expressed at day 2 postinfection with SARS-CoV at the doses of 103, 104, and 105 PFU of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1B). Based on the similarities in gene expression of MyD88 and TLR3, the ranking of the genes by network integration analyses, and the known protective role of MyD88 in SARS-CoV infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 signaling may also be involved in the protective innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. TLR3 signaling occurs in a MyD88-independent manner via the TRIF adaptor protein, so these data indicate that at least two discrete TLR signaling pathways are involved in the host response to SARS-CoV infection.",

Lower values of the ratio of PENH to midtidal expiratory flow (EF50) (TPEF/Te [RPEF]) in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice persisted throughout SARS-CoV infection, while wild-type mice RPEF values recovered to basal levels by day 4 postinfection (Fig. 3E; ***, P < 0.001).

These measures indicate that major changes in lung function occurred in the TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV, potentially due to changes in large-airway debris and denudation, as indicated by the results of histological analysis (see Fig. S2A to I in the supplemental material).",

To determine the role of TLR4 in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, we infected TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type C57BL6/J mice intranasally with 105 PFU of rMA15\u2013SARS-CoV. TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice lost a greater percentage of their starting weight, with statistically significant differences in weight loss compared to wild-type mice on days 3 to 7 postinfection, but began recovering by 7 days postinfection (Fig. 5A; *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001). TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly higher titers of virus in the lungs than wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV at days 2 (3-fold difference; ***, P < 0.001) and 4 (4-fold difference; *, P < 0.05) postinfection but had cleared the virus by day 7 postinfection, similarly to wild-type mice (Fig. 5C). Because TLR4 can signal in either a MyD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent manner via the usage of the sorting adaptor MAL or TRAM, respectively, we infected 10-week-old female TRAM\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type C57BL6/J mice intranasally with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV in order to discriminate between the effects of MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent signaling. TRAM\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV lost significantly more weight than wild-type mice (Fig. 5B; ***, P < 0.001). TRAM\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV demonstrated prolonged weight loss through 10 days postinfection, while wild-type mice recovered from weight loss by day 6 postinfection (Fig. 5B). TRAM\u2212/\u2212 mice had titers that were 3-fold higher than those seen with wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 2 postinfection (**, P < 0.01) but not on day 4 postinfection and cleared the virus by day 7 postinfection similarly to wild-type mice, despite lack of recovery from weight loss (Fig. 5D). The alterations in lung function measured by whole-body plethysmography that were observed in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 and TRAM\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV were similar to those observed in wild-type mice (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), supporting our hypothesis that TLR4/TRAM/TRIF signaling has a modest protective effect against SARS-CoV infection.",

At day 4 postinfection, significantly more expression of IL-6, TNF, CCL5, and IFN-\u03b3 was observed in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice, while expression was diminished in wild-type animals infected with SARS-CoV (Fig. 6A to D; *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001).

Expression of ISGs downstream of IFN, including RSAD2, CXCL10, and IFIT1, was greatly reduced in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 2 postinfection compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 6F to H; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001) but was induced to very high levels in the TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 4 postinfection while the ISG response was waning in wild-type mice (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).",

In SARS-CoV-infected TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice, there is significantly increased mortality, weight loss, and viral titers (Fig. 3A and B), leading to expression of cytokines, chemokines, and ISGs (Fig. 6; see also Fig. S4 in the supplemental material) consistent with the aberrant cellular signaling programs seen in patients who succumbed to SARS or MERS disease (44, 45). Although MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV had mortality, weight loss, and viral loads comparable to those of TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV, the outcomes in downstream cellular signaling programs were very different (37). In MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV, there was an absence of induction of cytokine and chemokine signaling at days 2, 4, and 6 postinfection compared to wild-type mice; in contrast, TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV had a similar lack of cytokine and chemokine signaling on day 2 but an increased amount of IFN-\u03b2 followed by a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokine and ISG signaling on day 4 postinfection (Fig. 6). One explanation of these data may be that an initial lack of innate immune response in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV leads to higher viral titers, which in turn leads to compensatory innate immune signaling resulting in the induction of cytokine, chemokine, and ISG expression at day 4 postinfection. Consistent with these data, TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected intranasally with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) have increased mortality rate, significantly greater viral titers in the brain, and increased production of type I IFN (46). In contrast, TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with IAV were not significantly different from wild-type mice in mortality, but one study found that MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice, while another found there was no difference between the responses of MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type mice infected with IAV (16, 47). These data indicate that, although both TLR adaptors (MyD88 and TRIF) are vitally important to a protective immune response to SARS-CoV, differences exist between the cellular signaling programs induced by highly pathogenic respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses and influenza viruses that should be considered prior to the administration of therapeutic regimes (48).",

In addition, despite similarities in infiltrating cell populations in MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 4 postinfection, a lack of cytokine and chemokine signaling persisted, indicating a likely deficiency in the activation of signaling programs of these cells. In TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice, however, many differences in infiltrating cell populations were observed at day 4 and day 6 postinfection, but the increase in transcription of proinflammatory cytokines indicates that a lack of TRIF does not inhibit cell signaling programs by these cell populations. Rather, the large induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression on day 2 postinfection and the presence of significantly more viral antigen at early times postinfection likely drive the increased stimulation of infiltrating cell types in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice, contributing to aberrant cellular responses.",

Similarly indicative of lethal pathogenesis of respiratory viruses, infection of mice with highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus, including 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 IAV, resulted in significantly more recruitment of neutrophils (at levels similar to the levels seen in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV) than was observed following infection with seasonal IAV strains of low pathogenicity (50). There is evidence that neutrophils infiltrating the pulmonary compartment produce robust amounts of CXCL10, contributing to the pathogenesis of ARDS from IAV infection, and the induction of large levels of CXCL10 was observed in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 4 postinfection, coinciding with the influx of neutrophils (32). In influenza virus infection, infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes resulting from IFN induction contributes to resistance of influenza virus infection, while significantly more Ly6Chi monocytes were observed in the more susceptible TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 postinfection in our model (51). This inflammatory monocyte population can differentiate into macrophage and pDC subsets, which were observed in significantly higher numbers in TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 6 postinfection (Table 1; reviewed in reference 52).",

Although TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV experienced greater weight loss, higher viral titers, and more significant alterations in lung function over the course of infection (Fig. 1C and D; see also S1A to C in the supplemental material), relatively few changes in TRIF-dependent downstream cellular signaling programs resulted from the absence of TLR3 (Fig. 2B to I), indicating that additional pathways may compensate for the absence of TLR3 in SARS-CoV infection. Other innate immune sensors, such as MDA5, that detect dsRNA and that have been implicated in the sensing of coronaviruses may be important for compensatory effects in the absence of TLR3 (53). Among the few changes that were observed in TRIF-dependent signaling pathways in TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 postinfection, IFN-\u03b3 expression was significantly higher in wild-type mice than in TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice; however, absence of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor has minimal impact on SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a similar mouse model (54). The relevance of changes in CCL5 is difficult to infer, as CCL5 and other related chemokines signal through multiple receptors, including CCR1 and CCR5, the absence of which modestly increases SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model (37). In contrast to our results with SARS-CoV, TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice are less susceptible to H3N2 and H5N1 IAV, with a decreased mortality rate compared to lethal infection of wild-type mice, but there is no difference in the survival of TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice infected with a lethal dose of p2009 H1N1 IAV (16, 55). The phenotype of TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice in West Nile virus (WNV) mouse models is somewhat controversial, with one group showing a modest increase in WNV-induced mortality with no differences in type I IFN levels in TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice, while another group showed that TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice have less susceptibility to WNV and reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses compared to wild-type mice (56, 57).",

The involvement of TRAM signaling indicates that the TRIF adaptor protein mediates a large part of TLR4 signaling in response to SARS-CoV. The studies presented here indicated that TLR3 and TLR4 individually mediate a portion of the TRIF-dependent TLR signaling necessary for survival of SARS-CoV in our mouse model. These are among the first observations of the role of individual TLRs in contributing to protection from SARS-CoV disease. Interestingly, the absence of either TLR3 or TLR4 does not lead to lethal SARS-CoV disease similar to that seen with TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV, likely because an absence of signaling via a single TLR may be compensated for by sensing of viral PAMPs by other PRRs.",

Imai et al. observed that oxidized phospholipids, putative PAMPs potentially contributing to acute lung injury by activating TLR4 and signaling through TRIF, were present in ARDS patient samples as a consequence of the presence of infectious diseases such as H5N1 IAV and SARS-CoV infections (28). The finding that TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to acute lung injury via IAV and acid models is in contrast to our findings here that TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice have significantly more disease resulting from SARS-CoV infection than wild-type mice (Fig. 5). One explanation for these conflicting data is that activation of TLR4 by oxidized phospholipid PAMPs may be detrimental in acid injury and IAV infection mouse models but that, in the case of SARS-CoV infection, the benefits of TLR4 sensing of PAMPs may outweigh the damaging effects of cellular signaling programs resulting from sensing of oxidized phospholipids by TLR4. Additionally, TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are less susceptible to influenza virus infection and an immunomodulatory approach using a TLR4 antagonist was proposed to have ameliorative properties for the treatment of influenza virus infections (29). These findings indicate that protective signaling via TLR4/TRAM/TRIF may be a unique feature in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses compared to that of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses and that different cellular sensors recognize pathogens with similar clinical features and infecting similar cell types.",

Neither MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice nor TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with SARS-CoV efficiently cleared the virus by day 6 postinfection, but both showed increased signs of disease, ultimately leading to death of the TLR adaptor knockout mice from SARS-CoV infection. Our observations support previous findings indicating that signaling through TRIF is critical for CD8+ T cell expansion, a key component of adaptive immunity for viral clearance (58, 59). In contrast to the TLR adaptor knockout mice, RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice with no mature T cells fail to clear SARS-CoV but show no signs of increased disease, as defined by weight loss, indicating that the lack of clearance of virus alone is not responsible for the disease phenotypes seen in the TRIF\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice (37). In generating a protective immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, our findings indicate that not only the activation of an adaptive response but also the proper activation of a balanced innate immune response through both adaptor arms of TLR-mediated signaling is required for viral clearance.",

TLR3 and TLR4 agonists have protective effects against SARS-CoV infection. In addition, adjuvant approaches that stimulate TLR pathways through MyD88 and TRIF may prove synergistic, especially when both components are critical to the host response, such as in SARS-CoV infection. Our data support the idea that innate immune responses are important for the antiviral state of cells, immune cell recruitment, and expansion of adaptive immune responses. Comparison of these data to those from other models of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection (particularly influenza virus infection) indicates that although these viruses may be detected by similar pathways, the result of that sensing can lead to differences in disease outcome which should be considered in the design and administration of vaccine and antiviral therapeutics.",

Data were analyzed by Finepoint software (Buxco) for established metrics of airway hyperresponsiveness and virus infection-associated airway obstruction, including enhanced pause (PENH), tidal midexpiratory flow (EF50), and ratio of TPEF to Te (RPEF). PENH is an empirical measure calculated by Te\u2212TrTr*PEFPIF, where PEF is the peak expiratory flow, PIF is the peak inspiratory flow, Te represents the time of expiration, and Tr represents the relaxation time to 36% of the peak expiration pressure (62). PENH has been controversially linked to airway hyperresponsiveness, obstruction, and bronchoconstriction but has been used in several viral models of airway infection, where increases in the PENH value correlate with increased lung pathology following respiratory viral infection (40, 42, 62\u201364). EF50 indicates the flow rate at 50% of the tidal volume. RPEF is calculated by TPEFTe, where TPEF is the time to peak expiratory flow and Te is the time of expiration, and the ratio may be interpreted as an indication of the shape of the exhalation curve.",
