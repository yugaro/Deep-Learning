            "text": "A feature common to infections by all positive-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes creating miniorganelles or \u201creplication factories\u201d where RNA amplification and eventually also virion assembly take place (reviewed in reference 1). These structures facilitate coordination of the different steps of the replication cycle, i.e., RNA translation, replication, and assembly, but might also shield viral RNA from degradation and recognition by the host\u2019s immune surveillance. Two classes of morphologically distinct replication factories have been proposed, the invaginated vesicle/spherule type and the double-membrane vesicle (DMV) type (reviewed in reference 2). We and others have recently shown that DMVs represent the main component of membrane rearrangements induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) (3, 4). They are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accumulate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Owing to their sponge-like appearance, HCV-remodeled membranes have been designated the \u201cmembranous web\u201d (4\u20136). Importantly, purified DMVs contain active HCV replicase, arguing that these structures represent viral replication sites (7).",

            "text": "The HCV genome is an uncapped single-stranded RNA of ~9.6 kb that contains a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (reviewed in reference 8). After release of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, it serves as mRNA and is used for cap-independent translation via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located within the 5\u2032 UTR (reviewed in reference 8). The resulting polyprotein is co- and posttranslationally processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different proteins that are required for RNA replication and virion formation (reviewed in reference 9). The N-terminal region of the polyprotein comprises the structural proteins core and envelope protein 1 (E1) and E2 that build up the virus particle. The viroporin p7 and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) are accessory factors required for the assembly of infectious HCV particles (reviewed in reference 10). The minimal HCV replicase comprises the remaining nonstructural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (11). NS3 is composed of two domains comprising an N-terminal serine protease that is activated by interaction with NS4A and responsible for proteolytic maturation of the replicase proteins and an NTPase/RNA helicase domain formed by the C-terminal two-thirds of NS3 (reviewed in reference 12). Highly hydrophobic NS4B is believed to build the scaffold of the viral replication complex and forms oligomeric complexes that are important for the formation of DMVs (13\u201316). NS5A is an RNA-binding phosphoprotein containing an N-terminal amphipathic \u03b1-helix (AH) that stably tethers the protein to intracellular membranes (17, 18) (reviewed in reference 19). NS5A is composed of three domains (D1 to D3) that are separated by low-complexity sequence I (LCSI) and LCSII. D1 is the main determinant of RNA replication, whereas D3 plays a major role in the assembly of infectious virus particles, probably by interacting with the core protein (20\u201323). In fact, major parts of D3 can be deleted without affecting RNA replication and D3 tolerates in-frame insertion of heterologous proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) (24). The exact role of D2 remains to be determined, since a large segment within this domain can be deleted with no significant effect on RNA replication and virus production in cell culture (20); however, a recent study has demonstrated that D2 is required to suppress the activation of the interferon response (25). NS5B is a tail-anchored RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8).",

Expression and cleavage of the polyprotein in transfected Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells that stably express the T7 RNA polymerase were determined by Western blotting with different NS5A-monospecific antibodies to account for the removal of epitopes residing in different NS5A domains. As shown in Fig. 1C, the polyproteins were properly processed, with the exception of \u2206D1, where we observed two proteins that, on the basis of their apparent molecular weights and immunoreactivities with the monospecific antisera, were identified as NS5A and an uncleaved NS4B-5A precursor. Nevertheless, we note that fully processed NS4B was also generated by this mutant and the abundance of NS5A and NS4B was comparable to that in the other mutants.",

Two parameters were used for EM analysis. First, the abundance of DMVs per cell profile, which was determined by counting the DMVs residing in the cytoplasmic area (measured in square micrometers and calculated as the cell surface of a given cell section minus the nuclear region, which is devoid of DMVs). To account for the possibility that DMVs reside in different planes, sections taken at different cell levels were included in our quantification. Second, the DMV diameter was measured as the distance between the two farthest opposed points on the membrane of a given DMV to account for the fact that DMVs most often are elliptical. We note that an elliptical rather than a circular appearance of DMVs might be caused by compression artifacts generated during sample fixation or sectioning. However, this possible artifact did not affect our analysis because we always used the wild type as a reference for comparison.",

To corroborate this observation, we generated two additional deletion mutants: \u2206D2D3, lacking both domains and LCSII, and mutant \u2206LCSI-D3, lacking in addition LCSI (Fig. 1A). Both mutants still induced the formation of DMVs (Fig. 2F and G; Table 1), arguing that NS5A D1 is the critical determinant of membranous web formation. Consistent with this assumption, when correlative-light EM (CLEM)-based analysis of cells with proven expression of an NS3-5B polyprotein lacking NS5A D1 was used, no DMVs were detected (Fig. 3). Note that the field of view selected contains many mitochondria and especially lipid droplets (LDs) that were often found randomly clustered in certain regions of a cell. In cells containing large amounts of DMVs, mitochondria were frequently found at the periphery of DMV-containing areas, whereas LDs were found either within these areas or surrounding them (not shown). Taken together, these results showed that the intrinsically disordered regions of NS5A (LCSI up to D3) are dispensable for DMV induction yet required for RNA replication (D2) or virus assembly (D3) (20), respectively. Thus, the defect of mutant \u2206D2long in RNA replication is not linked to a lack of DMV formation.",

In the AH, which is required for HCV RNA replication (17), two mutations reported earlier (28) in the context of HCV isolate Con1 (genotype 1) were inserted into the JFH-1 isolate (genotype 2a). In these mutants, originally designated GBV-C 8-13 and GBV-B 8-13, the amphipathic character of the helix was maintained but highly conserved N-terminal amino acid residues 8 to 13 of NS5A were replaced with the homologous sequences of closely related GB virus C (GBV-C) and GBV-B, respectively (Fig. 4A). In agreement with previous results (28), the replication of mutant GBV-C 8-13 was clearly lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 4B), which we found to correlate with reduced efficiency of DMV formation in the expression system (Fig. 4G; Table 1). Mutant GBV-B 8-13 was replication incompetent (Fig. 4B) and unable to induce DMVs upon expression of the corresponding NS3-5B polyprotein in Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells, whereas single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) were still detectable (Fig. 4D; Table 1). Importantly, steady-state levels of these variant NS5A proteins were comparable to those of the wild type (Fig. 4C). Thus, specific residues within the NS5A N-terminal AH are required for the biogenesis of DMVs.",

This assay is based on cell lines stably expressing NS3-4A and transient coexpression of an NS4B-5B polyprotein substrate from a separate RNA (Fig. 6A). As a negative control, we used a cell line stably expressing an inactive full-length NS3-4A protease mutant in which the active-site serine residue had been replaced with an alanine residue (S139A) (32). Western blot analysis revealed proper polyprotein cleavage by wild-type NS3-4A, whereas only uncleaved precursor and presumably degradation products were found in cells containing the proteolytically inactive NS3-4A protein (Fig. 6B). While only large SMVs were found in the latter case (Fig. 6D), vesicles composed of two or more lipid bilayers were detected in cells containing the active NS3-4A protein (Fig. 6C). However, the number of DMVs induced in this trans cleavage setting was very low compared to that induced by a cis-cleaving NS3-5B polyprotein (0.0063/\u00b5m2 versus 1.07/\u00b5m2; Fig. 6F). Moreover, vesicles induced upon trans cleavage of the polyprotein had an electron-dense interior, indicative of a protein-rich content, which was not found in DMVs induced by the NS3-5B polyprotein. These results suggested that polyprotein cleavage in cis is required for efficient formation of DMVs and that DMVs detected in the trans cleavage system might represent different structures.",

In HCV, polyprotein processing by NS3-4A is a tightly regulated process that occurs in a preferential order with rather protracted cleavage at the NS4B-5A site (33\u201337). Interestingly, mutations altering cleavage kinetics at this site are detrimental for HCV RNA replication, but the underlying mechanism has not been studied (38). Assuming that cleavage kinetics might play an important role in the biogenesis of the membranous HCV replication factory, we determined the impact of altered NS4B-5A cleavage kinetics on the formation of DMVs. On the basis of a recent report (38), we generated mutant P43VV, exhibiting accelerated cleavage kinetics due to two valine substitutions for proline and isoleucine residues at the P4 and P3 positions of the cleavage site (Fig. 7A, Fast mutant). Indeed, when it was expressed in the context of an NS3-5B polyprotein, much less uncleaved NS4B-5A was found with this mutant, consistent with accelerated cleavage at this site (Fig. 7A). Moreover, consistent with the earlier report (38), we found that the P43VV double mutation, inserted into a subgenomic replicon, reduced RNA replication up to 100-fold at early time points posttransfection (Fig. 7B). When it was tested in the context of the NS3-5B polyprotein expression construct, the formation of DMVs (Fig. 7C) with a regular morphology was observed (Fig. 7D). However, DMV abundance was significantly lower than that in the wild type (Fig. 7E), arguing that regulated cleavage at the NS4B-5A site is important for efficiency of HCV-induced membrane rearrangements and thus RNA replication.",

Expression of the corresponding polyprotein in Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells revealed NS4B abundance to a level comparable to that of the wild type, whereas the abundance of NS5A was slightly reduced but it was still well detectable (Fig. 8B). Importantly, the IRES insertion mutant did not support DMV formation but instead induced SMVs (Fig. 8C). These results suggest that regulated cleavage at the NS4B-5A junction plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of HCV replication factories and that an NS4B-5A precursor appears to be required for DMV formation.",

            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses, including HCV, replicate their genomes in association with intracellular membranes (1). However, it remains largely unknown how viral proteins can promote the formation of these remarkable membrane alterations. In the present study, we explored the role of viral NS proteins in the formation of HCV-induced DMVs. We reported earlier that induction of the membranous web requires the concerted action of all of the HCV replicase proteins (4). Although the sole expression of NS5A was sufficient to induce vesicles containing two or predominantly more lipid bilayers, DMVs were just sporadically observed. Only when we expressed the polyprotein comprising NS3 to NS5B was DMV formation abundant, arguing for a complex and coordinated interplay between the viral replicase factors to induce these membrane rearrangements. This assumption is supported by the observation that mutations residing, e.g., in NS4B can also drastically reduce DMV formation or alter their morphology even though NS5A is present (16). Thus, while NS5A can induce DMVs on its own, additional determinants are required for the proper formation of the membranous HCV replication factory. To gain further insights into these determinants, in the present study, we mapped the elements within NS5A that are required for DMV biogenesis. We found that the N-terminal AH and D1 are the primary determinants of this process. This is consistent with the observation that D1 is essential for RNA replication. Moreover, this domain binds RNA (29, 39), but it remains to be determined whether this property plays a role in DMV formation. The observation that the \u0394D2short mutant does not produce hyperphosphorylated NS5A in spite of replication and DMV formation efficiency comparable to those of the wild type suggests that hyperphosphorylation of NS5A is not strictly required for DMV formation. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that, in the case of this NS5A variant, the basal and hyperphosphorylated forms have very similar electrophoretic mobility and thus are not separated by conventional gel electrophoresis, our conclusion is in keeping with the notion that hyperphosphorylation is critical for assembly, whereas basal phosphorylation appears to favor RNA replication (40\u201342).",

Consistent with this assumption, in this study, we observed a correlation between the amount of DMVs detected in cells containing replicating HCV RNA and replication fitness as determined with subgenomic replicons (Table 1). However, this correlation appeared less strict when ectopic expression of the polyprotein was used to induce DMVs. For instance, the \u0394D2short and C142A mutants both replicated like the wild type and induced comparable numbers of DMVs in replicon-containing cells, whereas significantly fewer DMVs were observed in the expression system. Although the DMV number in the expression-based system was, in general, ~10-fold higher than in replicon-containing cells, variability was also much higher and therefore quantitative information is difficult to gain from this system. Nevertheless, owing to high efficiency of DMV formation, the expression system is ideally suited to obtain qualitative information, especially about mutants that do not support HCV RNA replication.",

First, in spite of efficient polyprotein trans cleavage by the minimal NS3 protease domain, full-length NS3 was required for DMV formation. Thus, the helicase domain plays an important role in membrane remodeling by the HCV proteins. Whether this is due to structural constraints mediated, e.g., by helicase interaction with other viral or cellular proteins or viral RNA or whether helicase activity per se is needed for membrane remodeling remains to be determined. Second, we found that expression of the viral protease in trans, together with the NS4B-5B polyprotein substrate, induced only very low numbers of DMVs, in spite of highly efficient trans cleavage. Thus, high efficiency of DMV formation requires a contingent NS3-5B polyprotein acting in cis.",

HCV polyprotein cleavage occurs in a preferential order, with NS4B-5A representing a rather stable precursor (33\u201337). Interestingly, a mutation previously reported to accelerate cleavage at this site (38) diminished the formation of DMVs, correlating with a reduction of HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, elimination of the NS4B-5A precursor by the insertion of a heterologous IRES between NS4B and NS5A completely blocked DMV biogenesis, arguing that this precursor plays an important role in the formation of the membranous HCV replication factory. The reason why NS4B-5A intermediates are required for DMV formation and RNA replication might be related to a slow process of NS4B or NS5A maturation to allow proper folding, dimerization/oligomerization, or a posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. In addition, proper folding might play an important role in the interaction of NS5A with host cell factors, e.g., those involved in cellular membrane homeostasis (19, 26). In this case, the NS4B-5A precursor would exert a spatio-temporal regulation of these interactions. Additionally, features of the NS4B-NS5A precursor itself might play a distinct role in initial steps of HCV membrane-remodeling events. For instance, the linkage of AHs in the NS4B C-terminal domain and at the very N terminus of NS5A in the precursor might exert a membrane activity different from that of the fully processed proteins.",

Single expression of each of these nsps leads to a distinct membrane rearrangement such as membrane proliferation or induction of vesicles, but DMV formation appears to require the concerted action of all three nsps (45). Along these lines, it is also known that the expression of replicase subunits nsp2 to nsp7 of arteriviruses induces membrane changes similar to those in infected cells (46), with nsp2 and nsp3 playing the main role in inducing a membrane-bound scaffold for the arterivirus replication complex (46).

The 3\u2032 UTR of HCV and the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (Luc; gray box) are shown as stem-loop structures. An enlarged view of the organization of the NS5A domain is shown below. The numbers at the top refer to amino acid residues of the JFH-1 polyprotein, and numbers in parentheses refer to residues of NS5A. Deletion mutants are shown below; the names of the mutants are shown to the left of the illustrations. The numbers in parentheses refer to the amino acid (aa) residues of the polyprotein that were removed. (B) Replication kinetics of NS5A deletion mutants. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with subgenomic Luc reporter replicons. Cells were harvested 4, 24, 48, and 72 h post electroporation (hpe), and the luciferase activity in the lysates was determined. Values were normalized to the 4-h value, reflecting transfection efficiency. A replication-deficient mutant encoding an inactive NS5B polymerase served as a negative control (\u0394GDD). RLU, relative light units; WT, wild type; LOD, limit of detection. (C) Polyprotein processing of NS5A mutants. The basic construct used for expression of the NS3-5B polyprotein and NS5A mutant proteins derived therefrom is shown on the top. It contains the promoter (Pm) of the T7 RNA polymerase (gray box) and the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus upstream of the polyprotein coding region. Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were transfected with expression constructs specified above the lanes, and 24-h later, cells were lysed and HCV proteins were detected by Western blotting with various NS5A-, NS4B-, and NS3-specific antibodies as specified on the right of each panel. \u03b2-Actin served as a loading control.
