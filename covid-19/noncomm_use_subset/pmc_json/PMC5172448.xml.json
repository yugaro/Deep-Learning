What\u2019s more, we expected that this opportunity could promote the subject construction of genomics in China and realize the strategic development object of promoting the subject and industry with projects and achievements. With this great ambition and courage, academic leaders represented by Prof. Huanming Yang et al. established the Human Genome Center of CAS to apply for joining HGP for China, and managed to undertake 1% of the sequencing task. Various difficulties, including hard financing, rough working environment, and laborious tasks day after night, did not scare but stimulated everyone to devote to the project with higher enthusiasm. With the joint efforts of scientists from United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, and China, on June 26, 2000, the six countries announced the completion of the draft sequence of the human genome. On April 4, 2003, leaders of the six countries jointly announced the successful completion of HGP. The participation in HGP not only earned honor and glory for China, but also promoted the subject construction of genomics in China to catch up with the world, established large-scale technique platforms for genome sequencing and bioinformatics, and tempered an outstanding team with both professional skill and high solidarity.",

The hybrid rice bred by Prof. Longping Yuan, academician of CAS, has a wide influence in China and Southeast Asia; indica rice and its hybrid varieties account for 80% of farmed rice in the world. Therefore, we launched the Chinese Super Hybrid Rice Genome Project in May 2000 on the basis of the staple food plant of China\u2014the indica rice and its hybrid varieties. The working draft sequence of the indica rice genome was announced in October 2001 and published in Science in April 2002. In December 2002, the completion of the fine map of the indica rice genome was announced. Its significance on agriculture can be compared with that of HGP on human health. By analyzing the complete genome sequence of rice, we can get a great deal of genetic information and function genes relating to the good properties of rice, promote the upgrade of rice, and cultivate new breeds of higher yield and quality. It is also helpful to understand the relative genes in the genome of other important crops like wheat and corn, thus promote the basic research and application of the whole food plant.",

The horizontal development includes the genome research of important species like rat, mouse, chimpanzee, pig, chicken, soybean, corn, and so on. The vertical research consists of the genome polymorphism among races in the world, medicine genome for individuals, high-throughput gene expression and proteomics, the structure and function of proteins, and so forth. These large-scale exploration and analysis of fundamental bioinformation are stimulating and enhancing the development of laboratory apparatus manufacture and reagent industry. The output of huge capacity data is also promoting the development of high-performance computing and data processing system. The combining growth of biotechnology and information technology makes them the fastest growing and most challenging fields in the world information industry. Such rapid informationization of life sciences will surely bring about the comprehensive and fast development of all relative industries.",

Under this goal, we brought forward three scientific programs for the development of science and the Chinese nation. The first one is Yanhuang Program for the protection and exploitation of human genetic resources for disease prevention and human health. Based on genomics technology, this program researches the relationship between gene polymorphism and diseases, pathogeny, and metabolism, and carries out the collection and application of genetic resources of the Chinese population. Its scientific subjects are heredity, metabolism and health. The second one is Shennong Program for the protection and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine and biological resources. It is aimed at the modernization of traditional medicine and pharmacology, and works on the exploitation and application of pharmic biological resources starting from genome research. The scientific subjects of this program are traditional Chinese medical science, traditional Chinese medicine and health. The third one is Xuanyuan Program for the protection and exploitation of biological and ecological resources. This program aims at the modernization of agriculture and starts from the genomics research on biological and ecological resources, with food nutrition, entironment and health as its scientific subjects.",

Therefore, finding and researching the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has become one of the contents and targets of HGP. We carried out the Chinese Genetic Polymorphism Project, named as \u201cYanhuang No.1\u201d, and cooperated with many domestic medical research institutions to study diseases by using SNP. In the end of 2002, we participated in the International HapMap Project, a major international project to produce a complete map of common patterns of differences in the human genome\u2014haplotypes. This project aims at establishing a public database for helping researchers find genes related to human diseases and drug response. HapMap will be the key information for researchers to identify these genes, and all the data of this project will be open to the public freely.",

Nowadays it has become a common opinion of world silk scientists that it is very necessary to find and construct a \u201cSilk Road in the 21st Century\u201d to break through the traditional silk technology, fundamentally control the lepidopterous pests, and improve the development of biological medicine. This plan should start from the silkworm, center in modern science and technology, and depend on the platform of genome research. Fierce competitions have taken place in this research field. On June 1, 2003, BGI and The Southwest Agricultural University of China cooperated together and launched the Silkworm Genome Project. In November 2003, we took the lead in the world to accomplish the draft genome sequence of silkworm. This is another significant breakthrough in the field of genomics by Chinese scientists after the accomplishment of HGP (China part) and the Rice Genome Project, demonstrating that China has been on the leading level in the world on the silkworm genome research.",

The project, expected to take several years, is the first one to tackle livestock. Phase one of this project is aimed to identify valuable genes, develop markers for physical and genetic mapping, and provide research tools for xenotransplantation in three years. The second phase would develop a working draft covering 90% of the sequence and 95% of the genes. The pig genome is estimated to contain 3\u00d7109 bp, roughly the same size as human.

Final analyses of both projects are underway and the results are expected to be published this summer. The data for the chicken variation map have been made available to collaborating scientists and will soon be deposited in public databases.

On April 15, 2003, 36 hours after obtaining samples, BGI successfully sequenced the whole genomes of four different SARS-CoV isolates. In 48 hours, proteomics analysis of the SARS-CoV was successfully conducted. Within 96 hours, the ELISA diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV were produced and were used for clinical diagnosis soon after. Then we carried out the systematic study of SARS including SARS-CoV genome sequence analysis, protein analysis, development of detecting kits, and screening of anti-SARS drugs. The fight against SARS displayed the capabilities of all the comprehensive science and technology platforms in our institute to quickly respond to emergencies.",
