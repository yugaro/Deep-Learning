There have been no reports on the cultivation of a Korean PDCoV strain, although several research groups from the USA and China have reported the successful propagation of PDCoV strains in cell culture [123].

KNU16-07 virus produced distinct cytopathic effects (CPE) typical of a PDCoV infection, such as cell rounding, clumping together in clusters, and detachment in infected ST cells at passage 2. In later passages, visible CPE appeared at 12 h post-infection (hpi) and became pronounced by 24 hpi. Virus propagation was confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay using commercial (SD55-197; Medgene Labs, USA) and homemade (KDN4-1) PDCoV N-specific MAbs as described previously [6]. In contrast, no CPE or N-specific staining were evident in mock-inoculated cells (panel A in Fig. 1). Ultrastructural analysis of purified virus suspensions revealed multiple virus particles approximately 150 to 200 nm in diameter with typical spike-like surface projections that were morphologically indistinguishable from those of coronaviruses (panel B in Fig. 1). The viral genome levels in selected passages were examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR as described previously [611]. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value was determined to be 15.0, ranging from 13.9 (P10) to 16.1 (P5). The infectious titer of the isolate ranged from 107.8 to 108.8 TCID50/mL up to P5; this value was stably maintained in later passages. The peak viral titer reached 107.8 TCID50/mL or more beginning at P5 (panel C in Fig. 1). Analysis of growth kinetics demonstrated that KNU16-07 replicated rapidly and efficiently in ST cells, reaching a titer > 106 TCID50/mL by 12 hpi (panel D in Fig. 1).",

All inoculated animals were positive for PDCoV, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, at 1 or 2 dpi, and they shed PDCoV in feces. Peak mean Ct values of 16.8 (range, 16.7\u201316.8) and 18.7 (range, 18.5\u201318.9) were obtained at 3 to 4 dpi. The negative control pig remained active with normal feces and no fecal shedding of PDCoV detected throughout the study period. Two animals were independently euthanatized at 3 and 5 dpi for postmortem assessments, whereas the remaining piglets were necropsied at 35 dpi. Unlike the negative control piglet, all challenged piglets exhibited typical PDCoV-like macroscopic observations with thin and transparent small intestine walls (panel A in Fig. 2). The inoculated pigs also developed histopathological intestinal lesions associated with viral enteritis, including shortened and fused villi in the small intestine (panels B and C in Fig. 2). Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry assay detected PDCoV in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes throughout the small intestines (panel D in Fig. 2). These macroscopic and microscopic observations are consistent with previous studies using USA PDCoV isolates [15]. Taken together, the results show that experimental infection of newborn piglets with PDCoV KNU16-07 induces clinical disease signs corresponding to acute enteritis, indicating enteropathogenicity of the isolate in the natural host. Additionally, all inoculated pigs had detectable PDCoV-specific neutralizing antibody (NA) by 14 dpi and maintained high NA titers of 1:128 to 1:256 thereafter, demonstrating the ability of KNU16-07 to induce efficient immune responses.",

The full-length genomic sequences of the original fecal sample (KNU16-07-feces, GenBank accession No. KY364365) and cell-passaged viruses were comparatively analyzed; the data are summarized in Table 1. Compared to KNU16-07-feces, KNU16-07-P5 and -P10 identically showed five nucleotide differences at positions 7737, 8218, 16481, 19808, and 21875. All mutations were non-synonymous, causing two, one, and two amino acid changes in the ORF1a, ORF1ab, and S coding regions, respectively. The two amino acid substitutions at positions 162 (Thr to Asn) and 851 (Asn to Ser) in the S coding region were sustained through passage 30 (KNU16-07-P30). No cell culture-adapting mutations arose in the E, M, and N protein-coding regions. These results reveal that the PDCoV isolate KNU16-07 is genetically stable during cell passages.",
