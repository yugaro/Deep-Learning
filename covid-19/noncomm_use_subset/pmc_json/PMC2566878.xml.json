It was later changed to \u2018one gene\u2013one polyprotein\u2019 to account for the discovery of polyproteins. However, today there are several cases which violate this assumption. By alternative splicing several protein variants are made by selecting different sets of exons from one single gene. With trans-splicing, proteins are synthesized from exons of different genes (2). Another way of enhancing the information content of an mRNA are translational recoding events. With codon hopping (bypassing) (3), the ribosome skips over a gap in the open reading frame (ORF) and resumes translation at a downstream codon. In procaryotes, UGA codons followed by a characteristic stem\u2013loop structure are redefined from stop codons to insertion of selenocystein (4).",

A stop codon in the original reading frame is then bypassed in the shifted reading frame. This way, two different protein products can be obtained from one mRNA. The frequency of frameshifting events at a particular site is used by viruses for a defined ratio between the two proteins. Changes in the ratio can lead to less efficient virus propagation and thus, can be a target for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, a role of \u22121 PRF in posttranscriptional regulation has been proposed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5). The authors propose a model where \u22121 PRF leads to premature termination targeting the mRNA for rapid degradation via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.",

The slippery site is the location of the actual frameshift event having the consensus sequence X XXY YYZ (triplets are shown for the preshifted reading frame). The structural element follows within a few bases and can be a simple stem\u2013loop structure or a pseudoknot. It is believed that the pseudoknot promotes a higher frameshift efficiency, since it is more effective in pausing the ribosome. It is also known that ribosome pausing is a necessary, but not sufficient prerequisite for frameshifting (6). The exact mechanism, by which the ribosome is brought into a different reading frame is still unknown. Two different models were recently proposed in (7) and (8).",

It is based on a two-step procedure, where the first step identifies slippery sequences followed by a possible frameshift pseudoknot. In the second step, candidates are analyzed statistically. In more detail, RNAmotif (12) is used in the first step and finds all potential pseudoknots that could be formed according to a descriptor. The descriptor specifies the allowed loop and helix lengths which are extracted from known \u22121 PRF pseudoknots. All potential pseudoknots are then subjects of statistical analysis in step two. The potential pseudoknots are refolded with pknots (13), a minimum free energy (MFE)-based RNA folding algorithm, capable of predicting a wide class of pseudoknots. The MFE of the folding is compared to folding energies of randomized sequences via z-score analysis. Finally, sequences with a low z-score (<\u22121.65) are regarded as statistically significant, since they appear to be more stable than expected by random.",

Sequences are forced to fold into a pseudoknot in the first step but are folded freely in the second step. Thus, the result of the procedure is indeed 2-fold: (i) the final candidates have the theoretical potential to fold a pseudoknot, and (ii) they have a MFE folding which is more stable than expected by random. However, it is not guaranteed that the stable structure which causes the good z-score actually is a pseudoknot. In fact, we found that from 1679 strong candidates only 163 contain a pseudoknot. The pseudoknot, which was folded by RNAmotif in step one, may have an energy similar to the MFE folding, but more likely, it will be less stable and hence, less probable to be formed in equilibrium.",

However, explicitly formulating the exact recurrences which evaluate the folding space according to the above restrictions is a difficult and error-prone task. A remedy to this is to use a more high-level approach: the RNA-pseudoknot folding program pknotsRG (18,19) describes its search space by means of a grammar. The underlying thermodynamic model (20) (also used by Mfold and RNAfold), upon which optimizations takes place, is encapsulated in an \u2018evaluation algebra\u2019. This concept of describing a DP by a grammar and an evaluation algebra has been formalized in the algebraic dynamic programming approach (ADP) (21\u201323).",

This, of course, confirms that a positive \u0394 is a strong indicator for frameshift sites. From our small RECODE test set it is hard to conclude a definite threshold for a good separation of strong and weak candidates. In Figure 3, we show that in fact true PRF signals tend to have a higher \u0394 than nonshifting slippery sites. However, the separation of the distributions is by no means sufficient for a clear classification. As a rule of thumb, we can state that candidates with \u0394 > 0.1 are most likely true signals. With \u0394 > 0.05, we capture approximately the same number of false positive (FPs) and TPs. Finding the appropriate balance between high sensitivity and selectivity for this problem should therefore be governed by the intended use of the program. We also note that there are annotated pseudoknots with a \u0394 < 0. These are also the candidates where KnotInFrame failed to rank the true \u22121 PRF signal on a high position. We examined those FN in more detail and give explanations for their mispredictions:\nThe dominance of is_m_is_is3 is undefined (\u2018b\u2019 in Table 2) since the slippery site is out of KnotInFrames scope due to the remarkable appearance of the slippery sequence: it has a length of only 4 nt.The \u22121 PRF signal of pol_m_vir_gill has a total length of 177 nt but the longest substring the pipeline folds is 120 nt. A more detailed look at the annotation, reveals that the classification as a pseudoknot is at least questionable: the \u22121 PRF pseudoknot signal has been predicted by a hairpin folding via Mfold. Afterwards, the hairpin has been manually extended to a pseudoknot, by looking downstream for a complementary site which is able to pair with the hairpin loop region. This is also the reason for the exceptional length of the structure. An examination of the second stem with RNAduplex from the Vienna RNA package revealed a free energy of only \u22125.7 kcal/mol. In accordance with the energy models implemented in state-of-the-art pseudoknot folding programs, this energy might be too low to compensate for the destabilizing effects of the pseudoknot loops.A similar consideration holds for the entry of pol_m_vir_hcv. Its annotated pseudoknot is much longer than the maximal length of our consensus model. In this case, our pipeline folds at most the first 120 nt of the whole structure and hence can only find an alternative, suboptimal pseudoknot. Thus, this site is ranked low in our evaluation.A possible reason for predicting the frameshift signal of edr_m_euk_mmus on rank 5 might be that the structural frameshift component is not the pseudoknot reported in the RECODE. In (25) a more complicated pseudoknot with a 3 nt bulge in the first stem is reported. Our consensus model does not account for such pseudoknots and hence an alternative, suboptimal structure is folded. Consequently this structure is then ranked low by KnotInFrame.\n\n",

For each candidate, we shuffled 100 randomized sequences with the same dinucleotide content and folded them with pknotsRG-fs. In (27), it has been shown that using a TDM for z-score analysis provides a stronger signal than using a general folding algorithm. However, the outcome for \u22121 PRF signals is less fruitful than the results of (27) as shown in Figure 4. Most of the FPs have a z-score between 0 and \u22123. The fact that the z-scores are not centered at 0 is most certainly a result of KnotInFrame discarding unfavorable folds during the filtering phase. This already introduces a bias for more stable structures than expected by random. With a z-score of \u22123 and lower, the number of TPs equals approximately the number of true negatives (TNs). A small number of TPs is also deeply buried in the cloud of FPs which makes it hard to detect them either by z-score analysis or via the normalized dominance. Altogether, it turns out that with z-score analysis, we have the same difficulties in separating the true PRF signals from the wrong ones. Therefore, we refrain from using the z-score in KnotInFrame, since it would increase the runtime by a factor of 100 (for folding the randomized sequence) without a significant increase in performance.\n",

These candidates were made available by the authors in their PRFdb [(28), http://dinmanlab.umd.edu/prfdb/]. First, we asked what portion of those 1679 candidates were also predicted by our pipeline. On the first glance, the result was astonishing: only 257 sites were confirmed by our analysis, i.e. they were predicted within one of the first five ranks for each ORF. By visual examining of some of the missed candidates the reason was immediately obvious. The predicted structure in the PRFdb often does not resemble the pseudoknot frameshift consensus. Instead, we find virtually all possible other structures, such as a single hairpin, a chain of hairpins, bifurcated structures or complex pseudoknot structures. This supports our main criticism of the approach of Jacobs et al.: the candidate sequences have the base-pairing potential to build a pseudoknot specified by the (RNAmotif) consensus, but for most sequences an alternative structure is more stable. This alternative structure is then used for the z-score computation and stored in the PRFdb. In contrast, our approach explicitly folds the consensus pseudoknot and the alternative structure and assigns to candidates with a more stable alternative structure a negative \u0394 and consequently a low rank. Therefore, we filtered the list of strong candidates in the PRFdb for structures containing at least one pseudoknot and obtained 163 candidates. Visual inspection revealed that this set still contains lots of structures neither conforming to our nor Jacobs et al.'s consensus. If we further filter out all structures violating the consensus (e.g. a too long spacer, too short helices, a too long loop 1, etc.; examples are provided in the Supplementary Data), we end up with only 74 structures \u2014 <5% of the original PRFdb. As expected, the overlap with our predictions is much larger for this set: 19 out of 74 were also predicted by KnotInFrame. In other words, the overlap for this set is around 26%, while for the complete PRFdb it is only 15%. We conclude that KnotInFrame supports the predictions of Jacobs et al. only partially, even if both methods were reduced to structurally similar putative PRF events.",

Again, only a small portion (13) of these predictions are supported by the PRFdb. The reasons for this are manifold: first, Jacobs et al. are using a more stringent consensus, which allows only 1\u20133 bases in loop 1. Second, the folding program used in the creation of the PRFdb (pknots) uses an outdated energy model, while KnotInFrame uses the most up to date energy model for nested structures and an adapted model for pseudoknots. In consequence, it happens that a stable structure reported by KnotInFrame is rejected in the PRFdb due to a possibly worse energy reported by pknots. Remarkably, the maintainers of PRFdb started to include another RNA folding algorithm [NUPACK (29)] into the pipeline, which uses an energy model close to ours. Database entries derived from NUPACK analysis seem to be more consistent with our results. However, we cannot quantify the improvement, since the inclusion of NUPACK seems to be work in progress and only parts of the database are currently reprocessed.",

Various reasons have been given above, e.g. the differences in the structure prediction methods. However, we think the most influencing difference in both methods is the scoring system. While KnotInFrame employs normalized dominance, Jacobs et al. use z-scores and free energy for ranking. The fact that these two criteria are not equivalent can already be concluded from Figure 4, but has also been proven by our yeast screen comparison. In our opinion, normalized dominance is better suited for the task of discriminating true PRF signals from random ones. The z-score measures the evolutionary fitness of a sequence under evaluation against other (random) sequences that could have evolved instead, but were rejected during evolution due to an inferior fitness. In contrast, the normalized dominance makes an exact statement of how likely a given sequence folds into a frameshift inducing structure and not into an alternative one. In this sense, normalized dominance evaluates the \u2018fitness\u2019 of the PRF structure against its present competitors\u2014those which exist in the folding space of the given RNA sequence, rather than against those that might exist in the past/future of a mutated sequence.",

The run time determining factor of the folding steps are the calls to pknotsRG-fs, hence we have to consider the time it needs to fold one sequence, which is on average 0.6 s for a substring of 120 nt. Note that we actually do not have to compute the foldings for the smaller subsequences (40, \u2026, 100) separately. They can simply be backtraced from the dynamic programming matrix of the largest subsequence. Also, the theoretical run time depends on the probability of a slippery sequence to occur in a random sequence, given by:\n\nHence, the expected run time for an average sized bacterial genome of 5 MB with 5 \u00b7 106 \u00d7 0.00195 = 9750 slippery sites (and thus 9750 calls of pknotsRG-fs) is \u223c0.6 s \u00d7 9750 = 1 h 37 min. In practice, the first filter (ISF) already discards a significant amount of slippery sites (42% for the RECODE test set), before the expensive folding step and run time decreases.
