            "text": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global disease. The majority of carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are inhabitants of Africa and Asia.1, 2 Immune tolerance is a hallmark of persistent HBV infection.3 Typically, patients with chronic hepatitis B are infected through their parents in the early stage of life.4 Remarkably, the immune system of the host may respond to the HBV5 but does not produce the immune clearance of HBV. HBV may replicate in host cells peacefully until they enter immune clearance phases 2\u20104 decades later.3 If the HBV can be eradicated, HBV replication will be terminated, and ultimately 50% of hosts may clear HBsAg by 80 years of age.6 Genome\u2010wide association studies from Asia have revealed that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2010DP and HLA\u2010DQ loci play roles in persistent HBV infection. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Our objective is to understand the evolution of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were responsible for HBV\u2010related immune tolerance during human migration and to correlate the HBV\u2010related SNPs with a prevalence of chronic HBV infection among global populations. Based on the data from 1,000 genomes collected worldwide, we conducted a global perspective study on the allele frequency of hepatitis\u2010related SNPs.",

All genotypes of five immune\u2010related SNPs differed significantly between Esan in Nigeria in Africa and Toscani in Italy in Europe and between LWK in Africa and GIH in South Asia (Table 1; P < 0.001). In addition, both CFB and CD40 shifted from a higher expression in African genotypes (rs12614:TT; rs1883832:CC) to a lower expression in European and South Asian genotypes (rs12614:CC; rs1883832: TT).14, 15 These changes conferred a decrease in the strength of immune responses. The CC genotype of rs12979860 (IFNL4), which is more prevalent in East Asia, is associated with a lower baseline IFNL3 (interleukin\u201028B) expression.16, 17 The IFNL4 open reading frame is truncated by a polymorphic frame\u2010shift insertion (rs368234815), which turns IFNL4 into a polymorphic pseudogene in East Asian populations.18 Because the prevalence of HBsAg is higher in Africa than in Europe or South Asia, these trends of decreased immune protein expression are not related to HBV\u2010specific immune tolerance. Although it is clear that Europeans and South Asians are two different races, they showed similar genetic adaptions when they migrated out of Africa. These changes suggest that the decreased expression of immune\u2010related genes might have been an important survival strategy when humans migrated into new territories and faced new pathogens. The contact between different races of humans may induce devastating diseases, for example, when the New World was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492.25 A similar situation was well documented when Japan sent troops to Taiwan in 1874 and 1895; only 0.1% to 0.3% of soldiers died in battle, while around 10% died of diseases in a short period of time after arrival.26\n",

Most of the survivors in East Asia exhibit delayed HBV\u2010related immune clearance genotypes. This could have been a survival strategy to pass through the Indo\u2010China Peninsula and southern China during human migration. Such HLA class II genotypes are aimed toward an immune tolerance strategy.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 These changes were successful because this group of people spread to northern China and Japan and have become the largest population in the world numerically. However, such a survival benefit may have been a trade\u2010off with cold tolerance as these populations were unable to cross the Bering Strait in large numbers.
