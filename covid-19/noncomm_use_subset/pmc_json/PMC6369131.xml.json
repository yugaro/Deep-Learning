A previous study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection found that 93.88% and 89.58% of patients were IgG positive at 1- and 2-year post-symptom onset, respectively [6]. However, 3 years later, only 53.57% of the population had SARS-CoV specific IgG. A study on antibodies against MERS-CoV, including neutralizing antibodies, showed antibody persistence in six of seven individuals (86%), 34 months after the 2012 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jordan [7]. All seven subjects had respiratory symptoms and few underlying diseases, and five had substantial pneumonia. Mild or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections could potentially be associated with development of lower levels of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies over time [8]. Patients from the above study might not have been treated with antivirals. Subjects in our study were also young and healthy, with mild pneumonic consolidations at admission. Moreover, all patients in our study were treated with interferon-\u03b1, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Antiviral treatment for MERS associated with mild pneumonia might decrease viral replication and reduce antibody responses in the early stages of the diseases, resulting in the identified low-level neutralizing activity within convalescent serum.",
