Although HIRA collected all the health insurance claims in the ROK, the increase was not noticed by the HIRA until several months later. The HIRA realized that there was a dramatic increase in UI surgery through several field inspections of the medical providers [4]. The reason behind it was that there was discrepancy between payment from private health insurance companies and the new coverage expansion of the National Health Insurance (NHI) program as the NHI program was much less than the payment made by private health insurance companies. Many people who had private insurance policies that covered UI received medical care that included UI surgery. This episode enabled the HIRA to realize the necessity of a monitoring system for healthcare utilization of people for systematic maintenance of the NHI system in the ROK.",

The DBMS of the HUMS is operated on an HPUX operating system, and the other servers use Window NT and Window 7. One features of the HUMS is that it has an independently operated SAS server. The HUMS has servers for data mining to detect abnormal signs of healthcare utilization and to produce utilization predictions. Data produced through this process are stored at the DBMS server. The HUMS has been redesigned since 2013. Raw data loading and data loading for data mining take two days and at least five days, respectively.",

These data are produced through data mining process. The five types of the data mining models are applied in order to detect whether there is any abnormal signs of health care utilization. In addition, the HUMS uses a filtering process in order to produce two indices which are the percentage increase oscillator (PIO) and the relative strength index (RSI) values showing items that are out of specific data ranges. Items showing abnormal signs of health care utilization can be produced by the type of health care services such as the medical care, the dental care, the oriental medicine, and the pharmacies. Figure 3 is an example for health care costs with more than KRW 100,000,000 (approximately US$100,000) and filters them with PIO (\u226520) and RSI (\u226570) in order to detect abnormal sign of healthcare utilization.",

Therefore, the HUMS is not a real-time system, even though it appears to be real-time. Another limitation is that the databases of the HUMS are composed of many tables to enable fast data loading, which is called structured data. If users want to see more detailed results or other information, they have to run a separate analysis from the main DW system. Lastly, as mentioned in the previous section, the HUMS is composed of various server systems, which inevitably makes the system more complex and difficult to maintain. These three factors are the main limitations of the HUMS.",

The monitoring of abnormal healthcare utilization is based on health insurance claim data. The system is well spread out over the past history of healthcare utilizations and provides future predictions based on past history and data mining approaches. However, users should input the contents of categories that they want to investigate through the system. Although the system was designed to monitor the abnormal utilization of healthcare, the actualization of the data set was based on the past history of healthcare, and there is a time lag of 2 to 3 months because hospitals and clinics tend to file health insurance claims a little late.",

            "text": "Based on this study, several suggestions can be made to improve the monitoring system. First, it is necessary for the HIRA to develop a healthcare utilization monitoring system for the national level. This system should have real-time functionality. The current system is based on the review of health insurance claims data, so there is some lag-time between the actual provision of healthcare and the results being available for monitoring by the HUMS. Therefore, a new system should be structured like the HIRA's drug utilization review (DUR) system, which provides possibilities of contraindication of drugs for drug-drug interaction, drug-age interaction, etc. Whenever medical doctors and pharmacists want to check whether there is any possibility of contraindication when they prescribe or dispense drugs to patients, they can obtain confirmation through the HIRA's DUR system by connecting the system. This can be used in a real-time manner. When medical doctors complete their treatment for patients, some important information, such as the patients' identification and disease codes should be able to be transferred to HIRA's new data system specializing in healthcare utilization monitoring. Through such a system, the HIRA would be able to monitor healthcare utilization at the national level. This kind of system could certainly help the government make timely decisions to stop contagion outbreaks, such as the recent spread of MERS, and prevent secondary infections.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the HUMS has a user-friendly interface to quickly analyze large-scale health utilization for monitoring and supporting decision-making processes. This is a good example of linking health information with information technology [9]. If we use human resources to manually identify the abnormal utilization of healthcare services at the national level, it could be impossible to deliver due to the manual process involving billions of claims containing various patients' information. To improve the managerial efficiency of analysis, we have to use information technologies in the health sector as well [1011]. This study has empirically shown how the HIRA uses information technology, namely, the HUMS, to monitor and identify healthcare utilization showing abnormal healthcare. This introduction of the HUMS will provide some opportunities to share benchmarking ideas regarding the use of information technologies with other international communities in the health informatics field.",
