            "text": "Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes, including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003), viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010), and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014). Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973), cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006). For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains (Frost et al., 2009; Mim and Unger, 2012; Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Frost et al., 2008; Mim et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2015). This rigid scaffold has been hypothesized to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012). Notably, this perspective comes primarily from studies performed in vitro. In living cells, BAR scaffolds are thought to assemble into more limited scaffolds that shape membranes in concert with other proteins, including the dynamin fission machine and the actin cytoskeleton (Itoh et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2009; Renard et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Importantly, many in vitro studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004), the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2007, 2010), the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009), the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015), and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins that also frequently contain long, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Miele et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007; Henne et al., 2010; Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015). How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains?",

Further, previous work found that disordered domains, which occupy large footprints on the membrane surface in comparison to well-folded proteins of equal molecular weight (Hofmann et al., 2012), enhanced the efficiency of membrane bending and fission (Busch et al., 2015; Snead et al., 2017). However, a fundamental, unanswered question has limited the potential of protein crowding to explain membrane remodeling in cells\u2014what brings bulky domains together to generate steric pressure? In particular, what keeps crowded proteins from simply diffusing away from one another, dissipating steric pressure and inhibiting membrane shaping? Proteins such as amphiphysin (Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004) and FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2007, 2010), which contain both scaffold-forming BAR domains and bulky disordered domains, present a possible solution to this problem. Specifically, the ability of BAR domains to form scaffolds has the potential to locally concentrate disordered domains such that steric pressure is amplified rather than dissipated.",

To compare the membrane remodeling abilities of Amph-FL to those of the N-BAR domain alone, we first examined the effects of each protein on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending within 10 min of mixing vesicles and protein, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1 A and Videos 1 and 2). These GUVs often collapsed or broke apart into smaller tubules and fragments later during imaging (Fig. S1 A and Videos 3, 4, and 5), suggesting that lipid tubule formation was not the endpoint of the membrane remodeling process.",

As expected from previous findings (Peter et al., 2004; Gallop et al., 2006), the N-BAR domain transformed vesicles that had an average initial diameter of 200 nm into long tubules with average outer diameter 44 \u00b1 6 nm SD (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1, B and C). In contrast, Amph-FL did not drive appreciable membrane tubule formation in TEM experiments. Rather, Amph-FL divided the vesicles of initially 200-nm diameter into a population of highly curved vesicles with a peak diameter centered near 22 nm (Fig. 1, D and E; and Fig. S1 D). This finding suggests that formation of membrane tubules is not a stable endpoint of membrane remodeling driven by Amph-FL, as observed in GUV experiments (Fig. S1 A). In contrast, N-BAR did not drive a substantial shift in the vesicle diameter distribution in TEM experiments (Fig. 1 E). Collectively, these results suggest that Amph-FL is capable of driving membrane fission, a more energetically demanding process than membrane tubule formation (Campelo and Malhotra, 2012).",

In the first of these experiments, we used supported bilayers with extra membrane reservoir (SUPER) templates, which are glass beads surrounded by a low-tension membrane. Exposure of SUPER templates to fission-driving proteins results in measurable membrane release from the beads (Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008; Liu et al., 2011; Neumann et al., 2013). SUPER template experiments revealed that while both N-BAR and Amph-FL drove membrane release in the concentration range of 50 to 1,000 nM, Amph-FL drove more than twice as much (2.6 to 4.7-fold greater) membrane release at each concentration (Fig. 1 F). Amph-FL also drove consistently greater levels of membrane release compared with the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, a protein previously shown to drive membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017; Fig. S1 E). Notably, the apparent plateau in membrane release (Fig. 1 F) may be due to the fact that some of the SUPER template membrane interacts closely with the bead surface, increasing the barrier to membrane release, as seen in previous reports (Liu et al., 2011; Neumann and Schmid, 2013; Snead et al., 2017). However, substantially higher concentrations of Amph-FL up to 10 \u00b5M drove further membrane release (Fig. S1 E).",

Specifically, we tethered fluorescent vesicles to a coverslip passivated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG-biotin (Fig. 2 A). Vesicles in these experiments contained a biotinylated lipid, which facilitated tethering to the substrate through binding to neutravidin. Vesicles also contained the fluorescent lipid Oregon Green 488\u20131,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DHPE), which we used to quantify the brightness of each vesicle after imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy (Aguet et al., 2013; Fig. 2 B).

The proportion of vesicles that fell within the high curvature group (diameters below \u223c45 nm) increased with increasing protein concentration, from less than 1% at 50 nM to \u223c38% at 150 nM (Fig. 2 F). Importantly, the biotinylated lipid alone did not drive fission in the absence of protein (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, fission by Amph-FL was highly cooperative, leading to a bimodal distribution of vesicle diameter (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, previous studies using the same assay found that membrane fission by the ENTH domain resulted in a gradual shift of the size distribution toward smaller diameters (Snead et al., 2017). We speculate that local self-assembly of Amph-FL into membrane-bound scaffolds may drive budding of small vesicles directly from larger vesicles, resulting in a bimodal distribution of vesicle diameter.",

Some long, nondiffraction-limited lipid tubules were visible on occasion in tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR (Fig. 2 B), but our estimations of vesicle diameter did not change substantially if such puncta were excluded (Fig. S1 F). Tubules became more prevalent at micromolar N-BAR concentrations (Fig. S1 G), consistent with the tubules formed in TEM experiments (Fig. 1 C). However, N-BAR did not drive substantial vesiculation at micromolar concentrations, consistent with our findings from TEM (Fig. 2, E and F). Our results are in agreement with previous studies that have reported membrane tubulation by N-BAR at protein to lipid ratios of \u223c1:100 (Peter et al., 2004; Ambroso et al., 2014; Isas et al., 2015), the range in which we observed potent membrane fission by Amph-FL (Fig. 2 F). However, previous work has reported membrane vesiculation by the isolated N-BAR domain of amphiphysin at substantially higher protein-to-lipid ratios (Peter et al., 2004), in contrast with our findings at similarly high ratios (Fig. 2 F). Additionally, the isolated N-BAR domain of endophilin at a protein to lipid ratio of \u223c1:100 has been reported to drive membrane vesiculation (Poudel et al., 2016). The differences between these reports and our findings may be due to differences in lipid composition, differences between the amphiphysin and endophilin N-BAR domains, or differences in other experimental parameters. Notably, higher concentrations of Amph-FL were required to observe fission in TEM experiments compared with tethered vesicle experiments. This increase is due to the high lipid concentration used in TEM experiments (\u223c100-fold greater than tethered vesicle experiments), which is necessary to obtain an adequate density of lipid structures for TEM (Fig. 2 F; see Materials and methods). Taken together, our results from EM and tethered vesicle experiments confirm that Amph-FL is a potent driver of membrane fission, while the isolated N-BAR domain primarily forms membrane tubules.",

            "text": "How can we explain the ability of Amph-FL to drive membrane fission? One possible explanation could be that the full-length protein may bind more strongly to membrane surfaces compared with the N-BAR domain alone, resulting in more potent membrane remodeling. To examine this possibility, we used a tethered vesicle assay similar to the experiments described above to quantify the relative extent of protein\u2013membrane binding. In this assay, proteins were labeled with Atto 594 dye, while vesicles contained the lipid Oregon Green 488\u2013DHPE. We quantified vesicle diameter as described above, and used measurements of single fluorophore brightness to quantify the number of bound proteins per vesicle (Snead et al., 2017; see Materials and methods). From these measurements we determined the density of membrane-bound proteins, which increased with increasing protein concentration in solution (Fig. S2, A\u2013C). These experiments revealed that over the range of protein concentrations in which membrane remodeling and vesiculation began to occur, Amph-FL and N-BAR reached similar number densities of membrane-bound protein, indicating that the two proteins bind membranes with similar affinity (Fig. 2 G). Specifically, these results suggest that the disordered domain did not significantly enhance protein\u2013lipid and protein\u2013protein interactions, either of which would be expected to increase the density of membrane-bound protein. Indeed, the isolated disordered domain of amphiphysin showed no detectable binding to the membranes used in fission studies with Amph-FL (Fig. S2 D). Therefore, the ability of Amph-FL to drive membrane fission cannot be explained by differences in membrane recruitment. However, Amph-FL reached a high coverage of the membrane surface at substantially lower protein concentration compared with N-BAR, owing to the larger membrane footprint of Amph-FL (Fig. 2 H; see Materials and methods). These findings help explain how Amph-FL reached a crowded coverage of the membrane surface, sufficient to drive membrane vesiculation.",

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the ability of amphiphysin to drive membrane fission is that its substantial disordered domain (residues 240\u2013622) generates steric pressure that promotes fission, in line with previous studies on other membrane-bound disordered domains (Busch et al., 2015; Snead et al., 2017). If so, the isolated disordered domain should be able to drive membrane fission when bound to membrane surfaces at sufficient density. To test this idea, we purified the disordered domain of amphiphysin, lacking the C-terminal SH3 domain (Amph CTD \u0394SH3; Fig. 3 A). We first performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements to quantify the hydrodynamic radius of this domain. Specifically, we calibrated the diffusion time of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 against the diffusion times of two protein standards with known hydrodynamic radii, transferrin (Hall et al., 2002) and the C-terminal domain of AP180 (AP180 CTD; Busch et al., 2015). These experiments yielded an approximate hydrodynamic radius for Amph CTD \u0394SH3 of 4 nm (Fig. S2, E\u2013G; see Materials and methods), which corresponds to a radius of gyration of \u223c5 nm (Sherman and Haran, 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012), comparable to other disordered domains of similar molecular weight (Kalthoff et al., 2002; Busch et al., 2015). FCS experiments also showed that the size of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 varied with the concentration of monovalent salt in the buffer (Fig. S2 H), consistent with the known sensitivity of highly charged disordered proteins to changes in ionic strength (Srinivasan et al., 2014). We next performed tethered vesicle experiments to assess membrane fission by Amph CTD \u0394SH3. The protein included an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6his) tag to facilitate binding to membranes by the lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-([N-[5-amino-1-carboxypentyl]iminodiacetic acid]succinyl), nickel salt (DOGS-NTA-Ni; Fig. 3 A). Experiments revealed that Amph CTD \u0394SH3 drove the formation of highly curved fission products (Fig. 3, B and C). However, 100-fold greater concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 in solution (10 \u00b5M) was required to generate fission products of similar curvature to those observed with Amph-FL (100 nM; Fig. 2, D and F). Importantly, the DOGS-NTA-Ni lipids alone did not generate high curvature vesicles before protein exposure (Fig. 3 B, top histogram). Moreover, isolated 6his tags were not found to drive membrane remodeling (Fig. S2 I).",

At this coverage, steric pressure from protein crowding is expected to be sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier to membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017). Therefore, the requirement for a high solution concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 reflects the conditions necessary to promote crowded binding to the membrane surface. In contrast, Amph-FL showed substantially stronger binding compared with Amph CTD \u0394SH3 (Fig. 3 D), likely owing to polymerization of the BAR scaffold, which enables multivalent membrane binding (Sorre et al., 2012; Simunovic et al., 2016). However, plotting membrane vesiculation by Amph CTD \u0394SH3 and Amph-FL together as a function of the coverage of the membrane surface by proteins revealed that data for the two proteins fall along a similar trend (Fig. 3 E). This finding suggests that the requirement for a high concentration of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 to drive membrane vesiculation arises primarily from weaker membrane binding in comparison to Amph-FL, rather than from the absence of the N-BAR domain.",

This reasoning implies that any bulky disordered domain that is brought to the membrane surface by a BAR scaffold should be capable of driving membrane fission. To test this prediction, we created a chimera consisting of the amphiphysin N-BAR domain fused to the C-terminal disordered domain of rat epsin1 (N-BAR-epsin CTD; Fig. 3 F). Importantly, the disordered domain of epsin1 is comparable to the disordered domain of amphiphysin in terms of length (432 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) as well as hydrodynamic radius (Busch et al., 2015). Tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that N-BAR-epsin CTD generated highly curved fission products from vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm within a similar range of protein concentrations to Amph-FL (Fig. 3 G; compare to Fig. 2 D). Further, both N-BAR-epsin CTD and Amph-FL produced a very similar fraction of fission products with diameters below 45 nm at equivalent concentrations in solution (Fig. 3 H). Finally, SUPER template membrane shedding experiments revealed that in the concentration range of 50\u20131,000 nM, N-BAR-epsin CTD drove greater membrane release compared with the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 3 I), similar to the results of SUPER template experiments comparing N-BAR and Amph-FL (Fig. 1 F). Importantly, the isolated disordered domain of epsin showed no detectable binding to membranes used in fission studies (Fig. S2 D), suggesting that the disordered domain did not enhance membrane recruitment. These findings illustrate the ability of N-BAR scaffolds to promote membrane fission by crowding arbitrary disordered domains at membrane surfaces.",

            "text": "How does crowding among disordered domains overcome the ability of BAR scaffolds to stabilize lipid tubules? One explanation is that steric pressure among the bulky disordered domains of Amph-FL inhibits the assembly of a long-range N-BAR scaffold, which, if allowed to form, would inhibit fission. In support of this hypothesis, when Amph-FL reached \u223c70% surface coverage as shown above (Fig. 2 H), the underlying N-BAR domain covered only \u223c14% of the membrane, based on membrane footprints for Amph-FL and N-BAR of 79 and 16.5 nm2 per monomer, respectively (see Materials and methods). This coverage is significantly lower than expected for a fully assembled N-BAR scaffold, which approaches complete coverage (Mim et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2015). Furthermore, the volume available per amphiphysin disordered domain above the N-BAR scaffold is only \u223c50% of the volume that each domain would be expected to occupy in solution, based on its radius of gyration (Fig. 3 J; see calculation in Materials and methods). Notably, this calculation assumes that the disordered domains are incompressible, demonstrating that they would have to compress substantially in order to fit around the scaffold. Previous work has shown that substantial compression of disordered domains is energetically costly, likely exceeding the cost of membrane deformation (Busch et al., 2015). Collectively, these arguments suggest that the presence of amphiphysin\u2019s bulky disordered domains inhibits assembly of long-range N-BAR scaffolds.",

            "text": "Interestingly, previous structural studies using cryo-EM have reported limited observations of tubular N-BAR scaffolds formed from Amph-FL (Mim et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2015). These structures have been observed on membrane substrates containing a majority of negatively charged lipids, which are thought to provide a strong electrostatic driving force for scaffold assembly (Mim et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2015). Therefore, we performed tethered vesicle fission experiments using a similar membrane composition (Fig. S3). Here, the onset of membrane fission occurred at somewhat higher Amph-FL concentration, 350 nM (Fig. S3) in comparison to 75 nM (Fig. 2, B\u2013F). These results demonstrate that high concentrations of negatively charged lipids cannot prevent membrane fission as protein concentration increases. Indeed, the cryo-EM studies cited above suggest that long-range scaffolds assembled from full-length protein were more rare (Mim et al., 2012). Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions (Mim et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2015), conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014). This environment likely enabled the disordered domains to pack more efficiently around the scaffold, in line with the needle-like densities seen protruding from the N-BAR scaffold (Adam et al., 2015).",

            "text": "We next sought to evaluate the influence of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains in live mammalian cells. Multiple previous studies have established that overexpression of BAR domains leads to formation of lipid tubules in the cytosol that are coated by BAR scaffolds (Peter et al., 2004; Frost et al., 2008; Boucrot et al., 2012; McDonald et al., 2015). We first replicated these findings by overexpressing the N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4 A) in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that N-BAR generated a dense network of tubules inside the cells (Fig. 4 B), in agreement with previous findings (Peter et al., 2004). The number of tubules per cell increased with the expression level of N-BAR (Fig. 4 C), and colocalized with a plasma membrane stain (Fig. S4 A), indicating that many of the tubules originated from the plasma membrane as previously observed (McDonald et al., 2015, 2016). In contrast, overexpression of Amph-FL tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4 A) led to significantly fewer tubules per cell compared with N-BAR (Fig. 4, B\u2013D), suggesting that the disordered domain of Amph-FL inhibited tubule formation. Notably, Amph-FL interacts with the clathrin adaptor network and may therefore recruit other membrane remodeling proteins. As such, it is unclear whether the lack of stable tubules in Amph-FL\u2013expressing cells arose from the disordered domain or from other binding partners recruited by Amph-FL. To distinguish between these possibilities, we created a chimera of N-BAR fused to an alternative disordered domain, from the neuronal protein neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD), tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4 A). The disordered C-terminal domain of neurofilament-M acts as an entropic brush, radiating outward along the length of neurofilaments and sterically repelling neighboring disordered domains to control axon diameter (Brown and Hoh, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002). The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins. Overexpressing N-BAR-NfM CTD in RPE cells resulted in a similar phenotype to Amph-FL, in which the number of tubules per cell was significantly reduced compared with the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 4, B\u2013D). We reach similar conclusions whether protein expression level is matched in terms of the fluorescent protein intensity at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C) or in the cytosol (Fig. S4 B). However, the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-epsin CTD appeared to reduce plasma membrane binding slightly (Fig. S4 C). Furthermore, while tubules in N-BAR\u2013expressing cells had an average length of 6.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m SEM, tubule lengths in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were significantly shorter, 3.5 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m SEM, respectively (Fig. 4 E).",

Specifically, the tubules in cells expressing N-BAR had an average lifetime of \u223c75 \u00b1 5 s SEM, whereas tubule lifetime was significantly shorter in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD, \u223c29 \u00b1 3 and 35 \u00b1 4 s SEM, respectively (Fig. 4 F). The tubules formed by N-BAR also had greater fluorescence intensity in the protein channel relative to the local background in comparison to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD (Fig. S4, D and E). This finding indicates that the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote tubule fission by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Collectively, results from experiments in live cells indicate that bulky disordered domains are capable of disrupting the formation of stable tubules scaffolded by BAR domains, similar to observations in vitro (Fig. 1, C and D). The disordered domains may have inhibited tubule formation in these experiments by driving membrane fission, though future work is needed to test whether steric pressure from disordered domain crowding plays a substantial role in physiological fission events.",

            "text": "We next asked how the membrane remodeling ability of crowded disordered domains compares with that of BAR scaffolds. To make this comparison, we created a chimeric protein that places the two mechanisms in direct competition within the same molecule. Specifically, we fused the I-BAR domain of human IRSp53 to the bulky, C-terminal disordered domain of rat AP180 (569 disordered amino acids) to form I-BAR-AP180 CTD (Fig. 5 A). While the I-BAR domain is known to generate inverted membrane curvature (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009), the attached disordered domains should generate steric pressure that will tend to bend the membrane in the opposite direction. Exposing GUVs to the I-BAR domain alone drove inverted membrane tubulation, as expected (Fig. 5 B, left; and Video 7). In contrast, the I-BAR-AP180 CTD chimera drove neither inward nor outward tubulation. Instead, the protein caused the GUV membrane to fluctuate dynamically through nonspherical shapes in which regions of gentle membrane curvature extending both inward and outward were apparent (Fig. 5 B, right; and Video 8). These \u201cfrustrated\u201d fluctuations demonstrate that the disordered domain effectively neutralized the ability of the I-BAR domain to drive inward membrane bending. This result suggests that crowding among disordered domains and scaffolding by BAR domains make comparable contributions to membrane remodeling.",

            "text": "Membrane release experiments using SUPER templates showed that exposure to the I-BAR domain (100 nM\u20135 \u00b5M) decreased the amount of membrane shedding to levels lower than the amount of nonspecific shedding that occurred in protein-free buffer (Fig. 5 C, negative values). This result suggests that assembly of the I-BAR scaffold stabilized the membrane against shedding. In contrast, I-BAR-AP180 CTD drove positive membrane release at all concentrations (Fig. 5 C), demonstrating that the disordered domain of AP180 is capable of disrupting the membrane-stabilizing effect of I-BAR. Interestingly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that the highest concentration of I-BAR-AP180 CTD that we tested, 5 \u00b5M, drove membrane fission, generating a population of vesicles centered near 30 nm diameter (Fig. 5 D). This result demonstrates that, under appropriate conditions, steric pressure among crowded disordered domains is sufficient to overcome the structure-based curvature preference of the I-BAR scaffold. Importantly, while wild-type IRSp53 does not naturally contain a large disordered domain, the I-BAR domain\u2013containing proteins MIM and ABBA do contain regions of substantial disorder (\u223c475 amino acids in MIM; Lee et al., 2007). Therefore, our observations raise the question of whether the presumed role of these proteins in driving cellular membrane protrusions can be justified on the basis of in vitro studies of their isolated I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009).",

Interestingly, many proteins that contain the modestly curved F-BAR domain also have this architecture (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010), including the endocytic proteins FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010), its yeast homologue Syp1 (Reider et al., 2009), the srGAP proteins involved in neuronal development (Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015), the cytokinesis proteins Cdc15 (Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010) and Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Hof1 (Meitinger et al., 2011) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To test this idea, we examined FCHo1 (Caenorhabditis elegans), which consists of an N-terminal F-BAR domain followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of 412 amino acids and a C-terminal \u00b5-homology domain (Henne et al., 2010; Umasankar et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Fig. 5 E). Negative stain TEM revealed that exposure of vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm to the F-BAR domain of FCHo1 drove formation of lipid tubules with an average diameter of 21 \u00b1 2 nm SD (Fig. 5, F and G; and Fig. S5, A and B), in agreement with previous findings (Henne et al., 2007, 2010). In contrast, full-length FCHo1 (FCHo1-FL) did not generate lipid tubules, but instead divided the 200-nm-diameter vesicles into a population of highly curved vesicles with average diameter 17 \u00b1 7 nm SD (Fig. 5 H and Fig. S5, C and D). F-BAR also generated a population of high curvature vesicles in TEM experiments (Fig. S5 D); however, such vesicles accounted for only 20% of the overall distribution, while they accounted for 96% of the vesicle population after exposure to FCHo1-FL at a substantially lower protein-to-lipid ratio (1:30 versus 1:500 for F-BAR and FCHo1-FL, respectively; Fig. 5 K).",

However, the F-BAR domain alone did not drive fission in these experiments, even at substantially higher concentrations up to 2 \u00b5M (Fig. 5, J and K). Interestingly, in both tethered vesicle and TEM experiments, the fission products of FCHo1-FL had a peak diameter of slightly less than 20 nm, with some vesicles as small as 10 nm. These small diameters suggest that FCHo1-FL may stabilize the formation of membrane micelles, which are similar in morphology to the hemifusion intermediates that form during membrane fission (Campelo and Malhotra, 2012; Frolov et al., 2015). Notably, vesicles in these experiments were composed primarily of the lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), which has a lower bending rigidity than physiological membranes (Dimova, 2014). In contrast, when we increased bilayer rigidity by replacing DOPC with the substantially more rigid, fully saturated lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC; Lee et al., 2001; Dimova, 2014), the average diameter of fission products increased to \u223c50 nm at 50 nM of FCHo1-FL, consistent with bilayer vesicles (Fig. S5, E\u2013G). Collectively, these studies show that, despite their gentle curvature, F-BAR scaffolds are also capable of collaborating with disordered domain crowding to drive efficient membrane fission, producing highly curved vesicles. These findings suggest that the ability of BAR domains to assemble into scaffolds that concentrate disordered domains, regardless of their intrinsic structural curvature, makes an important contribution to membrane fission.",

Further, our findings are in contrast with the established view that BAR scaffolds prevent fission by stabilizing membrane tubes (Boucrot et al., 2012). Instead, our work suggests that BAR proteins that contain substantial disordered regions may be drivers of membrane fission. Importantly, previous reports have observed that Amph-FL generates lipid tubules shortly after protein exposure (Takei et al., 1999; Neumann and Schmid, 2013), in agreement with the findings of our experiments with GUVs at early time points (Fig. S1 A). However, we found that at later time points, Amph-FL drove membrane fission in each of our assays (Fig. S1 A and Figs. 1 D and 2 D).",

However, previous studies in live cells suggest that amphiphysin could be playing a supporting role in membrane fission, potentially via a protein crowding mechanism. For example, deletion of the yeast amphiphysins Rvs161/167 leads to a defect in the entry of clathrin-coated pits into cells (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011), suggesting that Rvs161/167 may support membrane fission. However, Rvs161/167 is a heterodimer, and only Rvs167 contains a large disordered domain (Ren et al., 2006). Additionally, depletion of amphiphysin by RNA interference inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (Meinecke et al., 2013), although this endocytic defect has been previously attributed to a reduction in dynamin recruitment.",

This hypothesis is in contrast to the idea that FCHo1/2 are primarily involved in the initiation of clathrin-coated pits (Henne et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016). However, previous work showed that FCHo2 is present throughout the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits (Taylor et al., 2011), supporting the possible role of FCHo2 in membrane shaping. Moreover, many F-BAR proteins involved in other cellular pathways such as cytokinesis also contain large regions of intrinsic disorder (Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010; Meitinger et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2016).

            "text": "More broadly, our work raises the possibility that protein assemblies beyond BAR domains may serve as scaffolds for crowding bulky disordered domains in order to ensure efficient membrane fission. One potential example is dynamin, a scaffold-forming GTPase involved in fission of clathrin-coated pits (Antonny et al., 2016). Dynamin plays an essential role in driving membrane fission in diverse cellular contexts (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018). While dynamin itself does not contain substantial regions of disorder, it assembles with proteins that contain such domains, including amphiphysin and SNX9 (Daumke et al., 2014). We speculate that once recruited by dynamin, these proteins may generate significant steric pressure at membrane necks. In line with this thinking, the yeast dynamin homologue, Vps1, is dispensable for fission, but is necessary for proper localization and accumulation of amphiphysin at clathrin-coated pits (Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2010; Kishimoto et al., 2011). A function of Vps1 could therefore be to organize and concentrate bulky disordered domains at membrane necks to promote fission. Moreover, previous studies found that amphiphysin acts synergistically with dynamin to enhance membrane fission (Meinecke et al., 2013; Neumann and Schmid, 2013). However, one report found that amphiphysin alone did not drive membrane fission in the absence of dynamin (Meinecke et al., 2013), in contrast with our findings. Notably, this study used rat amphiphysin 2\u20136 (Meinecke et al., 2013), a splice variant that contains a disordered domain that is only 30% of the length of the disordered domain in human amphiphysin used in our study (Wigge et al., 1997). The substantially shorter disordered domain likely generates lower steric pressure, which may explain its reduced capacity for membrane vesiculation.",

The hydrodynamic radius, RH, of each protein is also reported next to each trace. AP180 CTD was used as a calibration standard to compute RH of Amph CTD \u0394SH3, as \u03c4D is directly proportional to RH. AP180 CTD is a disordered protein with a radius that has been well-characterized (Kalthoff et al., 2002; Busch et al., 2015), making it an appropriate calibration standard. This calibration approach also yielded a radius for transferrin that was consistent with its expected radius (Hall et al., 2002), confirming the validity of our approach. The radius of Amph CTD \u0394SH3 was taken as 5 nm in estimates of membrane coverage by proteins in Figs. 2 H and 3 D.

Diffusion times were corrected for changes in solution viscosity with changing NaCl concentration (Zhang and Han, 1996).

DOPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were replaced with 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni in experiments with Amph CTD \u0394SH3. Dried lipid films were hydrated in 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.35, and 150 mM NaCl buffer (0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA were included in experiments with PtdIns(4,5)P2) and sonicated or extruded to 200 or 30 nm. Imaging wells were prepared as described above. Vesicles were diluted to 5 \u00b5M in the wells and allowed to tether for 10 min. Untethered vesicles were removed by thorough washing with MOPS buffer. After tethering, Atto 594\u2013labeled protein was added to the specified concentration, and multiple spinning disc confocal z-stacks of lipid and protein fluorescence were acquired, with a z-step of 0.1 \u00b5m. Images were collected after \u223c15 min incubation of protein with vesicles. The same laser power and camera gain settings were used for all experiments. Fig. S2 A shows images of tethered vesicles with 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL-Atto 594, demonstrating increased protein brightness (and therefore membrane coverage) with increasing protein concentration.",

Here we only accepted puncta that persisted at the same location through three consecutive imaging frames. The algorithm also searched for fluorescent puncta in the protein channel using the centroids of the detected fluorescent puncta in the master lipid channel. The search region in the protein channel was three times the SD of the Gaussian fit to the point spread function of our microscope. We estimated vesicle diameters from lipid fluorescence brightnesses by calibrating against dynamic light scattering, as described in the previous section. We estimated the number of bound proteins on each vesicle by comparing brightness values in the protein channel to the brightness of a single molecule of Atto 594\u2013labeled protein. Images of single molecules of Atto 594\u2013labeled proteins were obtained by adding a dilute concentration of protein to an imaging well on an ultraclean coverslip, and imaging single proteins adhered to the coverslip surface in a similar manner as described for the tethered vesicles. A linear correction for camera exposure time was applied to the single molecule brightness, as longer exposure times were required to image single molecules compared with membrane-bound protein. Fig. S2 B shows a plot of the raw protein intensity values as a function of vesicle intensity for 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL. The 25-nM data show a higher slope than 10 nM, indicating greater membrane coverage. Fig. S2 C shows this same data after processing, plotted as the number of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle diameter.",

The average membrane coverage was estimated as the mean of all individual vesicle coverage values. To confirm the validity of this analysis approach, we also plotted the area of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle surface area, as shown in Fig. S2 L for the 1 \u00b5M Amph CTD \u0394SH3 dataset. The slope of a linear fit to these data provides an alternative estimate of membrane coverage.

Therefore, data with N-BAR and Amph-FL in Fig. 2, G and H were collected using vesicles of higher initial curvature, which were found to not undergo substantial remodeling during experiments. Specifically, N-BAR and Amph-FL data were collected using sonicated and 30-nm\u2013extruded vesicles, respectively. Vesicle diameters were estimated by calibrating against a sample of the same vesicles before protein exposure, with the exception of sonicated vesicles.

TagBFP was amplified from the li-Str_ManII-SBP-tagBFP plasmid using PCR primers, which introduced AgeI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting tagBFP sequence was digested and ligated onto the CLC backbone to generate BFP-CLC with a linker sequence of HKGRPTR.
