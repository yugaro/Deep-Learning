As a result, many methods in information\nextraction are proposed by researchers. Among them, the graphical representation of\nDNA sequences is an effective method for the virtualization and similarity analysis.\nGraphical representation is a kind of alignment-free method. It provides intuitive\ninformation of data by visualization of biological sequences. What is more, it is\nmore generally applicable because its mathematical description of data facilitates\nnumerical analysis without difficult calculations. Therefore, numerous works based\non graphical representation have been presented by researchers.1\u20138 For example, Randi\u0107 et al1 proposed a graphical representation of RNA secondary structure based on\ntwelve symbols. Bieli\u0144ska-Wa\u017c et al5 proposed a 2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences in 2007. After that\nthey proposed more dynamic representations of DNA sequences for\ngeneralization.6,7",

In the works by He et al15 and Hu,16 the physicochemical properties are also indispensable in information\nextraction from proteins because they have effects on the rate and pattern of\nprotein evolution.
