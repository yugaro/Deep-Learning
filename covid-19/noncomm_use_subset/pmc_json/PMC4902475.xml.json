When the newly drifted variant is identified during the Northern Hemisphere winter, there is a chance to incorporate the new strain into the coming Southern Hemisphere vaccine. Countries with multiple influenza peaks can theoretically administer an additional dose of the new vaccine to reduce disease in the subsequent peak season. In subtropical regions, there are often 2 seasonal peaks of influenza within a year.6,7 For instance, in Hong Kong, the influenza seasons are January to March and June to August,8 and the government has opted to offer the Northern Hemisphere vaccine once a year in October to December. In early 2015, a heavy flu season occurred due to the newly drifted influenza strain, A H3N2 Switzerland that had not been included in the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. In view of the reduced level of protection as reported elsewhere,9 the Hong Kong Government decided to place an additional procurement of Southern Hemisphere vaccine that contains the new virus strain. Given the limited supply, the additional dose of vaccine was only offered to selected groups. Vaccine was planned to be administered in May to prepare for the summer peak expected in June to August of 2015.",

In a previous local study, which investigated the community responses and preparedness for a possible epidemic of H1N1 when the pandemic level was already phase 5, the public did not perceive a high likelihood of having a real outbreak, nor did they regard the infection as threatening.10 In another survey performed in Hong Kong that evaluated the acceptability of prepandemic influenza vaccination among healthcare workers, the willingness to accept the vaccine was low11 \u2013 with many concerned about the side effects and doubted the efficacy of the additional vaccine. However, healthcare workers are in general at higher risk for influenza infection than the general public,12 due to their exposure at their workplace and close proximity to patients.13,14",

The statistical significance of the associations was evaluated by Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests as appropriate. The independent factors associated with the intention to receive the additional vaccine were assessed by a binary logistic regression analysis, using variables with P values < 0.10 in the univariate analyses as covariates. We performed regression analysis where the variable selection procedure adopted was stepwise. We have used forward stepwise technique since it is best suited for studies where the sample size is not very large. All P values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant in the final regression model.",

Far fewer respondents would recommend the additional vaccine to their patients (20.3%) and family members (16.9%) who were not at high risk for severe infection.

From the univariate analysis, older age, male sex, working in a specialty other than surgery and emergency, engagement in administration or being a medical doctor, having received influenza vaccination in the past 3 years, and the perception that they were likely to contract the virus and that the infection would seriously affect their daily living were significantly associated with intention to accept the vaccine (Table 4).

The unique seasonality of influenza in subtropical regions with more than 1 peak in a year provides an opportunity to administer an additional vaccine with the latest composition to combat newly emerged antigenically drifted variants. To the best of our knowledge, the attempt of the Hong Kong Government is the first of its kind, and there is currently no study that has explored the level of acceptability of the ad hoc additional influenza vaccination under such circumstances. Most of the respondents were females, which is compatible with the female dominance in the nursing profession. The response rate to this survey invitation was nevertheless, low. There are a number of reasons which could explain this, including the busy schedules of healthcare professionals, the absence of incentives built in this present survey, and the possibility of multiple study invitations from other researchers sent to the prospective study participants \u2013 where the current round of survey invitations might not be perceived by some as having an immediate relevance to their clinical practice.",

Somewhat higher acceptance levels of pandemic vaccine have been reported among health care workers in France (36.5%),16 UK hospitals (63.4%),17 and frontline healthcare workers in Shropshire County's general practices (83.9%),18 but lower as shown in another local study conducted among nurses in Hong Kong (13.3%).19 The relatively low acceptance rate in Hong Kong could be related to the high proportion (83.5%) of respondents perceiving that the viral strain may be different in the coming season, which makes the additional vaccine relatively redundant and not cost-effective. Several studies have reported that safety concerns about a new vaccine20 and the difficulty to reconcile conflicting evidence about the vaccine21\u201323 as important barriers. Turning to the factors associated with the intention to accept the additional vaccine, the Health Belief Model (HBM) could explain the relationship between vaccine acceptability and perceived risk of contracting influenza as well as perceived severity of influenza.24 Since the efficacy, safety profile, and cost-benefit of the additional vaccine has not been fully evaluated, recommendations to encourage healthcare workers to take the vaccine will need to be further consolidated. We found that primary care physicians had a significantly higher acceptance rate than physicians of other specialties, and thus could play a key role in mobilizing colleagues working in other specialties. Our results indicate that one could invest more resources to improve acceptance among healthcare workers as the majority of them believe that influenza vaccine saves lives (86.7%) and reduces medical expenses (76.3%). This study highlighted that 80% to 90% of healthcare workers supported vaccination for high-risk patients, in contrast to low level of personal acceptance even when perceived risk of infection and severity of impact were high. This study pointed out that such discordance that may be a reasonable target for further strategies to improving vaccination campaign acceptability. Protecting healthcare workers may be an important measure to prevent in-hospital spread of infection in the face of influenza outbreak. Therefore, improving vaccine acceptance among high-risk healthcare professionals should be a priority in enhancing update of vaccination program.",

The study provides data on the factors associated with uptake and the perception of healthcare workers on the at-risk groups where vaccination should be a high priority. The sample size is adequately powered. However, some limitations should be addressed. First, we evaluated the acceptability of the healthcare workers at a relatively early stage of the programme, and there exists the possibility that their opinions and perception may change overtime. In addition, the response rate of the survey was modest, and thus a biased sample might have been recruited. Hence, a major limitation of this study included the inability of the researchers to characterize the nonresponders, since the only information we have for these nonresponders was their contact methods. Nevertheless, there are no concrete, plausible explanations why the responders and nonresponders should be different with respect to their intention to accept ad hoc influenza vaccines. Furthermore, this acceptability survey captured opinions of healthcare workers but not what they would practice in reality. Hence, future cohort studies should be performed to assess the actual uptake rate when the vaccine is available for use. Finally, there might be more in-depth barriers to receiving the additional vaccine among the healthcare workers, and these are better studied by qualitative evaluations.",
