In addition, they often serve as model organisms in molecular evolution studies.1\u20134 Therefore, understanding the way the viral fitness is encoded in the genetic material of bacteriophages (or other type of viruses) is an important and challenging mission that may potentially contribute to all biomedical disciplines.1\u20134",

During its lifecycle this phage either resides within the genome of its Escherichia coli host through lysogeny or enters into a lytic phase (which lasts \u223c25 min) during which it produces progeny viral particles, and kills and lyses the cell (see for example14,15).

Some previous studies shed some light on specific elements related to this topic. For example, a recent study by Liu et al.9 employed ribosome profiling to study the progress of bacteriophage lambda gene expression during phage development and showed that the known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion; in addition many previously unknown potential open reading frames were detected. Other studies focused on different aspects of viral translation (and lifecycle in general) regulation that has a significant effect on shaping viral genomes, such as: secondary structures within viral transcripts (mainly in untranslated regions16,17 but also within coding regions18\u201320) and evolutionary pressure on synonymous codons usage bias.21\u201325",

Thus, the distribution of this new random variable includes three parameters, and is called EMG distribution.30 In this model, the typical codon decoding time was described by the normal distribution with two parameters: mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3); the \u03bc parameter represents the location of the mean of the theoretical Gaussian component that should be obtained if there are no phenomena such as pauses/biases/ribosomal traffic jams; \u03c3 represents the width of the Gaussian component. The exponential distribution has one parameter \u03bb which represents the skewness of the NFC distribution due to reasons such as ribosomal jamming caused by codons with different decoding times, extreme pauses, incomplete halting of the ribosomes and biases in the experiment.

To this end, all early/late genes were aligned to the start codon and average values of a minimal folding energy (MFE) over all genes in each group were predicted within all possible 39-nt length local window. These average MFE values where compared in a position wise manner (Fig. 3A and B) and in average over all positions (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3) to the MFE values expected in random. Positions with significantly strong (more negative MFE) or weak (more positive MFE) folding where identified (Fig. 3A and B) and also global P-value related to the mean average MFE values was computed (Fig. 3C). To make sure that the obtained folding signals were not mainly an indirect consequence of codon usage bias and/or selection for specific dinucleotide contents not related to mRNA folding we employed two randomization models, one designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the distribution of dinucleotides and the other designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the codon usage bias (see the Methods section for more details).\n",
