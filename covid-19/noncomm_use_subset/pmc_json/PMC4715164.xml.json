Because enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection offers an inexpensive and user-friendly approach for laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological studies of respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome,28,29 we recently developed a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV N protein.30 In this study, we describe the application of N protein ELISA, real-time qRT-PCR, isothermal amplification, virus isolation, and antibody detection in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of a dromedary dairy herd in Dubai after sudden death and the detection of MERS-CoV from a dromedary calf within the herd.",

Similarly to results from previous reports, MERS-CoV was detected in a dromedary calf.39,40 This dromedary calf with MERS-CoV did not show any respiratory clinical signs and had died of cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. This is in line with our observation that other dromedary calves with sudden death and MERS-CoV detected have also died of various diseases, such as salmonellosis, clostridial enterotoxemia, and isoporiosis instead of pneumonia, and MERS-CoV was detected in the animals only incidentally (unpublished data). Notably, the MERS-CoV strain isolated in the present study clustered with other patient strains from east Saudi Arabia and Qatar, including the one from a Korean patient who acquired infection in this area. This is in contrast to the MERS-CoV strains reported in our previous study in Dubai,38 which formed another cluster not closely related to the present strain. This indicated that more than one strain of MERS-CoV is circulating in Dubai. Notably, among the three amino acid changes located at the S1 domain of the spike protein as a result of non-synonymous mutations, none are located at the receptor-binding subdomain, suggesting that the camel MERS-CoV is still likely to bind human receptor DPP4. The significance of these mutations is unclear and needs to be investigated further. The dromedaries in this study belonged to a closed herd that did not have contact with other herds because they were browsing in a confined area. It is believed that the virus could be circulating in the herd, which was probably infected in Saudi Arabia several years ago when the dams were calves. Alternatively, the deceased calf may have been infected from an unknown external source.",

Recently, we reported the development of a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV N protein and evaluated its specificity using nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with various common respiratory virus infections, including the four human CoVs, and its sensitivity using simulated nasopharyngeal specimens.30 We argue that the ELISA may be used in animal field studies. In the present study, results of the N protein ELISA showed a concordance with those obtained from nucleic acid detection using dromedary nasal samples, indicating that the ELISA was highly specific. It is notable that there is one amino acid difference (L178V) between the N protein sequence of the MERS-CoV isolate of the present study and the original MERS-CoV isolate we used to generate the monoclonal antibodies for the N protein ELISA. This N protein ELISA would probably be useful in laboratories in the Middle East and North Africa, where resources and expertise may be limited. Further refinements of the test and the development of a rapid antigen detection kit for rapid diagnoses are warranted.",
