The programme includes individual studies that may involve researchers from only one discipline and/or data collection from either human or animal populations, but the studies are designed in an integrated way within the programme so that the results of each study can be interpreted together and contribute to designing integrated approaches to zoonotic disease control.\n",

Bangladesh developed a Strategic Framework for OH Approach to Infectious Diseases in 2012 which was later endorsed by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, with the support of FAO, WHO, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (www.iedcr.org/pdf/files/One%20Health/Strategic_framework_for_One_Health_Bangladesh-26%20Jan.pdf). The Strategic Framework \u2018provides direction for prevention, early warning and control of emerging, re-emerging, and high impact infectious diseases at the human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystem interface in Bangladesh\u2019. Significant progress has been made in implementing the strategy, with the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee and an OH Secretariat in June 2016. The Secretary of Health is the initial chair of the Steering Committee which will be rotated every 3 years. The OH Secretariat initially comprising one officer seconded from the health, livestock, and forest sectors will be located at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research, with support from the USAID Preparedness and Response project, FAO and CDC.",

A similar situation was identified with respect to rabies research in India, despite efforts of the Roadmap to Combat Zoonoses in India to provide strategic direction for multidisciplinary zoonotic disease research through a strategic research agenda (4). While most animal health institutions in South Asia conduct zoonotic disease research, a large proportion of which estimates disease prevalence in animal populations, very few public health institutions conduct zoonotic disease research. As a result, there is a significant lack of reliable information on the burden of zoonotic diseases in human populations, despite evidence that the impact of some zoonoses is higher than that of malaria, and comparable to that of HIV/AIDS (47). Reliable estimates of zoonotic disease burdens in humans as well as in animals are important for formulating effective zoonotic disease control policies. There is a major need for well-coordinated and well-designed zoonotic disease research programmes, integrated within an OH framework to produce information of value in both human and animal populations for the development of effective integrated OH disease control policies.",

The OH strategies developed in Bangladesh and Bhutan provide the framework for collaborative leadership and coordinated funding and implementation of integrated OH research programmes in their countries. However, there is a clear need for ongoing national and international support to build OH research capacity through the implementation of integrated OH research programmes that are supported by education and training to strengthen these initiatives in South Asia.

Formal collaborative mechanisms were established in all South Asian countries in the mid-2000s to manage emerging disease threats such as HPAI (H5N1), H1N1, and SARS. However, sustainability of these collaborations for managing endemic zoonoses in \u2018peace time\u2019 has been very variable. Some countries have made significant progress towards building a strong OH network and institutionalising OH, while in other countries collaboration occurs as a result of individual advocates and where it is supported by donor funding. Bangladesh is the leading South Asian country with its One Health Strategic Framework signed by the three responsible Ministers in 2012 and is making steady progress implementing the strategy, with the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for One Health and a One Health Secretariat in June 2016. The government of Bhutan is also making good progress towards a government-led Strategic Framework for One Health, with a strategic document signed by the relevant ministers and awaiting approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. While Nepal has not yet developed a national OH strategy, the establishment of district-level OH hubs serving as a single platform for issues associated with zoonotic disease control is a significant development. Some inter-sectoral collaboration occurs in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and the collaborative networks, while largely dormant are activated and meet as and when required, but collaboration is not yet supported by a national government-led strategy. In India, the Public Health Foundation India leads initiatives and advocacy for an integrated OH approach to research and policy formulation for controlling zoonotic diseases. While national multisectoral committees have been established in India, these have not yet translated into effective collaborative research or policy formulation. In the absence of any governmental structure to support OH, collaboration in Afghanistan is still very ad hoc and largely dependent on donor-led advocacy and support.",
