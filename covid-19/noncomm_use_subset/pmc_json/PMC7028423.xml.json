An arterial blood gas analysis under O2 at 10 L/min with a reservoir mask showed the following: pH 7.397, PaCO2 49.8 Torr, PaO2 62.0 Torr, HCO3\u2212 29.9 mmol/L, and lactate 1.40 mmol/L. Her white blood cell count was 29,700/mm3 (neutrophils 28,400/mm3, eosinophils 0/mm3, basophils 100/mm3, monocytes 600/mm3, and lymphocytes 600/mm3), with hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL and a platelet count of 52.2\u00d7104/mm3.

Serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies were both negative. Serum autoimmune antibodies, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, were all negative. A rapid influenza test and Mycoplasma antigen test using a nasopharyngeal specimen were negative, as were the urine antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella spp. A beta-D glucan and Aspergillus antigen test were both negative. An anti-HIV antibody was negative. Chest X-ray showed bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram (Fig. 2a). Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram, and ground-glass opacities in her left lung (Fig. 2b, c). Left ventricular motion on transthoracic echocardiography was normal with an ejection fraction of 65%.",

We initially diagnosed her with acute interstitial pneumonia and started levofloxacin 500 mg daily, azithromycin 500 mg daily, and methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days. Prednisolone 40 mg daily was started from hospital day 4, after which her respiratory condition and infiltration on chest X-ray improved (Fig. 3a). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) obtained bloody BAL fluid with cell numbers of 1.48\u00d7103/mm3 (macrophages 1.3%, lymphocytes 65.8%, neutrophils 26.8%, and eosinophils 6.2%) but did not show any microorganisms on Gram staining or yield significant pathogens, including M. pneumoniae or Legionella spp. Neither hemosiderin-laden macrophages nor atypical cells were found. We performed a multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction using an FTD Resp 21 Kit and FTD Legionella Kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta), which can detect influenza virus, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus A/B, HBoV, human syncytial virus A/B, human adenovirus, enterovirus, human parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila and L. longbeachae, although only HBoV was detected. Repeated blood cultures during admission were all negative. During the convalescent phase, specific antibody titers against M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, C. psittaci, influenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, and human parainfluenza virus did not increase significantly. We therefore diagnosed her with primary viral pneumonia due to HBoV.",
