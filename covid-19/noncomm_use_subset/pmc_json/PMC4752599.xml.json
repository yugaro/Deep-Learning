Filovirus particles are characterized by a thread-like morphology, with infectious virions averaging 800 to 1,000 nm in length by 100 nm in diameter (1). The viral genome is encapsidated by several proteins, the nucleoprotein (NP), VP24, VP30, and VP35, to form the ribonucleocapsid, along with the L polymerase (2, 3). The VP40 matrix protein adds structural support through interfaces with the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope (4). Studding the viral membrane are metastable trimeric glycoprotein (GP) spikes composed of disulfide-linked heterodimers, the GP1 receptor-binding subunit, and the GP2 fusion subunit (5).",

The N-terminal HR of GP2 comprises segments that encircle GP1 along with the internal fusion loop, which packs against an adjacent GP1 monomer (7). For insertion into apposing host membranes, the fusion loop must be extricated from its position in prefusion spikes and presumably extended before GP2 refolds. The postfusion structure of GP2 trimers is marked by six-helix bundle (6HB) formation (8, 9), consistent with other class I viral fusion proteins (10), bringing the host and viral membranes into close proximity to lower the kinetic barriers to fusion. Hemifusion of the outer bilayer leaflets precedes formation of a full fusion pore for the cytoplasmic release of the viral genome.",

            "text": "Like other filoviruses, EBOV is capable of binding a variety of surface molecules, which contributes to its broad cellular tropism. C-type lectins and phosphatidylserine receptors have been implicated in attachment, though their roles in uptake have not been fully defined (11\u201314), and T-cell immunoglobulin domain-1 may act as a receptor on epithelial cells (15). Internalization of EBOV occurs primarily through a macropinocytosis-like process, and the virus traffics through the endocytic pathway (16\u201318). Proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by a class of low-pH-activated proteases, cysteine cathepsins, removes the C-terminal glycan cap and mucin domain sequences (19) to reveal a receptor-binding domain. This newly exposed GP1 domain interacts with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which serves as an obligate intracellular receptor for filoviruses (20, 21). While cathepsin cleavage and subsequent NPC1 binding are indispensable for infection, they are themselves insufficient to mediate release of the viral genome to the cytoplasm (22). A final trigger for fusion of viral and endosomal membranes by GP2 has been postulated but not demonstrated (23, 24), and which precise endosomal compartment actually supports fusion is unknown.",

In order to examine GP triggering more fully, we have used a real-time microscopy assay for the detection of GP-mediated lipid mixing within cells. This assay further enables the events of GP triggering and lipid mixing to be uncoupled from full fusion and infection. In this report, we characterize GP-mediated lipid mixing and investigate host factors thought to be involved in the process. Our findings identify essential but distinct roles for cysteine cathepsins and NPC1 in EBOV GP fusion triggering.",

To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28). The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30). Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GP\u0394Muc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GP\u0394Muc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7). On average, over 90% of DiD-labeled particles also possessed NG-P signal, and 72% of total particles exhibited triple-labeling, indicating that the preparations used were of high quality (Fig. 1A).",

Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32). Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2- to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed (Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D, solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D, dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted \u201cdequenching\u201d in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).",

The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GP\u0394Muc to dequench (t1/2) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes (Fig. 2A) (33, 34). We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GP\u0394Muc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t1/2 = 44 min, Fig. 2B), and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t1/2 = 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GP\u0394Muc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C). Precleavage of EBOV GP\u0394Muc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GP\u0394Muc.",

Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G.

Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GP\u0394Muc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 \u00b5g/ml and 85% at 100 \u00b5g/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 \u00b5g/ml and 91% at 100 \u00b5g/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45). This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion.",

We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GP\u0394Muc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material).",

GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20), suggesting that this block is due to the drug\u2019s specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.",

Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching (Fig. 5J; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the two-pore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6). Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51), was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 \u00b5M.",

Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C), 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5+ compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53). Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1+ compartments (Fig. 5K).",

The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54), exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially decreased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55).

While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35), we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection (Fig. 8B and C). Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C). Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The inability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B), however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.",

We found that the appearance of NPC1 in virus-bearing endosomes always preceded GP triggering, though the time span between the two events varied (Fig. 5K), as also reported by Simmons and colleagues through a live-cell imaging assay with GP-pseudotyped retroviruses while the current article was in preparation (53). Mingo et al. proposed that delivery to NPC1+ vesicles represented a key rate-limiting step for EBOV fusion (52), but we found a lag ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min between virus-NPC1 colocalization and dequenching. It is unknown at present whether NPC1 binding directly promotes fusogenic conformational changes in GP or primes it for interaction with additional host factors. Therefore, while the lag may represent the span of time needed for the virus to bind NPC1 as its lumenal domains appear in the compartment, it may also signify a need for one or more host factors to act on GP prior to or following GP1-NPC1 interaction.",

Previously thought to undergo triggering only quite late in the endocytic pathway (50, 53), EBOV GP could mediate lipid mixing in intermediate endosomes, as indicated by their Rab5 signal, in our live assays. Because the presence of NPC1 is an absolute requirement for dequenching in our assay, we infer that some population of Rab5+ vesicles must contain NPC1 in U2OS cells. Such colocalization is not impossible, as immunofluorescence and fractionation studies have shown that NPC1 localizes primarily, but not entirely, to late endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (49); therefore, NPC1 levels in some intermediate endosomes may be sufficient to support GP triggering. However, it is unclear whether viral genome release from relatively immature endosomes can occur following GP fusion triggering. Indeed, Simmons et al. found no evidence for GP-mediated retroviral content release from Rab5+ compartments (53), raising the possibility that virions must traffic further in the endocytic pathway to encounter host factors at levels necessary for complete fusion and genome release.",

It was proposed on structural grounds that these base-binding antibodies potently neutralize by blocking fusogenic rearrangement and membrane insertion by GP2. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that neutralizing antibodies targeting the EBOV GP base inhibit viral fusion triggering (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody were required to inhibit lipid mixing to the same extent as infection, but this may typify fusion by enveloped viruses. A recent study by Otterstrom et al. (57) examined the levels of antibody binding needed to inhibit influenza virus hemifusion. Using a pair of potent, broadly effective neutralizing antibodies, whose inhibitory profiles against influenza virus strains are very similar to those of KZ52 and ZMapp against filoviruses (58, 59), the authors showed that only high concentrations of these stem-binding antibodies were able to block the majority of hemifusion events. Although their assay (viral particles bound to a supported bilayer) differed from ours, their data strongly corroborate our results, with approximately 50 to 150 \u00b5g/ml of either anti-influenza virus antibody needed to reduce in vitro hemifusion by ~90%. The requirement for antibody concentrations beyond relevance to infection indicates a far lower threshold for lipid mixing than for full fusion and content release.",

While we likewise found that the L529A/I544A double mutant could not support infection, lipid mixing activity within cells was significantly reduced but not completely inhibited, indicating that the amino acid sequence may behave differently in native GP and in an isolated peptide, much less in an in vitro system.

We advance two mechanistic scenarios to account for our observations. First, the fusion trigger (comprising NPC1 and possibly an additional signal, e.g., acid pH, but not cysteine cathepsins) releases GP from its prefusion conformation, allowing formation of a membrane-bound prehairpin intermediate and driving hemifusion of viral and cellular membranes. A final cysteine cathepsin cleavage event then enables GP refolding to a 6HB, which mediates fusion pore formation and genome release. A similar two-step mechanism, with sequential roles for receptor binding and low pH, has been proposed for fusion by the avian sarcoma/leukosis retrovirus (61). Alternatively, it is conceivable that proteolytic cleavage of NPC1-bound GP is indeed the fusion trigger but that GP fusion triggering and 6HB formation can nevertheless occur inefficiently in the absence of cysteine cathepsin activity. Rearrangement of a few GP trimers may permit lipid mixing but not energetically costly fusion pore formation and expansion.",

            "text": "Generation of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods (26). Briefly, a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) cloning vector (Addgene plasmid 41824) encoding an NPC1-specific gRNA that targets nucleotides 768 to 790 (5\u2032 GGCCTTGTCATTACTTGAGGGGG 3\u2032 on the complementary strand) of human NPC1 mRNA was cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding human-codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 41815), a red fluorescent protein expression plasmid (to monitor transfection efficiency), and pMX-IRES-Bla (conferring blasticidin resistance to transfected cells). Following selection of transfected cells by blasticidin treatment, genomic DNA flanking the gRNA target site was amplified by PCR using forward (5\u2032 TCATAAACACACCAAACTTGGAATC 3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032 TCCTGCGGCAGAGGTTTTC 3\u2032) primers and tested for indels by Surveyor assay as previously described (26). Once genome editing was confirmed at the population level, multiple single-cell clones were isolated for NPC1 gene sequencing. A clonal cell line, NPC1-#6, was found to contain a deletion of 13 nucleotides in both of its NPC1 alleles. The deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids, in comparison to the 1,278 amino acids of wild-type NPC1. We confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using NPC1-F (5\u2032 AGGCCCCCTCAAGTAATGAC 3\u2032, specific for the deleted sequence in the NPC1-knockout cell line) and npc1-R (5\u2032 GCCCAAAGTGCTGGTCAAAG 3\u2032) primers. Amplification of the site-1 protease (S1P) gene using S1P-F (5\u2032 GATGTGCTCTGGCAGATGGG 3\u2032) and S1P-R (5\u2032 TTTCACGCCAGAACCCCGC 3\u2032) primers was used as a positive control for RT-PCR.",
