A total of 466 children with CHD received 1-5 injections of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection every 30 days, over one RSV season (October to February). CHD were identified by code based on the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The Korean guidelines for RSV prophylaxis suggest that children less than 1 year of age with HS-CHD are most likely to benefit from prophylaxis.

We recommend that the guideline should be updated based on the key findings: (i) the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection remains high among children with CHD, (ii) children with CHD exhibit a higher rate of morbidity despite prophylactic treatment than that reported in recent studies,11)18)19)20)21)22) and (iii) since the RSV season of Korea is not different with that of other countries, the national guideline might be regarded as outdated by international guidelines.23) In Korean guidelines, the patient group with HCM was not supported financially.
