            "text": "LCMV infection of adult B6 mice generates a robust CD8 T cell response, peaking at 8 or 9 d after infection and eventually establishing a stable virus-specific CD8 memory T cell pool (17, 18), where >20% of the CD8 T cells in the PBLs can be identified as specific to LCMV-encoded epitopes (Fig. 1, A and B). The hierarchy of responses against different epitopes is very similar between immunologically naive mice (Fig. 1 and reference 17), but the integrity of the LCMV epitope-specific memory CD8 T cell pool is often disrupted by heterologous viral infections, which preferentially expand cross-reactive T cells while deleting noncross-reactive ones (2, 19, 20). We have elaborated the impacts of two heterologous viruses (PV and VV) on LCMV-immune mice and found that these two viruses generated characteristic and contrasting patterns of T cell responses to epitopes in LCMV-immune mice (2\u20134). PV and LCMV share strongly cross-reactive subdominant epitopes (PV-NP205 and LCMV-NP205) that dominate the immune response when these viruses are infected in sequence (Fig. 1 A and reference 2). In contrast, VV infection of LCMV-immune mice exhibits a much less predictable pattern, where the specificity of expanded T cells is not always the same between experiments (Fig. 1 B and references 3, 4).",

We questioned here whether individual mice could differ dramatically in the patterns of their cross-reactivities to heterologous viruses and sought to compare epitope-specific responses after a heterologous viral infection to the hierarchy of the T cell repertoire in the LCMV-immune mouse before the heterologous viral challenge. To address these issues of immune responses unique to the individual, we adopted a longitudinal analysis method to reiterate the impacts of heterologous PV or VV infections on LCMV-immune mice. First, we examined the frequency and the hierarchy of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of individual LCMV-immune mice before (day 0) PV or VV infection and then at late stages of the heterologous viral challenge (Fig. 1, A and B, day 12). A peptide epitope-induced intracellular IFN-\u03b3 assay was used to identify and quantify epitope-specific T cells.",

Concomitant with the expansion, there were significant reductions in the frequencies of the rest of the noncross-reactive LCMV-specific CD8 T cells. Analyses of these three and seven other individual LCMV-immune mice infected with PV revealed that, although the level of the NP205-specific T cell expansion widely varied (2\u201341-fold, mean = 14.5 \u00b1 15, median = 6.9, n = 10) between individual mice, all of the PV-infected LCMV-immune mice unambiguously exhibited the same pattern of expansion of T cells specific to this cross-reactive epitope.",

            "text": "However, in contrast with PV infection, challenge of LCMV-immune mice with VV led to a much less predictable response, where T cells specific to different epitopes were favored in different mice (Fig. 1 B). We summarized the VV-induced changes in the hierarchies of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in 26 examined mice in Table I. Several distinctive features of heterologous immunity during VV infection were noted. First, the increase in the number of putatively cross-reactive LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells was less dramatic and more subtle than the expansion observed during PV infection. In LCMV-immune mouse no. 11, although the frequencies of NP396-, GP33-, GP276-, and GP118-specific CD8 T cells were dramatically and somewhat comparably reduced, the frequency of NP205-specific CD8 T cells remained about the same (Fig. 1 B, 105% of LCMV-immune mice). This maintenance of frequency by the NP205-specific T cells actually represents an increase in number, considering an overall increase in the CD8 T cell percentage upon VV infection. In 26 LCMV-immune control mice, the percentage of CD8 in the PBLs was 10.1 \u00b1 2.3%, whereas the percentage of CD8 cells in the VV-challenged LCMV-immune mice was 20.5 \u00b1 4.5%. Furthermore, given the fact that the total numbers of leukocytes were also routinely increased in the spleen after VV infection (LCMV-immune = 6.4 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 107 vs. LCMV-immune + VV day 12 = 15 \u00b1 107) and well reflected in peripheral blood, the increase in number is expected to be greater.",

In mouse no. 12, the GP33/34-specific response (directed at either of two overlapping epitopes) was most favored, and the 100% preservation of this GP33/34-specific response actually represents a 260% increase, taking into account the increased frequency of CD8 T cells. Sometimes there was a response directed against two epitopes, such as against NP205 and GP118 in mouse no. 17. There were no obvious alterations of T cell hierarchies in the individual LCMV-immune mice that enabled us to predict what specificity would dominate during the response to VV (Fig. 1 C).",

This can be seen in Table I, which shows the percent recovery of the epitope-specific T cells from 26 individual LCMV-immune mice before and after VV infection. Given the increases in CD8 number in the PBLs, we have highlighted the responses representing at least 1.5 times the day 0 value (Table I). It is clear that, although the T cell responses in the individual mice behave differently to VV, some epitopes, such as NP205, are much more likely to elicit a strong response than other epitopes, such as GP276 or NP396. Analyzing these data in another way, we asked which epitope generated the strongest relative response in each mouse, and a nonrandom pattern evolved, with a hierarchy of NP205 (50%) > GP33/34(23%) > GP118 (15%) > NP396 (4%) = GP276 (4%).",

Of note is that the frequencies of total CD8 T cells and of T cells specific to each LCMV epitope were reduced at day 4 after infection. This is to be expected, as the level of protection against viral replication during heterologous immunity is insufficient to prevent the challenge virus from inducing cytokines that cause across-the-board apoptosis and lymphopenia of memory T cells (21\u201323). By day 7, the percentage of NP205-specific T cells had increased from the day 4 time point, representing a marked increase in cell number from the day 0 time point, considering the substantial increase in the percent of CD8 T cells overall. These increases were similarly reflected at day 12, the chosen day for the previous assays.",

As a technique to support the concept of a TCR-mediated event, we examined the down-regulation of IL-7 receptors (IL-7R\u03b1) on CD8 T cells. Virus-specific CD8 T cells in the memory phase express high levels of IL-7R\u03b1, but these become down-regulated on TCR cross-linking. The majority of LCMV-specific memory CD8 T cells are IL-7R\u03b1hi (Fig. 2), but after secondary LCMV challenge in vivo, >50% of the LCMV-specific CD8 T cells of various specificities uniformly down-regulated IL-7R\u03b1 on their surface (Fig. 2, top left quadrant). In contrast, LCMV-immune mice challenged with PV down-regulated IL-7R\u03b1 only on the highly cross-reactive NP205-specific T cells (unpublished data). Interestingly, with a VV challenge, the pattern varied between mice. IL-7R\u03b1 down-regulation was 23\u201342% in some mice (nos. 1 and 2) on GP33/34-specific T cells, on another mouse on GP118-specific T cells (no. 3), and on another on NP205-specific T cells (no. 2) (Fig. 2, no. 2). All other epitope-specific responses were \u226412%, suggesting very low, if any, TCR stimulation. VV-stimulated LCMV-specific T cells were examined for forward scatter, as an indicator of cell size with regard to IL-7R\u03b1. The cells low in IL-7R\u03b1 expression were larger, as indicated by substantially increased forward scatter (e.g., GP33-specific CD8 T cells in no. 2 mouse, FSC of IL-7R low = 402 vs. high = 344). These data are consistent with the concept that the T cells are being stimulated through their TCR and, thus, probably proliferating even though the epitope specificity varies between mice.",

To address this issue, we designed a modified adoptive transfer system, in which the randomness in the heterologous T cell response could be addressed. CFSE-labeled LCMV-immune donor cells derived from a single donor were transferred into multiple hosts, which were infected with VV (Fig. 3 A). We reasoned that if the secondary response on VV challenge was random, variable epitope patterns would be observed among the different recipients of LCMV-immune cells derived from the same donor. If the putatively cross-reactive epitope-specific expansions were similar between recipients, this would argue against randomness and would strengthen the argument that the unique, or private, epitope-specific repertoire of the donor determines the pattern of heterologous immunity.",

In some cases, there were no responses to any of the tested epitopes. Table II also reinforces the data from Table I showing that T cell responses to NP205 and to GP33/34 are the most frequent. These data indicate that the random stochastic process generating the primary LCMV-specific T cell response from very low frequency epitope-specific naive T cell precursors is less of a factor when the heterologous virus stimulates putative cross-reactive T cells from a much higher frequency of memory T cells, which presumably get distributed in sufficient frequencies between recipient mice.

It shows that these unique private specificities, rather than being meaningless immunological curiosities, impact the recognition of cross-reactive antigens encoded by other pathogens and, as a consequence, have the potential to alter the pathogenesis of a viral infection in a manner that is unique to the individual. This work was initially based on the puzzling observation that, unlike LCMV-infected mice challenged with PV, where a clearly defined cross-reactive epitope-specific CD8 T cell response predictably dominates, VV infection of LCMV-immune mice elicits a more subtle and less predictable expansion of LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells (3, 4). Here, we used sensitive measures to analyze these less predictable responses and have revealed new insights into the complexities of T cell dynamics during virus infections. Longitudinal analyses of LCMV-immune mice before and after VV infection revealed that, although many of the LCMV-specific memory cells were profoundly reduced in frequency, others, presumably cross-reactive T cells specific to distinct epitopes, were either maintained or increased in frequency (Fig. 1). Attrition of noncross-reactive CD8 T cells after VV infection probably resulted from cytokine-induced bystander apoptosis of memory cells, shown to occur during viral infections (21\u201323). Fig. 1 D shows that cells of all specificities decline at day 4 after infection and T cells specific to only some, presumably cross-reactive, peptides thereafter increase in number. Of note is that there was considerable variation between mice regarding what group of epitope-specific T cells was stimulated by VV. This mouse-to-mouse variation in epitope selectivity was also seen in measurements of the down-regulation of IL-7R\u03b1, an indicator of recent TCR stimulation (Fig. 2) and in loss of CSFE label studies, an indicator of T cell proliferation (Fig. 3).",

The T cell repertoire is generated via random rearrangements of separate V, (D), and J gene segments of TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, by imprecise joining and random addition of nucleotides during this process, and by the pairing of TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. The mathematically predicted potential T cell diversity (1015) is far greater than the estimate of actual diversity (2 \u00d7 108) observed in mice, in part because of the limits on the total numbers of T cells (26, 27). This gap between potential and actual diversity allows for different TCR repertoires in genetically identical hosts, and experiments have shown very little overlap of naive TCR repertoires between mice (14). Upon immunization or infection, each host generates an antigen-specific T cell response with the best available T cell clones that randomly encounter epitope-expressing APCs. Even if each host appears to elicit comparable T cell responses with predictable immunodominance hierarchies and V\u03b2 usage (public specificity), there lies considerable variation (private specificity) in clonal composition among the same epitope-specific T cells between individual mice (12\u201315).",

Because the NP205 response was frequently stimulated in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice, we analyzed the TCR repertoire of MHC-tetramer\u2013sorted NP205-specific T cells and, as expected, found considerable heterogeneity between mice. It might be anticipated that challenge with a cross-reactive heterologous virus might amplify only a subset of the T cells specific to a given epitope of a previously encountered virus, resulting in a less diverse T cell response. We have not clarified that in the LCMV plus VV system, where the cross-reactivity is unpredictable, but we have studied this in PV-immune mice challenged with LCMV, which invokes a strong cross-reactive NP205 response. Our analyses have shown greatly diminished receptor diversity of the responding T cells (unpublished data), suggesting that limited receptor TCR diversity may be an indicator of a cross-reactive response.",

It is possible that VV encodes more Kb-restricted peptides that are potentially cross-reactive than Db-restricted ones. The VV-encoded A11R 198 epitope is an example of such a cross-reactive epitope, whose response differed greatly between one VV-challenged LCMV-immune mouse and another. Another possibility is that the three-dimensional structures of some peptides (such as GP34-41 and NP205) are better at selecting a wider variety of T cell clones than others and, therefore, these epitope-specific CD8 T cells could be more promiscuous in their interactions with other peptides.",

The replication of VV is reduced in LCMV-immune mice in comparison to naive mice, and T cell\u2013dependent immunopathology is more dramatic. Adoptive transfer studies have shown that both the protective immunity and the immunopathology are dependent on T cells and on IFN-\u03b3 production (1). It is noteworthy that IFN-\u03b3 can be detected in vivo in different proportions of T cells of each tested LCMV epitope specificity (NP396, GP33, GP34, and NP205) by 3 d after infection, when viral titers are being controlled (3). It is not clear whether this IFN-\u03b3 production is a consequence of T cell cross-reactivity or a nonspecific cytokine effect (28, 29). As the infection progresses, T cells of distinct LCMV-epitope specificities expand. Given the pervasive nature of T cell cross-reactivity and the fact that it takes a stronger TCR signal to stimulate proliferation than IFN-\u03b3 production (30), all of these events could be determined by cross-reactivity, but this is in need of further study.",
