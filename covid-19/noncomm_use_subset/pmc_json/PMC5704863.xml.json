Although the majority cases with FUO are progressing favorably, about 5% patients have a final ominous prognosis with a neoplastic diagnosis, establishing the importance of cautious differential diagnosis for FUO. During the process of etiological diagnosis for FUO, it is significant to carry out a systematic workup following a logical order to promote the diagnosis and treatment. Some physical signs would present concomitantly with long-term fever, such as lymph nodes enlargement, which may help reach a diagnosis, but not always.",

The fever arose without a trace and spiked 3 to 4 times per day with mild headache and dry cough, no chills, notable sweats, sore throat, hoarseness, stridor, arthralgia, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or urinary frequency, and urgency were complained. Investigations at another hospital failed to identify the cause. He had no response to any antipyretics and empiric antibiotics for suspected infections. The fever could be relieved by steroid but recurred. He lived in a rural area, worked as a peasant. History of contacts with animals (cows, sheep, insects, etc.), filthy water or food, and people with infectious diseases were denied. Upon admission, the patient was febrile (38.4\u00b0C) and diaphoretic. Percussion and auscultation of the lungs reveal no significant abnormality.

Transbronchial needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes was performed by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), and showed fibrinous inflammation with fibroplastic proliferation. Bronchofibroscopy was conducted and manifested obvious luminal stenosis with swelling, thick and pale mucosa, and, most strikingly, loss of trachea cricoid cartilage (Fig. 2), which led us to the consideration of RP, and the diagnosis of RP was confirmed by an 18F-FDG PET/CT with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes being demonstrated (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "In clinical practice, causes of FUO are usually being explored from 4 main etiological possibilities: infections, neoplasms, noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIID; e.g., connective-tissue diseases, vasculitis), and miscellaneous conditions.[7,8] In our case, negative results in detailed medical history review, repeated physical examinations, and comprehensive serological tests and culture studies, as well as nonresponse to antibiotic therapy all excluded the infectious, NIID, and neoplastic identifications. Although bilateral small nodules revealed by chest CTs indicated minor inflammation, it was unlikely to explain the long-term high fever. Fever accompanied by lymph nodes enlargement without obvious infectious signs usually lead to a potential diagnosis of lymphoma; however, unspecific inflammatory findings that revealed by the biopsy of the right superclavical and mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as the typical signs of tracheobronchial cricoid cartilage disappearance, airway wall thickening, tracheal stenosis, and deformity in this case made the diagnosis of RP much more likely than lymphoma. On closer examination by PET-CT, along with an increased degree of clinical suspicion, a diagnosis of RP was eventually reached. In parallel, fever subsided immediately after administration of corticosteroids, so did the cough and abnormal pulmonary signs, which was another indication for a nonmalignant cause of fever. More importantly, the absence of lymph nodes enlargement after corticosteroids therapy alone in this case further confirmed the diagnosis of RP rather than lymphoma.",

            "text": "RP is an uncommon connective tissue disease that can involve multiple organ systems, mostly the ears, joints, eyes, nose, larynx, and tracheobronchus,[9\u201312] with the presenting manifestations highly variable. Usually, auricular chondritis, polyarthritis, nasal chondritis, and/or ocular inflammation often inaugurate the disease. Therefore, although airway involvement by RP is not uncommon, extra pulmonary manifestations are almost always the key to the diagnosis. According to the McAdam's criteria, establishing the diagnosis requires the fulfillment of 3 or more clinical manifestations.[5] However, chondritis is absent initially in nearly half of the cases with some general and unspecific signs as the presenting symptom long before cartilaginous inflammation begins, which complicate the diagnosis. In our case, unexplained prolonged fever accompanied by multiple enlarged lymph nodes were the unspecific presentations that may confuse the clinical decision-making. The relationship between these atypical features and RP is still unknown. We consider that the fever and lymph nodes enlargement may be related to the potential release of inflammatory substances from tissue affected, and subsequent systematic inflammation overflow during the process of RP. Although histological proof remains the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis, it is not always readily accessible especially in cases like this. First, tracheal and bronchial cartilage was already disappeared. Second, the biopsy collection might induce a high risk of a worsening of edema, bronchospasm, bleeding, and respiratory failure as his airway collapsed easily without the support of cartilaginous structure.",
