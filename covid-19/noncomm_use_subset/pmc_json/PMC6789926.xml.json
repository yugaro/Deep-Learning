Since we previously observed that replication-competent recombinant CedV (rCedV) can enter ephrin-B2\u2013deficient HeLa-USU cells (30), we investigated whether CedV G could interact with other ephrins. We approached this question by coprecipitation of tetrameric soluble CedV G (sG) (35) with a panel of soluble ephrins. Fig. 1A documents that CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B2, but not ephrin-B3. Surprisingly, CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B1 as efficiently as ephrin-B2. We also detected weak interactions with the A-class ephrins, -A2 and -A5 (Fig. 1A).",

We cocultured CHO-K1 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) expressing one of the ephrins with cells transiently expressing CedV glycoproteins. CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B2 showed the highest fusion activity. Ephrin-B1 sustained similar levels of fusion activity as ephrin-B2, while ephrin-B3 did not support cell\u2013cell fusion (Fig. 2B). Ephrin-A1, -A2, and -A5 also sustained cell\u2013cell fusion, while ephrin-A3 and -A4 did not (Fig. 2C). The A-class ephrins were \u223c5-fold less efficient at supporting fusion than the B-class ephrins, as calculated from the level of fusion over the linear portion of the time course (Fig. 2D). While human ephrin-A1 did not pull down sG (Fig. 1A), it did sustain low levels of fusion (Fig. 2 A and D). It should be noted that while we operated with the tagged ectodomain of ephrin-A1 for the binding assay, we used the authentic full-length protein for the cell\u2013cell fusion assays. Moreover, the split-reporter\u2013based fusion assay is very sensitive, even low-affinity interactions that allow fusion triggering and membrane merger may be detected, and the fusion levels remained consistent within technical replicates and across independent experiments (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The unexpectedly broad receptor utilization by CedV G could be explained by a distinct structure of its receptor-binding site. To gain structural insights into the receptor recognition mechanism, we determined the structures of CedV G by itself and in complex with each of the 2 high-affinity receptors, ephrin-B1 and -B2. The CedV G ectodomain structure was determined at 3.3 \u00c5 resolution (SI Appendix, Table S1). Like the other henipavirus G proteins, the CedV G head domain adopts a 6-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure (Fig. 4A). To assess structural similarity, we determined the root-mean-square deviation (R.M.S.D) of all CedV G atoms when superimposed on the previously determined NiV G, HeV G, and GhV G structures (17, 18, 31). The R.M.S.D.s are 1.360 \u00c5, 1.272 \u00c5, and 1.678 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, CedV G has more N-linked glycosylation modifications, and these modifications have different locations, than those of the other G proteins. We observed 8 N-linked glycan moieties at asparagine residues 311, 322, 357, 403, 425, 441, 502, and 562 (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2), which is consistent with the prediction (NetNGlyc 1.0 Server). Moreover, we observed 8 disulfide bonds, including C239 to C263, C305 to C318, C310 to C376, C399 to C416, C404 to C520, C514 to C524, C586 to C595, and the long-range bond C212 to C622 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Compared with other henipavirus G proteins, an extra disulfide bond, C310 to C376, is located between blade2strand1 and blade3strand1\u2032 of the \u03b2-propeller architecture.",

The interface between CedV G protein and ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B1 buries surface areas of 1,412 \u00c52 and 1,425 \u00c52, respectively. A hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic rim, which were observed in other henipavirus\u2013ephrin interfaces (18, 38), were also found in the CedV G\u2013ephrin B1/B2 interfaces. The hydrophobic core was formed by inserting the tip of the ephrin G-H loop into the receptor-binding pocket of the G protein, whereas the hydrophilic rim involved multiple hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between either residues K103 and K113 of ephrin-B2 or residues K59 and K113 of ephrin-B1, and residues E522, E576, and E554 of CedV G protein (SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4, respectively). All electrostatic interactions involved in ephrin-B2 receptor binding are conserved between the CedV G\u2013ephrin-B2 complex and HeV G\u2013ephrin-B2 complexes. By comparing the receptor-bound and unbound CedV G, we observed no significant conformational change, even in the receptor-binding pocket region (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Furthermore, CedV\u2013G-ephrin complex structures resemble those of other reported henipavirus\u2013G-ephrin complexes (19, 31) with a similar receptor G-H loop insertion angle (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B).",

The critical P4 pocket-forming residue W504HeV/W514GhV was substituted by Y525 in CedV G (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). This substitution allows Y525CedV side-chain stabilization by pi-stacking with residue F459CedV and swings out of the pocket region. In the vertical direction, another pocket P4 boundary-forming residue, L305HeV or Y321GhV, is replaced by D328CedV, which points away from the pocket due to the lack of hydrophobic interaction. These amino acid changes result in the loss of pocket P4 and the enlargement of pocket P3 in CedV G (Fig. 5B).",

It is worth noting that Y121 sterically clashes with pocket P3 of other henipavirus G proteins, preventing ephrin-B1 from being utilized as their receptor (37). As a consequence of lacking pocket P4, the fourth G-H loop\u2013inserting residue (e.g., W122ephrin-B2, M122ephrin-B1) inserts into or stays on top of pocket P3, and is stabilized by CedV G residues P423 and T424.

Pi-stacking between Y581 in the NiV G and HeV G P1 pockets and the pocket-inserting aromatic residue (e.g., Y120 in ephrin-B3) is an important stabilizing contact for G-H loop insertion. The substitution of Y581 by N602 in CedV G (Fig. 5B) abolishes the pi-stacking, reducing the binding compatibility in the P1 pocket. For P1 pocket insertion, tyrosine residue is energetically less advantageous than phenylalanine residue due to addition of a hydroxyl group. Therefore, neither ephrin-B3 nor -A3 with tyrosine at this position of the G-H loop can be effectively utilized by CedV G. Similarly, ephrin-B3 cannot be used by GhV due to the substitution of Y518NiV by T591GhV.",

Having observed that CedV uses several ephrins as receptors, we compared the 4 key contacting residues of the G-H loop between humans and rodents. Noting a single amino acid difference in the receptor-binding G-H loop between human (T115) and mouse (I115) ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6A), we assessed whether mouse ephrin-A1 functions as a henipavirus receptor. Indeed, CedV sG coprecipitates soluble mouse ephrin-A1, but not human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6B). Further, we recorded minimal binding of CedV sG to human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6C and Table 2; Kd = 4,210 nM), while binding to mouse ephrin-A1 was more than 100-fold stronger (Fig. 6D and Table 2; Kd = 24.5 nM).",

Toward this, we constructed human ephrin-A1 (T115I) and mouse ephrin-A1 (I115T), and tested these mutants and the wild-type mouse and human ephrin-A1 in a fusion assay. Mouse ephrin-A1 supported robust cell\u2013cell fusion, while human ephrin-A1 fusion was minimal (Fig. 7 A, Left; mouse A1 [mA1] and human A1 [hA1], respectively). The T115I mutation in human ephrin-A1 increased fusion efficiency, whereas the I115T mutation in mouse ephrin-A1 had the opposite effect (Fig. 7 A, Left; hT115I and mI115T, respectively). Neither HeV nor NiV could use any ephrin-A1 as a receptor (Fig. 7 A, Center and Right, respectively). We then used the split-luciferase reporter assay to quantify fusion function more precisely (Fig. 7B). Mouse ephrin-A1 supported a rate of fusion that was \u223c7-fold faster than that supported by human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 7C). The T115I mutation in human ephrin-A1 increased cell\u2013cell fusion to levels similar to those of mouse ephrin-A1 (Fig. 7 B and C, compare mA1 and hT115I). The I115T mutation in mouse ephrin-A1 reduced its fusion levels (Fig. 7 B and C, compare hA1 and mI115T).",

Similar to these examples of Eph\u2013ephrin interactions, CedV utilizes both ephrin-B1 and -B2 and GPI-linked ephrin-A2 and -A5 as functional receptors, although a delay was observed in infection with A-class ephrins. Thus, ephrin-A2 and -A5 appear to be less efficient CedV receptors compared with ephrin-B1 and -B2, consistent with affinity binding and cell\u2013cell fusion rate analyses. GPI-linked proteins and lipid rafts have been identified as entry and egress sites for several viruses (reviewed in ref. 54); however, the in vivo relevance of A-class ephrin receptor use is unclear at this time as this evidence is being masked by the high-affinity ephrin-B1 and -B2 receptors.",

Bat-borne viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (CoV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-CoV provide well-studied examples of how mutations in virus receptors can influence tropism: Murine and human ACE-2 (56\u201359) and bat DDP4 orthologs (60), respectively, differ in key amino acids, which can influence virus cross-species adaptation. Functional receptor usage of mouse ephrin-A1 by CedV is evidence that henipaviruses utilize ephrin ligands in a species specific manner. A single substitution in the G-H loop (T115I) between human and mouse ephrin-A1 accounts for both binding to and functional use of mouse ephrin-A1 (Figs. 6 and 7) at levels similar to ephrin-B2. Comparable fusion activity between mouse ephrin-A1 and human ephrin-B2 further suggests that the decreased level of fusion activity with human ephrin-A2 and -A5 is a result of CedV G-binding affinities with ephrin-A2 and -A5, and not an effect of the GPI-linked anchor. Since the key henipavirus G-contacting residues in ephrin-B1 and -B2 are conserved in both human and mouse orthologs, disparities between mouse and human ephrin-A1 may not singularly promote a novel murine host switch.",

            "text": "Our discovery that ephrin-B2 and -B3 are not the only henipavirus receptors sheds light on the mode of interspecies transmission of these viruses. Ephrin ligand and Eph receptor interactions have major roles in developmental processes like cell migration and axon guidance, and, as a result, some ephrins have overlapping spatial and tissue expression. Notably, a distinct expression pattern of ephrin-B3 in the spinal cord may underlie CNS pathogenesis during HeV and NiV infection (12, 37, 45). Interestingly, ephrin-B1 is expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex (61), as well as in the spinal cord (62). However, HeV and NiV are unable to utilize ephrin-B1 as a receptor, while nonpathogenic CedV can efficiently utilize ephrin-B1. Structural comparisons of the GhV G receptor-binding pocket with HeV and CedV G, as presented here, and NiV G (31), additionally, suggest that GhV G would be incapable of accommodating ephrin-B1. Extended receptor usage could be postulated to enhance pathogenicity; however, this is not the case with CedV. Interestingly, the vaccine strain of measles virus has acquired broad tropism due to the use of the ubiquitous receptor CD46, which contributes to its attenuation (63, 64). Additionally, CedV does not express interferon antagonists V and W proteins, which are expressed by nearly all other paramyxoviruses. Thus, broad receptor usage and a lack of innate immune antagonism may both contribute to a lack of disease outcome from CedV infections. Therefore, both the identification of receptors that mediate cross-species transmission and the study of orthologous virulence factors (e.g., V protein, W protein) that suppress antiviral immune responses (65, 66) will greatly improve our ability to evaluate the public health risk of emerging henipaviruses.",
