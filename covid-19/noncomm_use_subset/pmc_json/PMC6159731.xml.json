Meta-analysis studies have reported the association of AD with spirochetal (Odds ratio (OR) = 10.61) or Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection (OR = 5.66) [1] and association of herpes simplex (HSV-1) infection with AD, which is augmented by possession of the APOE4 allele (OR = 2.71) [2]. Periodontitis has also been associated with AD (meta-analysis OR = 1.69 for all periodontitis, and 2.98 for severe periodontitis) [3] and is associated with increased amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) load in patients in vivo [4]. Meta-analysis has also reported a significant association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and dementia (OR = 1.71) [5]. Pathological burden (cytomegalovirus, HSV-1, Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi), C. pneumoniae, and H. pylori) rather than any individual pathogen has also been associated with AD [6].",

The Borna virus has been associated with a rare form of hippocampal degeneration [11] rather than AD, but does produce extensive degeneration of the cortical and hippocampal cholinergic innervation in rats, analogous to the situation in AD [12]. Borna virus infection of cortical and limbic brain areas produces microglial activation in the hippocampus and neocortex.

Many viruses can enter the brain via olfactory neural pathways to the basal forebrain [14], a route also employed by C. pneumoniae [15] and the cerebral entry of pathogens may also be facilitated by disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in AD, which appears to be an early feature of the disease [16\u2013 18]. Cerebral microbleeds and cortical siderosis (an increase in blood-derived iron deposition) are also a feature related to BBB disruption in AD patients [19\u2013 21]. Many bacteria depend upon the availability of free iron and such effects may contribute to their successful colonization in AD [22].",

The BBB can also be damaged by viral infection (vaccinia or HSV-1) [26] or by Porphyrymonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) [27], while other pathogens such as B. burgdorferi [28], C. pneumoniae [29], or Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) [30] have found other ways to circumvent this barrier. Pathogen infection in the elderly may also be favored by age-related immunosenescence [31]. This decreasesimmunity-related responses but also results in increases in inflammatory reactions termed \u201cinflamm-aging\u201d [31, 32]. The control of the BBB, the routes of pathogen entry and immunosenescence are covered in greater detail in a later section.",

The frequency of this allele is high in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas where malaria is endemic, but while plasma samples from APOE4 subjects inhibit the growth of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum [72], APOE alleles had no major protective effects against malaria in Gambian children [73]. APOE2 has been reported as a potential risk factor for early malaria infection in Ghanaian infants [74]. APOE4 possession may also have a protective effect against hepatitis C infection and enhances viral clearance in infected patients [75]. Old age is the principal risk factor in AD, and this too implies survival from the many infectious diseases that have been and in many regions still are among the greatest causes of death in children and adults[76, 77].",

A number of the AD genes also act as primary receptors for pathogens. These include the poliovirus receptor PVR, the HSV-1 receptor PVRL2, and complement receptor CR1. CD33 binds to the HIV-1 gp120 protein and to diverse forms of sialic acid which coats many pathogens. Others bind bacterial LPS (APOC1, TREM2) or the Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (BCAM).

This provides CSF and is the location of the blood-CSF barrier, which is exploited by pathogens to gain access to the brain. The choroid plexus plays an important role in pathogen defense [120]. Postmortem gene expression studies of the choroid plexus epithelium in AD patients show changes indicative of increasedpermeability of the blood-CSF barrier and a reduction of macrophage recruitment [121], factors that would favor pathogen entry and reduce their phagocytosis by macrophages. The hippocampus bulges into the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle [122] and this area, a keystone of AD pathology, is thus in close proximity to a major site of cerebral pathogen entry. AD genes are also enriched in a separate BBB dataset from mouse cerebral arteries. This is discussed in greater detail below. Other barriers in intestinal and pulmonary tissues, also enriched in AD genes (Fig. 1), might also be considered as potential sites of pathogen entry. Immune systems play an important role at barrier interfaces [123].",

APOE4 is also associated with enhanced in vivo innate immune responses in human subjects. Whole blood from healthy APOE3/APOE4 volunteers induced higher cytokine levels on ex vivo stimulation with TLRs (TLR2, 4, or 5) ligands than blood from APOE3/APOE3 patients [133]. Gain of function also applies to AD variant forms of complement receptor CR1, which are better able to bind complement component C1q or C3B [134]. C1q and C3B are opsonins that interact with complement cell-surface receptors (C1qRp, CR1, CR3, and CR4) to promote phagocytosis (including that of infectious agents) and a local pro-inflammatory response [135]. TREM2 variants in AD are also associated with enhanced inflammatory responses (upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines) [136]. In presenilin (PSEN1) mutant knockin mice, microglial challenge with bacterial LPS results in enhanced nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokine responses, relative to normal mice [137].

For example, in relation to B. burgdorferi selective agents, TLR5 also recognizes bacterial flagellin (Refseq) and TLR8 recognizes single stranded viral RNA [159].

These involve reactions to many of the pathogens of this study, representing many different classes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) and there appears to be no discrimination, or focus on any particular type. This would concord with the multiple and diverse pathogen species that have been detected in the AD brain and with the relationship between the AD genes or the hippocampal transcriptome with multiple pathogen species. In this analysis, a variety of pathogens were used based mostly on their relationship with AD epidemiology, but also to include diverse families (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa). Those relevant to most AD cases will presumably relate to the most common infections in the elderly. In the US, these include influenza, bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infections, gram-negative bacteremia, and infection of pressure ulcers[161, 162]. These are caused by more common bacteria, fungi, and viruses, rather than by more exotic species such as the Bornavirus or T. cruzi. Despite the potential relationship of so many pathogens to AD, their cerebral entry will still also depend upon on the multiple and manageable environmental factors that disrupt or prevent BBB malfunction. Until more extensive studies of the blood and brain microbiomes in AD, the relative importance of individual or multiple species can only be speculative. A recent investigation of the gut bacterial microbiome in elderly cognitive impairment, associated with brain amyloidosis, reported an increase in the abundance of pro-inflammatory Escherichia/Shigella taxa and a reduced abundance of an anti-inflammatory taxon; E. rectale. These changes were associated with a pro-inflammatory blood cytokine profile in subjects with brain amyloidosis [163], but to date there have been few brain microbiome studies in AD, or studies of the peripheral AD virome orfungome.",

In normal human aging, loss of barrier integrity appears to begin in the hippocampus, a crucial area in AD and in learning and memory [166]. The BBB consists of a series of capillaries, capillary arterioles, and capillary venules serving neurons throughout the brain. This network of fine blood vessels, which shows early pathological changes in AD, is in turn controlled by a perivascular neuronal plexus originating mainly from the locus coeruleus, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the basal forebrain area, each of which suffer early extensive damage in AD [167]. A recent MRI study suggests that degenerative changes in the basal forebrain including the nucleus basalis of Meynert are early events in AD that precede cortical degeneration [168]. Degeneration of the cortical cholinergic innervation originating from the basal forebrain was one of the first neurochemically characterized lesions in AD [169, 170]. The basal forebrain cholinergic system receives many olfactory inputs from the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and the pyriform cortex [171]. Damage to the olfactory bulb and the olfactory tracts and system are also early characteristic features of AD[172, 173]. Anosmia/olfactory impairment are early and predictive signs of mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD [174] and A\u03b2 deposition and tau pathology can be observed in the nasal epithelium in the majority of AD cases [175].",

Nasal inoculation with C. pneumoniae in mice also results in cerebral A\u03b2 deposition suggesting use of the olfactory route [118]. The nasal epithelial mucosa forms an important physical and immune barrier to invading pathogens [177, 178]. While immunosenescence occurs in many mucosal sites during aging, nasopharyngeal tissue function is more resistant and remains intact during aging with notable signs of immunosenescence seen only in the very elderly [179].

Both the noradrenergic locus coeruleus [181, 182] and the cholinergic connections from the basal forebrain [183\u2013 186] control the cerebral vasculature, cerebral blood flow and vascular permeability. It is thus conceivable that pathogen related damage to the basal forebrain/locus coeruleus contributes to subsequent cerebrovascular and BBB defects and to the sequential pathological anatomy in AD.

For example, certain strains of neuroinvasive B. burgdorferi are known to be able to translocate across the BBB initially via anchoring to host proteins on brain microvascular endothelial cells and subsequently via activation of metalloproteases that degrade extracellular matrix and intercellular junctions [28]. C. pneumoniae infects blood vessels and monocytes in the AD brain, and also promotes the invasion of the infected monocytes through human brain endothelial cells indicating BBB breakdown [29]. The fungal pathogen C. neoformans uses a Trojan horse strategy where infected phagocytes cross brain microendothelial barriers [30]. This pathogen may also actively disrupt BBB function be secreting fungal proteases [188, 189]. P. gingivalis also disrupts epithelial barrier function via secreted proteases (gingipains) that degrade cadherins (CDH1, CDH2,CDH5) as well as occludin, beta- and gamma\u2013 catenins, paxillin, and integrins (ITGA3, ITGB1, ITGB4) [190\u2013 192]. Gingipains have been detected in the hippocampal microvasculature of P. gingivalis-infected APOE (\u2013 /\u2013 ) mice and likely contribute to impaired BBB integrity and to the cerebral invasion of P. gingivalis in this model [27]. The prevalence of periodontitis increases with age [193]; this is again a factor that would limit effects on BBB function to the aged. Any pathogen that so disrupts the BBB might be expected to influence invasion by others.",

This increased inflammatory function also applies to microglia [194]. Certain AD gene variants are associated with enhanced pro-inflammatory responses (see above) and cerebral pathogen entry would thus be met with a doubly vigorous inflammatory response related to both immunosenescence and genetic variation. Persistently activated monocyte/macrophages have been observed in the blood of patients with early AD [195] and increased activation of microglia/macrophages, colocalized with the area of heavy A\u03b2 concentration, is also observed in the brains of AD patients [196].",

A number of studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies to A\u03b2 in the serum of the elderly [197] and in AD [198, 199].They are also observed in mild cognitive impairment patients with higher plasma levels in those who progressed to AD [200]. Serum and CSF levels of antigen-bound A\u03b2-autoantibodies were found to be significantly higher in AD patients compared to age and gender-matched control subjects [201]. It has been suggested that these autoantibodies may well be derived from antibodies raised to pathogens via antigen mimicry. Among the many pathogen proteins showing sequence homology to antigenic regions of A\u03b2 are those from B. burgdorferi, C. Neoformans, C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, P. gingivalis, and herpes viruses (HSV1, HHV6, and the cytomegalovirus) [80, 202]. Cross-reactivity between antibodies to HSV-1 and synuclein (another antimicrobial peptide [160]) has also been experimentally demonstrated [203]. Regardless of the origin of these autoantibodies, their potential to attenuate the antimicrobial effects of A\u03b2 could well contribute to systemic pathogen accumulation, thus rendering cerebral entry more likely. It has already been suggested that A\u03b2 might be used as a therapeutic antibiotic agent [204]. By the same criteria, the removal of blood-borne A\u03b2 autoantibodies by immunoadsorption, to restore such potential, might be considered as a therapeutic option in AD. Autoantibodies to the alpha1-adrenergic receptor may also play a pathological role in relation to the AD vasculature and their immunoadsorption has resulted in a stabilization of cognitive and mental condition in a small group of AD patients [205].",

Other bacterial and fungal pathogens also have different ways of circumventing or damaging the BBB. Aging related immunosenescence and autoimmune blockade of the antimicrobial effects of A\u03b2 would contribute to pathogen survival in the periphery. Nasal immunosenescence occurs at a later stage [179], thus limiting the naso-cerebral route to the elderly. The pro-inflammatory gain of function provided by immunosenescence and by certain AD gene variants suggests that cerebral pathogen entry in the aged would be met by a vigorous pro-inflammatory response that likely plays a major role in the degenerative process.",

High levels of cholesterol or homocysteine [216\u2013 219] and low levels of folic acid [220, 221] have also been associated with AD. In relation to cholesterol, atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries or of leptomeningeal vessels and in the circle of Willis has also been observed in AD. Such atherosclerotic effects can lead to the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion that is also a feature of AD [127, 222, 223]. Orthostatic hypotension has also been associated with AD, dementia and vascular dementia and this too can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion [224].

There is thus no indication of the physiological weight or importance of any gene/pathogen interaction, some of which will be more important than others. Pathogen effects may also be strain-dependent, and the size of the interactomes also varies widely. Within any large interactome there will be deleterious, neutral and beneficial effects. While HSV-1 infection causes A\u03b2 deposition and neurodegeneration [251], in its latent form, the virus can have neuroprotective effects. For example the viral latency transcript inhibits apoptosis and promotes neurite sprouting in neuroblastoma cells [252], protects neuronal C1300 and Neuro2A cells from granzyme B-induced apoptosis and CD8 T-Cell killing [253] and also protects trigeminal neurons from apoptosis [254]. The Bornavirus is capable of promoting hippocampal degeneration in Man [11]. In rats Borna virus infection decreases choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex, horizontal diagonal band of Broca, hippocampus and amygdala [255] a situation similar to that observed in AD [256] but the inflammation and microglial activation it produces can also reduce A\u03b2 immunoreactivity in the brain parenchyma of Tg2576 mutant A\u03b2 mice [13]. In adult mice, 12 months after infection, T. Gondii causes neurologic and behavioral abnormalities that are secondary to inflammation and neuronal loss. Activated microglia were also seen in perivascular areas and the brain parenchyma [257]. T. gondii infection in BALB/C mice also inducesneuroinflammation and learning and memory deficits. It also potentiates the toxic effects of low doses of intracerebrally administered A\u03b2 [258], but chronic infection can also increase A\u03b2 phagocytosis and clearance by recruited monocytes [259].",

Gene networks involved in innate immunity, inflammation and pathogen defense have been subject to positive selection pressure, although many arms of these networks are cytotoxic (for example, cytokines or free radicals), and evolution has involved a considerable trade-off between diseases/infections prevented by and tissue damage caused by excessive immune activation or inflammatory processes[276, 277].

For example, the same pathogen is not always found in all AD brains, or in different laboratories, and independent confirmation is required for several species of pathogen. Laboratory confirmation in animal models may be impossible for certain pathogens, for example the EBV or hepatitis C virus, that do not infect rodents. Nevertheless, the diversity of pathogens able to promote neurodegeneration, A\u03b2 deposition or to mimic the effects observed in the hippocampal AD transcriptome suggests that many candidates, alone or severally, could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. A polymicrobial involvement seems likely given the multiple species detected in the AD brain. Evidently, this could be assessed by microbiome studies in the periphery or in postmortem brains.",
