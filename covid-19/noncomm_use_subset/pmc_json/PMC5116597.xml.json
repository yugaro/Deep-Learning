            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common chronic viral infection in the world. An estimated 2 billion people are infected, and more than 350 million are chronic carriers of the virus[1]. Due to an insufficient immune response, some individuals with HBV infection can develop chronic hepatitis, which can eventually result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While the underlying mechanisms for HBV-induced chronic hepatitis remain unclear, several studies indicate that dendritic cell (DC) function is impaired in patients with chronic hepatitis B[2,3]. DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that can present antigen to T cells and activate naive T cells. Multiple receptor molecules on the surface of DCs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), participate in the recognition and uptake of pathogens, and can regulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules[4]. In particular, DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important CLR that is mainly expressed on the surface of mature and immature DCs[5].",

            "text": "DC-SIGN plays an important role in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)[5]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that DC-SIGN is involved in the immune escape of multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including HIV-1, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue fever virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), SARS-coronavirus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, fungus, and some parasites[6,7]. Unfortunately, the mechanisms behind immune escape mediated by DC-SIGN remain unclear. It may be that DC-SIGN directly recognizes mannose oligosaccharides found on the viral envelope of HBV. Through modifications to these mannose oligosaccharides on its viral envelope, HBV could potential evade the host immune system. Indeed, it has been shown that DC-SIGN does not recognize wild-type HBV but does recognize a high-mannose type HBV produced by the application of a class I \u03b1-mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine[8,9]. Moreover, in our previous studies, we found that the high-mannose type HBV could promote the maturation of DCs, increase IL-12 secretion, and effectively stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, and that these effects were blocked by specific anti-DC-SIGN antibodies[10]. Therefore, demannosylation appears to be beneficial to HBV to escape DC-SIGN recognition and avoid the consequent immune elimination.",

Human Class I \u03b1-mannosidases include the ER \u03b1-1, 2-mannosidase I (MAN1B1), and three Golgi \u03b1-1,2-mannosidases, namely \u03b1-mannosidase IA (MAN1A1), \u03b1-mannosidase IB (MAN1A2), and \u03b1-mannosidase IC (MAN1C1). Generally, MAN1B1 firstly trims \u03b1-1,2-mannose from Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, and then MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 trim the residual \u03b1-1,2-mannose, to generate Man5GlcNAc2-Asn. These processes are dependent on the varying levels of the mannosidase subtypes in different cell types[11]. There are glycosylation sites on the surface of HBV envelope proteins, which could be glycosylated by the host[12]. Therefore, it is not surprising that HBV infection has previously been shown to upregulate the expression of ER degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidases (EDEMs) in order to increase demannosylation[13]. However, few studies have investigated the effects of HBV on the expression of class I \u03b1-mannosidases.",

Indeed, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) has been shown to downregulate the expression of MAN1C1 to increase the expression of high-mannose type proteoglycans, and this can be reversed by the activation of the PPAR signaling pathway[14]. Based on the results of these previous studies, we hypothesized that HBV could promote the demannosylation of the viral protein by increasing the expression of \u03b1-mannosidase I in the host cells. In turn, DC-SIGN can no longer recognize the HBV glycoprotein coat, allowing the virus to escape from immune attack. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HBV infection on the expression of \u03b1-mannosidase I, and also determined the mechanisms driving the altered expression. We show for the first time that HBV infection increases the expression of \u03b1-mannosidase I via the PPAR\u03b1 signaling pathway.",

As HepG2 cells only express PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3[18], MK886 (PPAR\u03b1) and GW9662 (PPAR\u03b3) inhibitors were used to explore the effects of HBV on \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase expression after the PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 pathways were blocked.

In order to further confirm whether the PPAR signaling pathway plays a role in the HBV-mediated increase in \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase levels, we tested the effect of GW9662 and MK886 on the expression of \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase in AD38 cells.

            "text": "Most enveloped viruses, including HBV, contain envelope protein polysaccharides, which are extensively glycosylated[20]. Protein glycosylation has multiple functions, and sometimes assists in evading immune surveillance[21]. Viruses use the host cell glycosylation system to synthesize and modify their envelope proteoglycans, and thus, the structures of viral envelope glycoproteins can be affected by the glycosylation mechanisms in the host[22]. Indeed, previous studies have shown that applying low-doses of glucosidase inhibitors to host cells changes the phenotype of the viral envelope proteins[23]. This, in turn, can reduce viral infection and affect the virus assembly and/or particle release[23]. For example, the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ was previously shown to prevent the HBV from correct folding and the release of viral envelope molecules, and thus, could dose-dependently reduce the virus level[9]. On the other hand, while the \u03b1-mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine did not affect the production or secretion of HBV virus particles, it did increase its recognition by DC-SIGN, resulting in activation of the immune response[8,9]. Moreover, in our previous studies, we found that demannosylation is beneficial to HBV to escape DC-SIGN recognition[10]. Therefore, the upregulation of host \u03b1-mannosidases by HBV, as observed in this study, appears to contribute to viral escape[10].",

We examined whether the HBV envelope protein activated the PPAR\u03b3 pathway to increase the expression of MAN1C1 protein. However, we found that inhibition of the PPAR\u03b3 pathway with GW9662 did not affect the HBV envelope protein-induced upregulation of MAN1C1 expression. On the other hand, when the PPAR\u03b1 pathway was inhibited with MK886, the envelope protein could not upregulate MAN1C1 expression. Our results indicate that MAN1C1 expression is associated with the PPAR\u03b1 pathway, whereas previous studies have shown that MAN1C1 expression in endothelial cells is associated with the PPAR\u03b3 pathway[14]. We speculate that the expression of PPAR subtypes could be altered in different cell types, which could be at least partially responsible for the difference between our findings and the previous studies. We also tested the effect of MK886 on the expression of \u03b1-1,2-mannosidases in AD38 cells. Increases in the levels of MAN1C1 were inhibited by MK886 in AD38 cells.
