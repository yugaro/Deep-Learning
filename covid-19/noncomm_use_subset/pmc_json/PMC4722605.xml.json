This response can limit viral spread through mobilization of cellular defense mechanisms and elimination of infected cells (Parkin and Cohen 2001; Levy and others 2011).",

Type-I IFNs include a panel of IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u025b, IFN-\u03ba, and IFN-\u03c9, all of which signal through a ubiquitous IFNAR receptor complex, consisting of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptors. IFN-\u03b3, the only known type-II IFN, signals through its own receptor complex, IFNGR, consisting of the IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 receptors. Type-III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1-4) signal through the IFNLR receptor complex, which consists of the IFNLR1 receptor specific to type-III IFNs, and the IL10R2 receptor shared by all type-III IFNs and the IL-10 family of cytokines. The signaling of type-III IFNs is restricted compared with other IFNs because expression of IFNLR1 is largely limited to epithelial cells, such as of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. IFN activity in these cells, which are commonly exposed to exogenous pathogens, is important for prevention of viral entry and dissemination.",

The human-specific TT allele, which eliminates IFN-\u03bb4 protein by a frameshift in the first exon, appeared only 60,000 years ago (Key and others 2014). Apparently, this event was beneficial because it was favored by positive selection, which has resulted in a rapid increase of the TT allele frequency (or a rapid loss of the \u0394G allele) in human populations (Key and others 2014).",

Carriers of the \u0394G allele have impaired ability to clear hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013; Aka and others 2014). Chronic HCV infection eventually increases the risk of death due to liver failure and liver cancer, but this process takes decades, thus improvement of HCV clearance due to genetic inability to produce IFN-\u03bb4 could not be the reason for the positive selection observed for the rs368234815-TT allele (Key and others 2014). The strength of this selection indicates that IFN-\u03bb4 might have interfered with clearance of other more deadly pathogens, suggesting that elucidation of IFN-\u03bb4 function could be important for understanding, prevention, and treatment of some existing and emerging infections.",

We observed differential biological activity of the IFN-\u03bb4 orthologs: compared with human IFN-\u03bb4, proteins from chimpanzee, orangutan, marmoset, and cynomolgus showed similar levels of biological activity (ISRE-Luc activation), while the dog protein showed significantly higher activity (by 40%). Orthologs from rhesus, panda, and elephant were significantly less active (25% compared with the human IFN-\u03bb4, Fig. 2). Biological activities of the IFN-\u03bb4 orthologs measured in this experiment are likely to be affected by differential affinity of these proteins to human receptors and do not represent quantitative comparisons.

However, it remains largely unknown what factors induce endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 expression in different conditions and why elimination of IFN-\u03bb4 was a beneficial event in humans strongly supported by positive selection. Answers to these questions might be relevant for dealing with existing and emerging infections across species. Viral infections have been directly responsible for some of the most dramatic and deadly disease pandemics in human history and many of these infections, including the recent Ebola outbreak, are of zoonotic origin (Jones and others 2008). There are also indirect devastating effects of these infections through the loss of livestock and wildlife, causing food shortages and financial distress (Frolich and others 2002; Thumbi and others 2015). Some animals and corresponding derived cell lines are used for studies of human infections and vaccine development (Meurens and others 2012; Gerdts and others 2015).
