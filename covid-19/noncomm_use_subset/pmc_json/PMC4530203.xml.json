Despite advances in treatment of VL over the last decade, drug toxicity and heat stability, difficult routes of administration and variation in drug efficacy between endemic areas remain issues to be fully solved. A preventive and therapeutic leishmaniasis vaccine prospectively represents the most cost-effective and successful measure to control the leishmaniases worldwide.3",

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization recommend the evaluation of distribution and persistence of DNA vaccines as well as their local reactogenicity and systemic toxicity.8, 9 Results of corresponding studies suggest that DNA vaccines are safe,10, 11 which has been confirmed in several clinical trials.12 However, immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was often modest in humans, necessitating better delivery methods and improved vaccine antigen expression.12 In addition, safety concerns prompted avoidance of antibiotic resistance genes and other selection markers for plasmid propagation.13 State-of-the-art plasmids are consequently more efficacious, safer and smaller than classical plasmids.14 Minimalistic Immunogenically Defined Gene Expression (MIDGE) vectors represent one of the most rigorous concepts for improvement.15 MIDGE vectors are small linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules, solely containing sequences required for their function in vivo and no bacterial plasmid backbone sequences as they have been shown to negatively impact transgene expression and immunogenicity.16, 17 MIDGE-Th1 vectors are MIDGE vectors with a short peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) covalently attached, enhancing the immune responses to encoded antigens.18, 19 Recently, preclinical data on biodistribution and toxicity of MIDGE and MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been published,20, 21 indicating an excellent safety profile after a single administration.",

Comparing placebo-treated to LEISHDNAVAX-treated animals, no differences were observed in body weight, food and drinking water consumption, ophthalmological and auditory examinations, urinalysis, organ weights and the neurological screening. No local intolerance reactions were noted after single or repeated vaccine dosing. Minor deviations in single animals/groups for few blood parameters (large unstained cells, albumin/globulin ratio, \u03b1-amylase) were classified as not vaccine-related. Macroscopic post mortem examination of organs revealed an enlarged spleen in a single male animal 1 day after single administration of 100 \u03bcg LEISHDNAVAX, which possibly indicated the activation of the lymphatic system. In all animals the histological findings were within the normal range of variation. No LEISHDNAVAX-related morphological lesions were found. No signs of auto-immune reactions were observed, and there were no elevated levels of serum antibodies against dsDNA detected.",

Though only a side-by-side comparison would be conclusive, we propose that these parameters strongly affected the time to overall clearance than the DNA dose. In fact, the rats in our study received up to 0.6 \u03bcg LEISHDNAVAX DNA per gram body weight, thus a lower relative DNA dose than that administered to mice of the referenced study (~1.6 \u03bcg tumor necrosis factor alpha MIDGE DNA per gram body weight).20",

The highest dose of 100 \u03bcg corresponds to a human dose of ~300 mg DNA on a mg kg\u22121 body weight base. Doses in published clinical trials ranged from 0.1 mg33 to 4 mg34 of plasmid DNA, so our study design includes a high safety margin. To further extend the safety margin, the vaccine was administered in a condensed schedule of five vaccinations (one more than the estimated maximum number for clinical application) in weekly intervals. Importantly, a No Observed Adverse Effect Level, that is, the highest dose without significant toxicity, was not reached with the doses tested. No local intolerance reactions related to the vaccine were observed. The results established in naive mice are corroborated by safety data obtained from the biodistribution study. Rats received 120 \u03bcg LEISHDNAVAX, corresponding to a human dose of ~24 mg (based on mg kg\u22121 body weight). There were no vaccine-related toxic effects observed either. Our results further confirm the findings of other investigators reporting excellent preclinical safety profiles of DNA vectors.10, 11, 20, 26, 27, 30",

We evaluated the tolerability of LEISHDNAVAX in two different mouse strains, chosen for their inherent differences in cytokine responses to infection with L. donovani.38 These experiments demonstrate that LEISHDNAVAX had no effect on the kinetics of the parasite burden with no vaccine-related enhancement of infection at any of the time points investigated. The kinetic of infection corresponded to the well-documented pattern in mice with a rapid increase in hepatic parasite burden, followed by a decline in parasite numbers and clearance and a slower increase in parasite numbers in the spleen with the establishment of chronic infections.23 Results for all other standard parameters were similar for treated and non-treated mice, demonstrating a good tolerability of the vaccine candidate in infected animals.",

A TaqMan-based quantitative realtime-PCR assay was established and characterized using a standard curve of LEISHDNAVAX ranging from 10 vector copies per reaction to 1.05 \u00d7 1011 vector copies per reaction with 200 ng genomic DNA from the livers of naive animals as background. Measurements were carried out with 200 ng of extracted total DNA in 384 well plates with a reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl on an AB7900HT instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) and hydrolysis MGB probe (Life Technologies) were designed to detect a consensus sequence present on each MIDGE-Th1 vector.

Limit of detection and lower limit of quantification of the assay were determined at 525 copies of MIDGE-Th1 vector per reaction (that is, 2625 copies per \u03bcg total DNA). All samples of extracted DNA were measured in triplicates.

Acceptability criteria of measurements included standard curve coefficient of correlation \u2a7e0.95 and detected copy numbers of No-template-controls below the limit of detection.
