Clinical symptoms of fever, anorexia, lethargy, leucopenia and digestive problems were seen in horses affected by ECoV in\nseveral outbreaks in the United States [12, 13] and Japan [7, 10, 11], and in an experimental challenge study [9]. About 20 to 30% of draft horses kept at a racecourse in Japan were affected in one ECoV outbreak [10, 11]. Those results indicate that ECoV is a highly contagious virus. Although most infected horses recovered, ECoV occasionally led to fatal symptoms like\nnecrotizing enteritis and hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the United States [2, 3]. Vaccination is one of the most important ways of minimizing the symptoms\nof infectious viral diseases, but a vaccine against ECoV is so far not available anywhere in the world.",

In horses inoculated with 1 ml of vaccine, the geometric mean antibody titers against BCoV at 0, 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56 dpi were 4, 5, 32, 102, 645 and 323, respectively, and the geometric mean antibody\ntiters against ECoV were 4, 6, 20, 25, 40 and 51 (Table 1). Compared with the antibody titers at 0 dpi, the antibody titers against both BCoV and ECoV significantly increased at 14, 28, 42\nand 56 dpi. In horses inoculated with 2 ml of vaccine, the geometric mean titers against BCoV were 8, 161, 323, 203, 406 and 512, respectively, and the geometric mean titers against ECoV were 4, 16, 32, 25, 64 and 64\n(Table 1). The antibody titers against BCoV significantly increased at 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56 dpi, and the antibody titers against ECoV significantly increased at 14, 28, 42 and 56 dpi in\ncomparison with the antibody titers at 0 dpi. This study showed that in all horses inoculated with the BCoV vaccine antibody titers against ECoV increased from 14 dpi, although the antibody titers against ECoV were lower than those\nagainst BCoV. Maximum antibody titers against ECoV in each horse ranged from 32 to 128. An experimental inoculation study conducted earlier also showed that neutralizing antibody titers against ECoV strain NC99, which is the same\nstrain as used in this study, were 32 to 128 in three horses at 14 days after their inoculation with ECoV-positive feces [9]. However, in horses naturally infected by ECoVs in the 2009 and 2012\noutbreaks in Japan [10, 11], the geometric means of neutralizing antibody titers were 304.4 (6 horses) and 348.4 (9 horses), respectively. Thus, the\nantibody titers of horses inoculated with the BCoV vaccine were similar to the titers of the experimentally infected horses but were lower than the titers of horses naturally infected in actual outbreaks. An experimental challenge\nstudy using cattle inoculated with inactivated strain No. 66/H showed that inoculated cattle possessing neutralizing antibody titers of more than 640 showed no clinical signs after challenge with a virulent BCoV, whereas in contrast,\ninoculated cattle possessing neutralizing antibody titers of less than 160 developed watery diarrhea and fever [15]. Needless to say, the animal species, strain of challenge virus, and method of\nvirus neutralization test in that study are different from our present study. Nevertheless, the antibody titers of all vaccinated horses in the present study were no more than 128, and we therefore consider that the BCoV vaccine will\nhave limited efficacy against ECoV infection in horses. To clarify this, ECoV challenge studies in horses inoculated with the BCoV vaccine will be needed to evaluate the efficacy the vaccine.",

In contrast, two out of the three horses inoculated with 2 ml of the vaccine exhibited\nswelling at the inoculation site after the second vaccination. None of the horses developed a fever after the vaccinations. Administration of more than 2 ml of the vaccine to horses would likely increase the risk of\nadverse reactions. As described above, a significant increase in antibody titers against ECoV was observed from 14 dpi irrespective of whether 1 or 2 ml was administered. Additionally, the differences in antibody\ntiters against ECoV at each dpi from 14 dpi were less than twofold between horses inoculated with 1 and 2 ml. These results suggest that inoculation of 1 ml is suitable for horses as well as for\ncattle.",

That horse was born and had been kept at a farm\nthat reared cows before coming to our facility. In Saudi Arabia, dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 was detected in apparently healthy horses kept at facilities that reared camels, sheep, goats, and chickens [5]. HKU23, which is closely related to BCoV, is endemic in camels of the Middle East [16] and the HKU23-positive horses frequently came into contact with camels and other\nanimals [5]. HKU23 may have been transmitted from infected camels to those horses. Horse No. 5 in the present study may have also been in contact with infected cows, and BCoV may have been\ntransmitted from infected cows to the horse. However, because there is no epidemiological information, it is unknown whether there were in fact BCoV-infected cows at the farm or whether horse No. 5 had shown any clinical signs.",
