There is no convincing evidence to support that integrative TCM/WM treatment could significantly decrease the mortality rate, which contrasted from the findings from Liu et al. study.4 Although we first noted a significant reduction in mortality rate with the integrative treatment when ten studies were included, further subgroup analyses failed to consistently find a significant difference in mortality rate in those RC studies with larger sample sizes and adequate information of randomization. This suggests that the previously observed positive effects of integrative treatment were likely due to the inclusion of those studies of poor quality.",

The questions of how clinically relevant the observed benefit of integrative treatment in reducing the average daily dose of corticosteroids were, and whether it could lead to a lower risk of developing corticosteroids-related adverse events, have not been answered yet in this study.",

First, due to the limited number of published RCT studies, our analysis also included some NRC studies. However, the sudden outbreak of this new and serious disease precluded well controlled clinical studies during the epidemic. Despite twenty-four clinical studies, most of them had low methodological quality according to the Jadad scores. Second, the variation in treatment regimens, particularly the wide range of TCM in concoction constituents, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy, became a major obstacle to a clear interpretation of the results. Third, there were only three studies that reported the outcomes on the basis of severity of disease. The data were insufficient for conducting an effective subset analysis on the severity of disease. Fourth, diagnoses of SARS during the outbreak were not confirmed by laboratory evidence of the SARS-Cov infection. As a recent study indicated, out of 28 patients, only 24 (85.71%) were eventually confirmed as having SARS according to the T-PCT detection of SARS-Cov RNA.41 Fifth, because of the variety of TCM and WM under study, it would have been difficult to meaningfully measure the rate of adverse events related to treatments. Therefore, such an analysis of adverse events was not conducted as part of this present study.",
