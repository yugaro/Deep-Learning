            "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been long ago recognized as a systemic inflammatory entity and as such, it is anticipated to induce changes exceeding the boundaries of bowel mucosa, being reflected in a broader spectrum of tissues, including blood[1-7]. Examples of such changes are the fluctuations in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins, S100 proteins, metalloproteinases, angiogenins, etc[4-7]. Since a different task is carried out by each of these biomarkers, it has been proposed that IBD induces multifarious responses which in turn, may affect the levels of different compounds via feedback mechanisms, consumption or reprioritisation of synthesis[4-8]. These observations along with the inflammatory nature of IBD itself seem to encourage the study of novel proteins that tend to become affected by the establishment of systemic inflammation[3,8]. Such a candidate is fetuin A or \u03b12-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), a substance synthesized in the liver, bone marrow and fetal organs, exhibiting properties similar to those possessed by negative acute-phase proteins[9]. AHSG has been shown to carry out various immunologic tasks, including regulation of macrophage-related lipopolysaccharide-triggered opsonisation, TNF-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) levels[10-13]. AHSG is also an inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification such as that taking place in coronary arteries and heart valves, while at the same time promoting mineralization within fibrils and subsequently, proper bone formation[13-15]. Other recently discovered properties of AHSG include a binding ability to insulin receptor, modifying its sensitivity, participation in wound healing as well as tumor growth processes, through the induction of a more effective cell migration[8,9]. Increased AHSG levels have been recorded in fetal organs (probably reflecting an additional role for AHSG in normal organ development), in adults with either metabolic syndrome or increased insulin resistance alone, patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus as well as individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events: stroke and acute myocardial infarction[8,9,16]. Low levels of AHSG have been recorded in patients on hemodialysis, those with cirrhosis, hepatoma or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an entity sharing common inflammatory pathways with IBD, and have been linked to vascular - excessive valvular and coronary artery calcification, ischemic events- and skeletal disorders - osteopenia[14,17,18]. Moreover, similar phenomena: upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, remodelling in intestinal microvessels, both on an acute and chronic basis, as well as manifestations linked to mineral homeostasis i.e., osteoporosis and urolithiasis, are all exerted in IBD. When bearing in mind these characteristics, the idea of examining AHSG levels in IBD, seems more than tempting[4,19-23].",

All individuals participating in the study lacked any known disease i.e., end-stage renal disease, RA, cirrhosis, hepatoma, liver metastases potentially affecting AHSG levels, with the exception of diabetes mellitus (DM), which was treated as a confounding factor and was embedded in the models used for multivariate testing.

After additional washing, incubation with a substrate solution took place, the reaction was stopped and the developed colour was quantified spectrophotometrically. The enzymatic activity of the detecting antibodies, bound to the AHSG on the wall of the microwells, was directly proportional to the amount of AHSG in the sample. A calibration curve which was generated by plotting the absorbance vs the respective human AHSG concentration for each calibrator, allowed sample AHSG determination.",

Using multiple linear regression and a backward selection process independent variables affecting AHSG levels - confounders - were identified.

For the associations originating from multiple linear regression, partial correlation coefficients - quantifying the relationship between two variables while controlling for other factors- are reported. Whenever a categorical parameter was treated as dependent variable, logistic regression analyses, simple and multiple, were applied and odds ratios (ORs) as well as 95%CIs, unadjusted/adjusted for confounding, were calculated.

Since these results are suggestive of a link between a more profound downregulation of AHSG levels and the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment or surgical intervention, AHSG concentrations were classified into quartiles. Using logistic regression, AHSG levels in the lowest quartile were found to be an independent predictor of the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment, in a model adjusted for other treatment modalities, age, sex, smoking status and disease duration (OR = 5.22, 95%CI: 1.58-17.3, P < 0.01).

An additional finding further confirming the tight link of AHSG with TNF\u03b1, was the discovery of a binding site for TNF\u03b1, within the AHSG gene. As a consequence of TNF\u03b1's binding on this region, the expression of AHSG gene is suppressed, leading to decreased AHSG production while other substances are favored-repriorisation of liver synthesis[8,11-13]. Due to the magnitude and rather IBD-selective character of this suppression, however, an evaluation of AHSG's ability to differentiate between entities has been performed. When a cut-off of 0.44 g/L was used, AHSG levels were shown to discriminate IBD from IBS and HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%.",

This may be, at least in part, due to limitations of the indices themselves although one should bear in mind that apart from the negative acute phase protein properties attributed to AHSG, its downregulation is also a part of a more complex liver deregulation, resulting from an excessive uptake and processing of signals[8-18].

A further downregulation of AHSG was observed, in CD patients with stricturing or penetrating disease, compared to those with the ns/np subtype. This is not surprising as a more diffuse transmural inflammation would exert a stronger proinflammatory effect[33]. Moreover, in many organs inflammatory stress leads to fibrosis and subsequently tissue calcification[34]. From another pathogenetic perspective, a reason for the observed link between AHSG and stricturing disease could also be the reduced AHSG-induced counteraction of TGF-\u03b2's fibrogenic and antiproliferative potential[12,13,19]. Likewise, microvascular calcification, reduced blood flow and microthrombosis, exerted phenomena in the presence of low AHSG levels are also major findings during a chronic phase in the intestinal vasculature of IBD patients, leading to diminished intestinal perfusion and in turn to ulceration and fibrosis[21,35].",

Although, initial reports originated from animal studies and those recruiting dialysis patients, similar results were obtained in patients with ischemic heart disease, alone[37]. Since a decrease in circulating AHSG is present in IBD, it would be logical to hypothesize that an accompanying reduced inhibition of vascular and valvular calcification would also be present.

Under the influence of AHSG, a \"reliable\", stress-resistant bone structure is formed, while in the absence of AHSG, minerals deposit outside fibrils, leading to defective osseous formation and finally osteoporosis[15]. As IBD patients are at high risk for osteoporosis, resulting from corticosteroids, malnutrition and inflammation-induced osteopenia[22] the examination of possible contribution of AHSG suppression for the onset of osteopenic manifestations might prove fruitful. In a rather similar manner, a defective coordination in mineral use, predominantly that of calcium, due to decreased AHSG levels, may lead to urolithiasis. Indeed, in the study of Stejskal et al[39] lower levels of AHSG in urine have been associated with the presence of urolithiasis. Although, in the case of IBD, well-established mechanisms- i.e., hyperoxaluria, reduced citric acid etc[18] - for urinary compications exist, when bearing in mind that still 80% of urinary stones consist of calcium salts it is within reason to test for additional candidates involved in calcium homeostasis and urinary manifestations, such as AHSG[40].",
