After entry into the cell, the virus releases its genetic contents, such as DNAs or RNAs, into the cytosol. The host cells possess a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are able to detect viral infection by acting as viral nucleic acid sensors. Three major classes of PRRs have been identified and intensively studied. They include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (2).",

TLR could induce the production of type I interferon by MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent mechanisms. Differently from TLR3/TLR4, which use TRIF as an adaptor, the other TLRs induce beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) production through the adaptor MyD88. TLR3 can bind viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce type I interferon production, while TLR4 mainly binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate the IFN-\u03b2 response.

The RLRs consist of at least three members, including RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA and short dsRNA (4, 8), while MDA5 senses long dsRNA (9). An adaptor protein, MAVS, is required for the activation of the RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway. The association of viral nucleic acids with MAVS promotes the aggregation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane (10). The \u201cligation\u201d of TRAF3 with the aggregated MAVS may promote the phosphorylation of IRF3 that is required for IFN-\u03b2 production (11). A recent study also shows that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived adaptor protein, STING, could also function downstream of MAVS to promote IRF3 phosphorylation and the subsequent IFN-\u03b2 response (12).",

            "text": "Pathogen-derived proteins such as virus-encoded proteins are frequently documented as negative regulators in subverting type I interferon (IFN-I) induction by interfering with a certain key component(s) of IFN-I activation signaling cascades. Viral evolution may develop a unique strategy to inhibit host innate immunity by generating virus-derived antagonists to some key signaling molecules. The vaccinia virus encodes two Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domains containing proteins A46R and A52R, which can negatively regulate TLR signaling by two distinct mechanisms (13). The vaccinia virus A46R inhibits TLR signaling by physically interacting with the BB loop of TIR containing adaptor proteins such as MyD88 adaptor-like (MAL) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) to disrupt receptor-adaptor (e.g., TLR4-MAL and TLR4-TRAM) interactions (14, 15). Differently, the A52R protein may function as a dominant negative MyD88 to directly interact with TRAF6 and IRAK2 (16, 17). On the other hand, the vaccinia virus N1L protein, another protein homologous to A52R, employs a different anti-IFN-I strategy by targeting both the TBK1/I\u03baB kinase (IKK\u03b5) and IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2 complexes to inhibit IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling, respectively (18). Alternatively, virus may invade the cells to target the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor signaling pathways for the prevention of IFN-I induction. For example, the influenza virus nonstructural protein NS1 can sequester either the dsRNA or 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA products of viral infection which can be sensed by or directly bound to the RNA helicase sensor RIG-I to inhibit RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production (8, 19, 20). The paramyxovirus V protein inhibits IFN-\u03b2 induction through the blockage of MDA5, another RIG-I-homologous cytosolic dsRNA sensor (21). A recent study revealed that the transcriptional factor IRF3 might be alternatively targeted and inhibited by the paramyxovirus V protein to impede IFN-\u03b2 gene transcription (22).",

In this study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV M protein, rather than its mRNA, activates IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB responses through TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascades. The driving force for M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction was most likely generated from the inside of the cells. Using SARS-CoV pseudovirus as an infectious agent, we further show that single point mutation at the valine 68 residue of M protein markedly inhibits virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Overall, SARS-CoV M protein may stand out as a novel cytosolic PAMP in mediating the IFN-\u03b2 immune response.",

To further confirm the result, using either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or poly(I:C) as a negative or positive control, respectively, we demonstrated that M gene products specifically promoted IFN-\u03b2 production, since cotransfection with M small interfering RNA (siRNA) completely abolished M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction at both protein (Fig. 1A, comparing lanes 3 and 4) and mRNA (Fig. 1B) levels. Moreover, after a 48-h transfection, cell supernatants were collected and assayed for the presence of IFN-\u03b2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Figure 1C clearly demonstrated that delivering pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293T cells specifically and significantly promoted the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 into cell culture medium. In addition, the promoter sequence of IFN-\u03b2 was placed upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter to generate the pGL3-IFN-\u03b2-Luc construct. To test the specificity of M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction, other viral envelope-associated genes such as the spike (S) and envelope (E) protein genes as well as the M mutant [M(V68A)] from the GZ50 isolate were also included (27). The result of a dual-luciferase assay using the Renilla luciferase gene as a transfection control demonstrated that the SARS-CoV M gene rather than the S and E genes markedly increased IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig. 1D), whereas the valine-to-alanine alteration at residue 68 of M protein completely abolished this induction, indicating that the specificity of M gene products played a role in this process. Consistent with these results, Western blotting and ELISA further validated the above observation (Fig. 1E and F). To detect if the SARS-CoV M gene has a direct effect on NF-\u03baB activation, pCMV-Myc-M was cotransfected with pNF\u03baB-luc, which contained five copies of NF-\u03baB recognition sites, into HEK293T cells. The results of the dual-luciferase assay revealed that the SARS-CoV M gene specifically and dramatically upregulated NF-\u03baB activity compared with the controls (Fig. 1G). Moreover, M could mediate IFN-\u03b2 induction in both dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1H and I). Overall, the data strongly indicated that the SARS-CoV M gene product was sufficient to promote IFN-\u03b2 gene expression.",

Figure 2A clearly demonstrates that SARS-CoV M gene products not only enhanced the phosphorylation level of TBK1 but also promoted the activation of both NF-\u03baB p65 and IRF3, indicating that M gene products may stimulate IFN-\u03b2 activation by promoting its enhanceosome activity. To further define the activation level of M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction, specific siRNAs that selectively targeted either TBK1 (Fig. 2B and C) or IRF3 (Fig. 2E and F) mRNAs were generated. Individually diminishing either TBK1 or IRF3 mRNA expression by siTBK1 or siIRF3 significantly reversed M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction (Fig. 2D and G, respectively), indicating that M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction functions at a level at or above the signaling molecule TBK1.",

            "text": "RLR and TLR are two main PRRs recognizing the majority of extracellular and intracellular PAMPs. Upon the ligation of a PRR with its specific PAMP, both RLR and TLR pathways transmit the signal to a common class of adaptors called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) including TRAF2/TRAF5, TRAF3, and TRAF6 (28, 29). To test the effect of M on RLR and TLR signaling as well as TRAF expression, an increased dose of pCMV-Myc-M constructs was first transiently transfected into HEK293ET cells. The results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that the increased delivery of pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293ET cells markedly enhanced TRAF6 but not TRAF2 and TRAF3 expression, indicating that TRAF6-mediated signaling transduction might contribute to the upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 production. To further address how TRAF expression is associated with RLR and/or TLR signaling pathways, the M gene-transfected HEK293ET cells were also assayed for the expression of upstream sensors and/or signaling molecules of TRAFs. Figure 3B demonstrates that no significant alteration was observed in the expression of RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS after exogenously delivering M genes into HEK293ET cells, indicating that the RLR signaling pathway might not be targeted by M gene products. In contrast, three adaptor proteins (MyD88, TRAM/TICAM2, and TIRAP) associated with TLRs were all upregulated (Fig. 3C), while the adaptor protein TRIF failed to be upregulated in responding to M gene overexpression (Fig. 3D). Overall, the results indicate that TLR signaling pathways are mainly targeted by the SARS-CoV M gene product for the induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression.",

The delivery of the M gene product is effective in stimulating the activation of both IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB in murine J2-M\u03c6 cells (Fig. 4A, B, and C). Figure 4D demonstrates that increased delivery of M gene product into J2-M\u03c6 cells indeed promotes IFN-\u03b2 induction through the phosphorylation of IRF3, NF-\u03baB p65, and TBK1. In accord with the results in HEK293ET cells, the increased delivery of pCMV-Myc-M into J2-M\u03c6 cells markedly enhanced TRAF6 but not TRAF2 and TRAF3 expression (Fig. 4E). Moreover, the M gene product did not significantly increase the protein levels of RIG-I, MAVS, STING, and MDA5 (Fig. 4F), indicating that the RIG-I signaling pathway might not be activated in responding to exogenous delivery of the M gene product into J2-M\u03c6 cells.

To address this issue directly, we created an M-stop construct by replacing the start codon AUG with three in-frame tandem stop codons at the 5\u2032 end of the M gene (Fig. 5A). This expression construct can generate only mRNA and no protein due to the translation failure of the mRNA substrates. Western blot analysis shows that the M protein synthesis was completely blocked in the M-stop construct but not the wild-type M construct (Fig. 5B). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis shows that the M-stop construct did not induce IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK293T cells, indicating that M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production is dependent on M protein rather than M mRNA (Fig. 5C).",

Since M protein could activate the TLR pathway from inside the cells, it remained unclear whether or not this activation is in a TRAF3-dependent or -independent manner. To address this issue directly, a specific siRNA against TRAF3 was successfully constructed (Fig. 7A). A dual-luciferase assay was conducted to assay the effect of siTRAF3 on M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction in HEK293T cells. Figure 7B clearly shows that the increased delivery of siTRAF3 did not reverse the M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction, indicating that TRAF3 might not be essential for this activation. To further confirm the above result, Western blot analysis was performed to detect IFN-\u03b2 expression in responding to the increased delivery of siTRAF3 into HEK293T cells. The increased delivery of siTRAF3 into HEK293T cells failed to inactivate the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB p65 and did not affect the M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction (Fig. 7C), while a result was obtained consistent with the increased delivery of siTRAF3 into J2-M\u03c6 cells (Fig. 7D). In addition, a stable HEK293 cell line with TRAF3 knocked down by siTRAF3 was also established (Fig. 7E). A dose-dependent increase in IFN-\u03b2 production was observed with the increased delivery of M gene into 293 siTRAF3 stable cells (Fig. 7F). Thus, the above data strongly indicate that TRAF3 is not required for M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

Earlier results demonstrate that valine-to-alanine mutation at residue 68 [abbreviated as M(V68A)] inhibited IFN-\u03b2 induction (34). We employed a SARS-CoV pseudovirus system to mimic the real SARS-CoV infection. Cell lysate supernatants isolated from either M, N, and S cotransfection or M(V68A), N, and S cotransfection were first incubated with 293-ACE2 stable cells (Fig. 8A) for 4 h. Then, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 24 h before harvesting. The SARS-CoV pseudovirus VLP(S-M-N) markedly upregulated IFN-\u03b2 expression at both RNA and protein levels (Fig. 8B), whereas the point mutation at the valine 68 residue of M protein completely diminished SARS-CoV pseudovirus-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction, strongly indicating that the M protein residing on SARS-CoV virion could specifically induce IFN-\u03b2 production upon infecting the targeted cells. Taken together, our data indicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a novel cytosolic PAMP to activate IFN-\u03b2 induction through an intracellular TLR-related signaling pathway in a TRAF3-independent manner.",

Kurt-Jones and colleagues first demonstrated that the innate immune response to the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is mediated by TLR4 plus its cofactor CD14 on the plasma membrane, indicating that nonbacterial components can serve as extracellular PAMPs (24). Although some viral structural proteins, such as the nucleocapsid (N) from measles virus (38) and viral ribonucleoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus (39), can activate IRF3 and TBK1/IKK\u03b4, respectively, it remains to be determined how these viral products can function as PAMPs and where the driving forces for their activation come from. It has been shown that the SARS-CoV M protein alone not only can form virus-like particles (VLPs) in a viral RNA-independent manner (40) but also can induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting some key survival signal pathways, such as the Akt signaling pathway (41). Thus, the M proteins derived from these infected and apoptotic cells might be eventually secreted and released into the extracellular compartments where the TLRs (such as TLR2 and TLR4) on the cell surface can be potentially recognized and subsequently activated by these extracellular PAMPs for the induction of the IFN-I response. To clarify this possibility, we employed several approaches to test whether the driving force for M protein-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production is generated from inside or outside the cells. We used two types of inhibitors, BFA and OxPAPC, to block either the intracellular transport of M protein or the extracellular binding of M protein on TLR2 and TLR4, respectively. Our results reveal that M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction is independent of M protein secretion as well as the extracellular stimulation of TLR2/TLR4 signaling, indicating that the driving force for the M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction is likely generated from inside the cells.",

            "text": "Our results may contradict some previous reports related to M-mediated IFN-I response. Siu et al. demonstrated that the M protein of SARS-CoV negatively regulated the dsRNA-induced and signaling molecule-induced IFN-I production. They also showed that M protein alone was unable to activate the IFN-I promoter activity (34). One study even showed that M protein negatively regulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (42). A possible explanation for these discrepancies might be related to the M gene itself. Early study has shown that M protein possesses a higher substitution rate than other structural proteins in SARS-CoV, and the outcome of these substitutions alters the biochemical and immunological properties of M proteins (43, 44). One amino acid alteration from valine to alanine at residue 68 is indeed found in the M protein from the GZ50 isolate studied by Siu et al. compared with the isolate used in the current study. Our functional analysis provides strong evidence to demonstrate that the valine-to-alanine change at residue 68 of M protein is sufficient to abolish M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction at both the transient-transfection level and the viral infection level (Fig. 1D and E and 8B and C). Therefore, this amino acid substitution in M proteins indeed affects the interaction between M protein and the PRR for the subsequent IFN-I induction.",

            "text": "It still remains elusive which cytosolic PRR is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. The M protein might be a multifaceted molecule that physically interacts with diverse intracellular sensors and signaling factors (34, 42). Our data indicate that the TLR-related signaling pathway rather than the RIG-I signaling cascade is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. Interestingly, we observed consistent TRAF3 reductions in both HEK293T and J2-M\u03c6 cells as tested by the transiently intracellular overexpression of the M gene. TRAF3 is one of the key signaling molecules specifically responsible for IFN-I induction (28). Data from the work of Siu and colleagues have shown that M(V68A) excludes the TRAF3 inclusion in the TRAF3.TANK.TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex (39). Although M(V68A)-mediated TRAF3 exclusion inhibits IFN-\u03b2 induction, our study showed that M-mediated TRAF3 exclusion is independent of ligand stimulation and the disassociated TRAF3 and TBK1 could not complex with M protein, indicating that M protein might modulate the functions of TBK1 complex indirectly. Interestingly, we demonstrated that M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction was associated with the upregulation of the adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not TRIF, which are all involved in the initiating phase of TLR signaling pathways. TRIF is required for both TLR3- and TLR4-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. In the activation of TLR3, TRIF is directly recruited to the TIR domain of dimerized TLR3, while in the activation of TLR4, TRIF is recruited to dimerized TLR4 indirectly through another TIR-containing adaptor protein, TICAM2 (also called TRAM). If TRIF is not required for M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction, M-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction might be activated via a noncanonical TLR4-related signaling cascade independently of TRIF and TRAF3.",

The reaction products were probed with antibodies to p-TBK1, p-IRF3, p-NF-\u03baB p65, IFN-\u03b2, and Myc tag. The expression of \u03b2-actin served as a loading control. The relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the \u03b2-actin control. (E) Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the expression of TRAF3 in both 293 wild-type and 293 siTRAF3 stable cells. (F) M gene products were able to upregulate IFN-\u03b2 expression after stably knocking down the endogenous TRAF3 expression. Cell lysates were prepared from 293 siTRAF3 stable cells that were transiently transfected with increased doses (0, 2, and 6 \u00b5g) of pCMV-Myc-M for 48 h. The reaction products were probed with anti-IFN-\u03b2 and anti-Myc antibodies. The expression of \u03b2-actin served as an internal control. The relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the \u03b2-actin control. The result is representative of at least 2 identical experiments. (G) The M gene product may disrupt the TBK1 and TRAF3 complex formation indirectly. Plasmid pCMV-Myc-M or pCMV-Myc was cotransfected with TBK1-Flag and TRAF3-HA. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h posttransfection. Co-IP was conducted as shown in the left panel. About 10% input from each lysate preparation was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA, anti-Flag, and anti-Myc antibodies as probes. The rest of the lysate was first immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody conjugated with an affinity gel. Then, the reaction products were probed with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. A reverse co-IP experiment was also conducted as shown in the right panel. The lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Then, the reaction products were individually probed with anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and anti-HA antibodies and subsequently subjected to Western blotting. The result is representative of at least 2 identical experiments. IB, immunoblotting; ns, nonspecific. (H) The M gene product does not suppress poly(I:C)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. About 2 \u00b5g/ml of poly(I:C) was cotransfected with 2 \u00b5g of either M or M(V68A) plasmid along with pGL3-IFN-\u03b2-luciferase reporter (100 ng) plus pRL-TK (10 ng) into HEK293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, dual-luciferase assays were performed to detect IFN-\u03b2 expression (left panel). Each value represents the mean \u00b1 standard deviation from three independent tests. The statistical difference was considered to be significant at a P value of \u22640.05. The IFN-\u03b2 expression was also subjected to Western blotting (right panel). The relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the \u03b2-actin control.",

(B) Effect of SARS-CoV pseudoviruses and their M protein mutant derivative on the influence of IFN-\u03b2 expression. Plasmid S and N DNAs were cotransfected with either M mutant M(V68A) or the wild-type M into HEK293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, SARS-CoV VLPs were formed and released by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Then, the collected VLPs were incubated with equal amounts of HEK293-ACE2 cells for 4 h and changed with fresh culture medium. After 24 h, total RNAs and whole-cell lysates were isolated, harvested, and subsequently subjected to RT-PCR (RT; upper panel) and Western blotting (WB; lower panel). The relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the \u03b2-actin control. The result is representative of at least 2 identical experiments. (C) Effect of both M and M(V68A) VLPs on IFN-\u03b2 expression in HEK293-ACE2 stable cells. Real-time qRT-PCR was used to detect the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels on the samples isolated in panel B. Each value represents the mean \u00b1 standard deviation from three reactions. The result is representative of at least 2 identical experiments.",
