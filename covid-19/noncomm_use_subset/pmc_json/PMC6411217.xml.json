The territory comprises 1 main island and several small islands and has 8 municipalities. We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study in 2 municipalities, Caibiran and Kawayan, from March 2014 to June 2016. Children <5 years old were identified through household visits and were invited to participate in the study. We enrolled 2348 households with 4012 children as cohort participants. We asked the caregivers of these children to record respiratory symptoms including cough, coryza, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, chest indrawing, and fever every day. Nurses conducted biweekly household visits to check these written records. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) from children who developed fever and either cough or difficulty in breathing within 7 days from household visit onset. In addition, when children with respiratory symptoms such as cough, difficulty in breathing, or coryza visited health facilities, we collected NPSs. The health facilities were the Biliran Provincial Hospital, Naval (capital of Biliran Province), a secondary-level referral and the only hospital in Biliran Province, and rural health units of Caibiran and Kawayan, where qualified doctors provide outpatient care. The specimens were stored in a viral transport medium at 4\u00b0C and transported with an ice pack to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila for laboratory work. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the RITM (2008-05-10, 2013-2) and ethics committee of the Tohoku University School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan (2012-1-5, 2012-1-63).",

We found only 5 2nd RSV-ARI episodes in young infants (<6 months old) (see Supplementary Table 1). Although, the infection source of 31 young infants identified as a single RSV-ARI in RSV-HH1 remained unclear (Table 1). One of the objectives of this study was to define the infection source, especially in young infants. Because we conducted a household visit biweekly, we could not collect a specimen from all of ARI episodes. It was possible that other children <5 years old with ARI were a potential source of RSV infection for young infants. Therefore, we further analyzed ARI cases without samples from children <5 years old of RSV-HH1, including preceding ARI or subsequent ARI cases, by assuming that these ARI cases were probably due to RSV.",

The 95% CI for the estimated mean serial interval in this study did not cover 1 and 2 days, which were the most frequently observed serial intervals of dates of onset between confirmed RSV-ARI cases in the same household. This means that cases with a serial interval of 1 or 2 days might not have gotten the infection from the household index case and that the real source might actually be the same source as the household index case. In this study, we assumed that 2 or more RSV-ARI cases in the same household had the same source only when they had the same date of onset, although there is no consensus among researchers on this [13]. If RSV-ARI cases with a serial interval of 1 and 2 days had the same source of infection, the actual serial interval is likely to be longer. Further studies are necessary to define the serial interval that should be considered as a common source of infection [27]. In addition, a serial interval in the same household or other close contact settings tends to be shorter than that in community settings because more extensive exposure can lead to a shorter serial interval [28]. Although different RSV subgroups may show a different serial interval, we could not analyze subgroup-specific serial intervals.",

In particular, for RSV-B in Caibiran in 2015, R0 was high, and significantly large outbreaks were observed in 2015. We often see different patterns of RSV epidemics, including the total size [29]. These differences may be due to different factors such as the level of herd immunity for each RSV subgroup. Studies have also reported that the emergence of a new genotype within the same subgroup caused a larger epidemic [30]. Studies on RSV transmission dynamics are still limited, and epidemiological parameters such as serial intervals and R0 have been obtained so far from limited data. In this study, it was not possible to analyze the factors affecting RSV transmission dynamics, because we conducted the study for only 2 years in 2 geographic locations. Considering the significant variations of R0 we observed in this study, more data from different epidemics should be obtained to estimate epidemiological parameters accurately, which is necessary to establish more effective interventions, including vaccination strategies.",

We considered episodes that occurred in the same household within 10 days before and after onset of a confirmed case as possible RSV-ARI cases, which might have overestimated RSV transmission among children in the household. Second, we did not consider asymptomatic cases in our analysis. A previous study has reported that 17.3% of RSV infections are asymptomatic among children <5 years old and that these asymptomatic cases play an important role as a source of transmission [31]. Third, since we collected the data of ARI episodes and clinical specimen only from children <5 years old, we could not capture the entire picture of household RSV transmission. In total, there was no possible index case for approximately 70% (44 of 62) of the young infants with RSV. A previous study has shown that parents and school-age children also play an important role as a source of RSV infection for infants [13]. Moreover, we could estimate R0 by using the cases <5 years old. There might be a secondary case infected by children <5 years old. Therefore, R0 in our analysis might be underestimated, and further study is warranted to understand RSV transmissibility among entire population including \u22655 years old. Fourth, we did not consider RSV transmission from outside the household. For example, contact with playmates and other infants in a day care center might be an important source of infection for infants. It is possible that they acquired RSV infection outside of the household. However, we could not analyze this possibility due to the study design. More detailed epidemiological studies, including social network analysis, are required to understand the complete RSV transmission dynamics. Despite these limitations, we managed to gain insight into RSV transmission patterns in a household, especially for young infants. We also estimated epidemiological parameters, such as the serial interval and R0. We believe that accumulation of such data in different settings will help establish more effective control measures against RSV in the future.",
