SCT recipients are at higher risk of severe infections, since they often remain in a state of immunosuppression after transplantation, depending on such comorbidities as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the need for immunosuppressive drug treatment.12 In particular, SCT recipients are susceptible to common respiratory viruses (CRVs) owing to their impaired T-cell immunity.3 CRVs are common causes of both upper respiratory tract disease (URD) and lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in this population, and have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality.456 To date, there has been only a preliminary study of infections caused by CRVs among SCT recipients in Korea.78 However, the epidemiology of individual CRVs varies according to the region and the times and many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by CRVs have been achieved. The present study aimed to describe the incidence, clinical courses, and risk factors for mortality associated with LRDs caused by CRVs in SCT recipients at a single SCT center in Korea.",

The aim was to identify LRDs caused by CRVs. CRVs associated with LRDs in patients included influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1\u20133, human rhinovirus (HRhV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, coinfections, and mortality were investigated. The endpoint of the study was set as January 31, 2012, or the time of death or loss to follow up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Yeouido and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (approval nos. SC10RISI0023 and KC13RISI0364).",

Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 3 or more days after hospital admission.9 The presence of co-pathogens was defined as the isolation of pathogenic bacterial species, fungal species, or other opportunistic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), from the respiratory specimen obtained within a month of detection of a CRV, in conjunction with consistent symptoms, and as confirmed by infectious disease specialists.5 Proven or probable invasive fungal disease was defined according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group Consensus Group in 2008.11 A mixed CRV infection was defined by the isolation of more than two CRVs during the same episode. Mortality due to LRDs caused by CRVs was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure, with no period of complete recovery between the onset of illness and death within 30 days, and without a documented co-pathogen.12 Overall mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days following diagnosis of CRV-LRD. An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of <200 cells/mm3 blood within the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection diagnosis was defined as lymphopenia, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500 cells/mm3 blood within the 2 weeks prior to a CRV infection was defined as neutropenia.6 The dosage of corticosteroid use was classified into three groups according to the highest daily dose taken by the patient during the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection: high-dose corticosteroid use was defined as \u22651 mg/kg/day of prednisone and its equivalent dose of corticosteroids: low-dose use was defined as \u22641 mg/kg/day of prednisone; and the third group received topical corticosteroids.13 The grade of immunodeficiency was classified into three groups, including severe, moderate, and mild immunodeficiency.14 Severe immunodeficiency (SID) was defined as the presence of two or more of the following: allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) within 6 months, or autologous SCT (autoSCT) within 3 months, preceding the diagnosis of a CRV infection; acute GVHD (grade \u22652); ALC <200 cells/mm3 or ANC <500 cells/mm3 within 2 weeks, before the diagnosis; and a pre-engraftment period or administration of immunosuppressive therapy \u22642 weeks prior to the diagnosis. Moderate immunodeficiency (MID) was defined as the presence of only one criteria of SID or two or more of the following criteria: an alloSCT within 1 year (\u22656 months) or an autoSCT within 6 months (\u22653 months), prior to the diagnosis of a CRV infection; ALC between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, or ANC between 500 and 1000 cells/mm3, within 2 weeks before the diagnosis; and administration of immunosuppressive drugs within 1 month prior to the diagnosis. Patients who met only one criterion of MID were regarded as having a mild immunodeficiency state.",

Influenza A virus and RSV coinfection was observed in two patients. HPIV and HRhV coinfection was observed in one patient, and HPIV and RSV coinfection was also observed in one patient. The baseline characteristics of the 67 SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs are shown in Table 1. During the winter, RSV and influenza A virus were the predominant CRVs, while the proportion of HPIV infection increased through spring and summer (Fig. 1). Analysis for cumulative incidences of first CRV-LRD episodes demonstrated that the most common causative pathogen of CRV-LRDs at both 100 days [cumulative incidence estimate, 23.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.3\u201343.7] and at 1 year after SCT (cumulative incidence estimate, 69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9\u201392.5) was HPIV. The cumulative incidence estimate of RSV was 6.9% (95% CI, 0.0\u201316.1), and only two patients presented with LRDs cau-sed by influenza A virus and HRhV (one patient each) before 100 days following SCT (Fig. 2A).

The most common type and extent of radiographic infiltration of influenza-caused LRDs were alveolar pattern (64.3%) and bilateral lung field (85.7%), respectively. Seven (50%) of 14 patients with influenza-LRDs received antiviral therapy, and all received it within 48 hours following influenza-LRD diagnosis. However, early antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset was performed for only 3 (21.4%) patients. One patient received combination therapy with peramivir (600 mg/day for 8 days) and oseltamivir (300 mg/day for 15 days). Five (35.7%) patients experienced mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day overall mortality rate of these patients was 35.7% (5/14). Two patients were diagnosed with the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, of which one died due to respiratory failure on day 28 following the diagnosis. Of the 31 patients with RSV-LRDs, 41.9% (13/31) were hospital-acquired and 9.7% (3/31) received antiviral therapy. The 30-day overall mortality rate was 25.8% (8/31) for these patients. Two patients with RSV-LRDs were treated with oral ribavirin, one with aerosolized ribavirin, and all received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 1\u20131.5 g/kg for 1\u20132 days). The patient who received aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG survived, whereas the two patients treated with oral ribavirin died. Seven (36.8%) of the 19 patients with HPIV-LRDs received oral ribavirin (800 mg/day for 11\u201326 days). The 30-day overall mortality rate of patients with HPIV-LRDs was 31.6% (6/19). Four (57.1%) of seven patients with HRhV-LRDs required mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day mortality rate for these patients was 14.3% (1/7). Co-pathogens isolated from respiratory specimens were detected in 33.8% (23/67) of patients with CRV-LRDs. The most common bacterial co-pathogen was Acinetobacter baumannii (n=7; 10.4%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5; 7.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=4; 5.9%). Aspergillus species were detected in 6 patients and CMV-PCR of the BAL fluid was positive for two patients. Only 2 patients died without pneumonia being the cause of death, one due to septic shock as a result of infectious colitis and one due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.",

However, to overcome this limitation, only CRV-LRD cases were included. Due to the small number of cases, it was not possible to analyze the risk factors for mortality for individual CRV-LRDs. Another limitation was that it was difficult to determine whether the fatal outcome was solely attributable to the CRV or due to a combination of the CRV and co-pathogens. However, precise discrimination of the pathogen would likely have been meaningless, since damage to the respiratory epithelium as a result of a CRV infection may have been the key factor that facilitated the occurrence of superinfections.9 Recent studies showed that viral nucleic acid was detected in the bloodstream more frequently among SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, HAdV, and HMPV, and that this was associated with increased mortality rates.363738 Therefore, viral nucleic acid detection in the bloodstream of SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs could be used to predict disease severity, poor outcome, and the need for intensified antiviral treatment in the future.",

For SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, or HPIV infections, those receiving high-dose steroid treatment or those with lymphopenia, early antiviral treatment should be considered; especially considering the fact that no vaccine is yet available for RSV and HPIV. Furthermore, infection control measures, including hand hygiene and respiratory droplet isolation, which reduce the occurrence of new infections and transmission, are important for CRVs without a specific antiviral treatment option, such as HRhV and HMPV. Finally, in order to prevent LRDs caused by influenza, which is the only CRV with an available vaccine, the annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all SCT recipients.",
