            "text": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) involves colonization and invasion of bacteria into the tissues of the urinary tract. The infection in humans is influenced by gender and age and is common in young women (1-3). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli UPEC bacteria often originate from feces and once these microorganisms overcome the host's immune system, they are able to colonize the lower urinary tract and establish an infection (3, 4). The infection caused by UPEC is usually self-limiting and is rarely spread beyond the urethra. However, UPEC bacteria invade bladder epithelial cells by intracellular amplification, and upon exiting cell surfaces, invade other epithelial cells in the tissues of the bladder, establishing a persistent infection (2, 5). Due to urinary flow, mucus and secretory IgA secretion, and bactericidal properties of urine epithelial cells, the urinary tract is normally sterile. However, some strains of E. coli bacteria can grow in the urinary tract owing to several shared virulence factors, such as adhesion molecules and toxins (6). ",

Among them, type I and p Pili are considered the most important (9-12). It is believed that UPEC bacteria establish UTIs and the presence of PapG possibly promotes the progression of the infection to a more severe form, called pyelonephritis (4, 9). Current treatment of acute UTI is limited due to the increasing rate of antibiotic-resistant strains as well as adverse effects of vaccines (6, 13). While several vaccine candidates have been tested in clinical trials against UTI in humans, no suitable results have been obtained to date. Therefore, the design of new strategies in vaccine development can lead to an increase in vaccine efficacy (14, 15). ",

Escherichia coli type P is one of the most important agents of UTIs worldwide (9-12). According to various reports, UTI occurrence is higher in women, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients than in men (3, 10, 12). The binding process in UPEC is facilitated by type 1 and P fimbriae (2, 9). Unlike type 1 fimbria, which mainly causes infections of the lower urinary tract system, P fimbria leads to ascending infections in the urinary tract and is the basis for the severe kidney infection pyelonephritis (2, 4, 9). Numerous studies have focused on UTIs (20-22). Antibiotics are a well-known method to reduce and prevent acute urinary infections; the development of an effective vaccine against the specific infection is another possible strategy (6, 13-15). Since the binding step is very important in the colonization and infection process, the inhibition of bacterial binding would be an effective strategy; a wide variety of vaccines focus on the inhibition of bacterial binding via distinct target molecules (13-18).

Therefore, we hypothesized that the use of L. reuteri in combination with a vaccine modulates immune responses and increases vaccine potency. In fact, through stimulation of the innate immune system and Toll like receptors (17-19), L. reuteri provides a milieu in which lymphocytes are able to recognize PapG in inflammatory conditions and increase the immunogenic form (23-25). Furthermore, L. reuteri can act as an inhibitor of pathogenic bacteria isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis; therefore, it can have beneficial effects against UTIs (26).",

The Helicobacter pylori urease subunit B gene E fragment with an anchor sequence from Staphylococcus aureus (spaX) was cloned into a PAMJ399 expression vector, expressed under a p170 promoter in L. lactis, and confirmed by western blot analysis (28). This was the first report of a surface presentation system using lactic acid bacteria to provide an oral vaccine against H. pylori (28). In 2009, Jian-kui et al. presented E. coli PgsA and F41 antigens on the surface of L. casei and the antigen display was confirmed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry (15). In addition, oral administration of surface-displayed Lactobacillus to mice causes an increase in the secretory IgA titer and had a protective effect in an experimental challenge (15). In the present study, we produced L. reuteri bacteria displaying the PapG protein as a vaccine candidate for further study. We intend to evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine in a murine model to show the effect of our vaccine candidate on immunologic parameters as well as the protective effect against experimental challenges.",
