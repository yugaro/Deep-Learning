Immunopathogenesis of KD involves systemic inflammation, and activated monocytes have an important role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukins 1\u03b2 and 6 (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, respectively)91011). Activation of CD14+ monocytes initiates the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are coreceptors of CD14 expressed on monocytes12). Activation of TLRs can trigger activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), the ubiquitous transcription factor that controls production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, leading to a massive systemic immune response and causing high fever12131415). Among the TLRs, the role of TLR2 in CAL development in KD has been previously studied using a mouse model of coronary arteritis1617). By using the Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCCWE)-induced mouse model of coronary arteritis, it has been shown that via TLR2 pathway, along with myeloid differentiating factor 88, the macrophages and dendritic cells are activated by LCCWE16), resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b218).",

All enrolled patients met the following criteria for complete KD: fever and at least 4 of the following 5 clinical symptoms\u2014rash, conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the oral mucosa, and changes in the extremities; or fever and 3 of the above clinical symptoms plus coronary artery abnormalities (dilatation or aneurysm) documented by echocardiography4). Children who presented with incomplete KD were excluded from our study. To exclude other febrile illnesses resembling KD, we determined the serum titers of antistreptolysin O, anti-Epstein-Barr viral, antimumps viral, and antimycoplasma antibodies in all samples from patients with KD. Furthermore, we performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from patients with KD, for common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus). We also performed neck ultrasonography on these patients to rule out suppurative lymphadenitis. All patients received 2 g/kg IVIG in a single dose at the time of diagnosis and were treated with high doses of oral aspirin (80 mg/kg/day), until they became afebrile for 3 to 4 days, as specified in the 2004 American Heart Association guidelines4). Afterwards, they were given low doses of aspirin (5 mg/kg/day). Serial echocardiography was performed on all patients with KD at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later, to study CAL development in the acute stage of KD. Echocardiography was conducted on all patients by a single cardiologist to evaluate the presence of structural heart diseases as well as to obtain M-mode echocardiographic parameters, including left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic dimensions (LVESD), and fractional shortening (FS). We measured the internal diameter of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) to classify patients with CAL development (CAL (+)) and those who without CAL development (CAL (\u2212)). We did not include the measurements of the left main coronary arteries (LMCAs), as normal anatomic variations in LMCAs have been reported to be frequent, and the probability of isolated dilatation of LMCA without accompanying dilatation of LAD has been reported to be low22). The z scores of coronary arteries were obtained using RCA and LAD measurements as well as the nonlinear regression equations based on the body surface area (BSA)22). To calculate the z scores of RCA and LAD measurements, we derived the predicted values of RCA and LAD measurements for a patient with a given BSA using the following regression equations, reported by McCrindle et al.22):",

We found that sIL-10 before treatment in the CAL (+) group was not significantly higher than that in the CAL (\u2212) group. The reason for this finding might be that, in our study, patients belonging to the CAL (+) group were those that had developed CALs at one month after diagnosis. High sIL-10 at the acute stage of KD might have had a cumulative beneficial effect on the inflammation of the coronaries past the acute stage of KD, as IL-10 is known to have both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory properties1920).",

Additionally, our results showed that sensitivity in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD was comparable between FTLR2% before initial treatment and sIL-10. One of the numerous mechanisms of action of IVIG in KD is the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation in CD14+ macrophages and monocytes after IVIG therapy28). Because NF-\u03baB is involved in the downstream TLR signaling pathway, this may indicate that in IVIG nonresponders, the increased FTLR2% before the initial treatment would lead to increased activation of NF-\u03baB, thus requiring additional treatment with IVIG, but further studies are needed to confirm this. In addition to the known predictive markers of IVIG resistance78), monitoring FTLR2% could be useful in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD. Early identification of patients at risk of CAL development and IVIG resistance, by monitoring FTLR2%, could supplement existing guidelines for additional intensive treatment strategies, such as the early combination of corticosteroid therapy in addition to the initial IVIG treatment as proposed by Kobayashi et al.7), early in the course of KD.",

Another limitation might be the relatively short-term follow-up of our patients, as CALs can form after 1 month of onset of the disease. Additionally, as this was a prospective study, the FTLR2% and sIL-10 before the initial treatment could have affected the subsequent results of the echocardiograms taken 1 month later. Moreover, the regulation and interaction of TLRs and inflammatory cytokines occur in a complex manner12); therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate how FTLR2% and sIL-10 correlate. We did not separate monocytes from the whole blood in our study, therefore a small number of cells other than monocytes may have been analyzed. However, in accordance with the aim of this study, that is to establish FTLR2% as a potential marker of KD severity and prognosis, we thought that the use of whole blood samples served as an easier and more appropriate approach. Furthermore, the CAL (\u2212) group showed increased FTLR2% after the initial treatment compared to the CAL (+) group. We propose that, with time, other endogenous TLR2 ligands might be responsible for the delayed stimulation of TLR2, in addition to the initial stimulus responsible for the early activation12). This finding may limit the use of FTLR2% as a prognostic parameter after the initial treatment. Our study focused on the acute changes in CALs in KD at disease onset, so further long-term follow-up studies will be needed to elucidate the long-term effects of TLR2 on coronary arteries in KD. Additional investigations of ligands capable of TLR2 activation in KD would be helpful.",
