In contrast, advances in complete genome sequencing, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics represent an attractive alternative approach to identify drug targets worthy of experimental follow-up. Because of the availability of both pathogen and host\u2013genome sequences, it has become easier to identify drug targets at the genomic level for any given pathogen.16,17 In recent years, computational methods have been used widely for the identification of potential drug and vaccine targets in different pathogenic microorganisms.18\u201321 Subtractive and comparative genomics approach combined with metabolic pathway analysis was found to be an efficient way to identify the protein-set essential for the pathogen\u2019s survival but absent in the host.22 Subtraction of the host genome from essential genes of pathogens helps in searching for non-human homologous targets which ensures no interaction of drugs with human targets. On the other hand, comparative genomics method emphasizes the selection of conserved proteins amongst several species as most favorable targets.23\u201326 The use of advanced bioinformatics tools with integrated genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics may ensure the discovery of potential drug targets for most of the infectious diseases. Once the target(s) have been identified, the in silico virtual screening of different chemical databases could provide unprecedented opportunity to select and design the best possible inhibitor(s).27",

We elucidated a good number of novel targets in E. coli O157:H7 to design effective drugs against broad-spectrum pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, we provided a modeled 3D structure of DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) which was selected as the best possible target for inhibition and designing potential drugs.

In the nitrogen cycle, different reductive or oxidative reactions are utilized by prokaryotes for energy conservation.61 In case of oxygen deprived growth conditions for E. coli, anaerobic respiration nitrate is the preferred electron acceptor.62 The putative resistance protein was identified as unique protein present in phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism (KEGG Pathway: map00440). Natural products containing carbon-phosphorous bonds, so-called C-P compounds have been found in many organisms, but only protists and bacteria, mostly actinobacteria, have biosynthetic capacity. Moreover, the secB; protein-export protein secB and etpN; type 4 prepilin-like proteins leader peptide-processing enzyme, that are the parts of bacterial secretion system (KEGG Pathway: map03070), were found as unique. Many proteins implicated in efflux of different toxins and drugs; virulence and biogenesis of different organelles (pili and flagella) are secreted.63 The secB is involved in efficient export of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli.64 In PTS (KEGG Pathway: map02060), n9 proteins were found to be uniquely present. It has been known that PTS is involved in transportation of more than 20 carbohydrates in bacteria and plays a major role in phosphorylation and uptake of carbohydrates and controlling their metabolism.65,66 Flagellar FliJ protein which is part of flagellar assembly (KEGG Pathway: map02040) as well as a putative general chaperone and cytoplasmic protein67 was identified as unique in the pathogen. The bacterial flagellum extending from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior serves as both a motor organelle and a protein export/assembly apparatus.68 A total of 19 proteins were identified as unique in the pathogen-specific pathway in a two-component system (KEGG Pathway: map02020). Bacterial two-component system is required for adaptation to external stimuli and can affect changes in cellular physiology.69 A single protein was identified to be involved in biosynthesis of siderophore group non-ribosomal peptides pathway. Polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases are known to be responsible for the biosynthesis of several siderophores such as enterobactin in E. coli.70 Two proteins were detected in case of bacterial chemotaxis. In chemotaxis, bacteria sense chemical gradients in the environment and move toward favorable conditions. The pathway is arguably best characterized in the case of E. coli.71",

Forty-four proteins were identified as broad-spectrum targets (Supplementary materials). In addition, broad-spectrum proteins involved in multiple pathways would be better targets as their inhibition of activity will hamper more than one system in the pathogen.73 dnaE subunit and AckA were involved in a maximum number of pathways. AckA catalyzes the reversible reaction of formation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and ATP. Whereas dnaE participates in some critical pathways of the pathogen like purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, DNA replication, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. There is no resolved X-ray crystallography structure for both dnaE (E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand) and AckA (E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand) as we intended to do homology modeling. However, dnaE subunit (Uniprot ID: Q8X8X5) was preferred over AckA (Uniprot ID: P0A6A5) based on suitability of homology modeling and docking studies. During the BLAST search against PDB structures (threshold e-value <0.001), dnaE subunit showed 98% sequence identity with E. coli replicative dnaE subunit (PDB ID: 2HNH), whereas 94% for AckA with Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium AckA (PDB ID: 3SK3 and 3SLC) (data not shown). Furthermore, an inter-domain motion during ligand binding as well as a ligand binding pocket located at the dimeric interface of form-II AckA has been reported74 that is very hard to address through in silico docking software. In case of dnaE subunit, literature searching helped us to identify the pocket for ligand binding as well as important and conserved residues within the pocket that are important for catalytic activity.75",

The properties of the active site are determined by the sequences of amino acids and the 3D arrangement of the polypeptide chains of the enzyme. Identification of the active site of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain dnaE was done by CASTp server. This server calculates the surface area and volume of the pocket of the given structure. In addition, it also shows the active site residues. The active site residues with a volume of 17,116 were shown in Figure 6. Literature searching helped us to identify the important residues within the pocket. The structure of catalytic alpha subunit of E. coli is known to have three conserved residues of aspartate (Asp 402, Asp 404, and Asp 556 in our model, ensured by aligning with the reference structure, data not shown) and four conserved positive residues (Arg 391, Arg 397, Arg 710, and Arg 711) in this structure (Arg 390, Arg 396, Arg 709, and Arg 710 in the reference structure) that are important in catalysis83 and proposed to interact with the negatively charged triphosphate tail of the incoming nucleotide respectively. Moreover, two aromatic residues, Tyr 754 and Phe 756, that could potentially interact with the nascent base pair resembles Tyr 755 and Phe 757 in our modeled structure. These residues were therefore considered as important in inhibition of DNA binding and catalysis of the dnaE subunit.",

            "text": "Twenty-four ligand molecules of E. coli K-12 obtained from BindingDB database were docked on the receptor. Molecules showing lowest binding energy were listed in Table 2. The 251D molecule is a potent inhibitor of the bacterial replicative dnaE.84 Information on these molecules\u2019 binding interaction was taken as reference to predict convenient inhibitors of dnaE of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand from the molecules of DrugBank (Figure 7A). The top 100 hits from DrugBank showing lower binding energies after being docked five times were filtered for Lipinski\u2019s rule of five85 that reduced the compounds to 59. To avoid off target binding, the compounds having human targets were excluded. The top two hits showed stable or nearly stable binding energy and good clustering performances from the docking results (Table 3) and structures are shown in Figure 8. Among the final high affinity binding molecules, DB04118 (N-coeleneterazine) and DB04698 (N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfonamide) were found to interact with important residues (Figure 7B) required for DNA binding and catalysis. According to DrugBank database, both molecules are experimental drugs. DB04118 has no specific target yet. However, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase of Helicobacter pylori (American Type Culture Collection strain 700392/26695), that catalyzes a trans-dehydration via an enolate intermediate, is the target for DB04698. These molecules could be proposed as potential inhibitors of the E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strand dnaE. For the identification of potential drug candidates human intestinal absorption is imperative.86 By using PreADMET we found human intestinal absorption was 95.36% and 88.10% for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively, indicating well-absorbed compounds (70%~100% according to PreADMET) that is desirable for drug candidates. As only the unbound drug is necessary for diffusion or transport across the cell membranes and target-drug interaction, we predicted percent drug bound in plasma protein. Plasma protein binding prediction results showed 99.28% and 100.00% plasma protein binding for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively, indicating strongly bound chemicals which are not desirable. Caco-2 cell model serves as a reliable in vitro model for the prediction of oral drug absorption. PreADMET predicted 17.45 (nm/second) and 0.36 (nm/second) Caco-2 cell permeability for DB04118 and DB04698 respectively that are considered middle and low permeability respectively. Both drugs exhibit good oral bioavailability and mostly negative result in Ames test as predicted by FAF-Drugs2 and PreADMET toxicity prediction (data not shown) and no evidence of carcinogenic activity for only DB04698 as predicted by PreADMET rodent carcinogenicity prediction. We also analyzed other ADMET properties like blood\u2013brain barrier penetration, skin permeability, MDCK cell, and P-gp inhibition, and in all of these cases results are positive for our proposed compounds (data not shown).",
