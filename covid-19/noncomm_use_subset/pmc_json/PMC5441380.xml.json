Often, they escape their natural wildlife reservoirs and infect captive or domestic animals and humans upon cross-species transmission. While the majority of zoonotic pathogens spread limitedly among humans, occasionally some do evolve the ability to efficiently transmit [5]. These may cause devastating epidemics, if not pandemics, and may establish as novel human pathogens. Emerging infectious diseases of animals likewise have typically the ability to cross species barriers and invade new host species. In contrast, introduction of pathogens into new geographical areas and climate change play an essential role in the emergence of plant diseases, and the hybridization of plant pathogens that are not naturally sympatric is repeatedly reported to be involved in plant disease emergence events [2]. The consequences of emerging pathogens in newly infected species, be it wild or domestic, or in new geographical areas, can have dire repercussions on human welfare, for example, through the disruption of ecosystem services or from large agricultural economic losses [2], [6]. As such, emerging infectious diseases are One Health threats to the global community.",

With an incubation time of 2\u20138 days, H7N9 virus infection can progress from initial symptoms of high fever and other influenza-like signs to more severe lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory distress and associated complications [8]. Exposure to infected poultry is considered the primary risk factor for human infection. A total of 556 outbreaks have been reported in domestic poultry, including chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and pheasants, largely concurrently to zoonotic cases of infection (Table 1). A few cases were reported in wild bird species. Because of their low pathogenic nature, H7N9 viruses typically cause asymptomatic or mild infections in birds.",

This ability is associated with one or two specific amino-acids in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Because seasonal influenza viruses and LPAIV H7N9 peak coincidentally during the winter months, they may co-infect an individual and subsequently reassort [11]. This may give rise to a transmissible variant, against which the human population has little pre-existing immunity, and may be at the origin of a new influenza pandemic. Strict monitoring and isolation measures are therefore essential to limit the risk of seasonal influenza and reassortment in individuals with zoonotic H7N9 virus infection.",

The presence of a diverse array of reassortants in wild bird populations worldwide also indicates a major change in the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in their bird reservoirs. Before the emergence of HPAIV H5N1, HPAIVs were thought to only evolve and spread in poultry populations, where containment and stamping-out measures contributed to their eradication. The reassortant HPAIVs of the H5 subtype represent unprecedented threats to the poultry industry. As did HPAIV H5N1, they have the potential to widely spread, if not establish, in poultry populations. Wild bird populations may represent a direct source of infection for poultry, calling for strict biosecurity measures.",

Since then, it has caused 1138 reported cases of zoonotic infection (Table 4), with a case-fatality rate of about one-third. Infection is characterized in severe cases by symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory distress, as well as renal failure [20]. MERS-CoV most likely originates from bat species, in which closely related viruses have been detected, causing chiefly asymptomatic infection [21], [22]. Dromedary camels, which develop mild respiratory tract infection with MERS-CoV, are increasingly recognized as the main proximate source of zoonotic infections [23], [24]. Contact with infected dromedary camels is considered the primary risk of infection in humans, while human-to-human transmission remains rare. Nonetheless, secondary cases of MERS are increasingly reported, mainly in hospitalized settings, often with mild or no signs and symptoms.",

These are of paramount importance for the rapid diagnosis and containment of infected individuals. While the epidemiological situation has remained largely unchanged since the emergence of MERS, large outbreaks of nosocomial infections are worrisome. These call for the development of specific intervention strategies, should the virus become efficiently transmissible among humans. Prevention at the source, for example through the vaccination of dromedary camels against MERS-CoV, is essential to limit cross-species transmission of the virus from animals to humans. However, the development of specific intervention strategies to be rapidly deployed in humans is urgently needed, and should be undertaken ahead of a potential change in the ability of MERS-CoV to transmit among humans. This may necessitate profound changes in the interactions between the public and private sectors for the development of new medicines, as was recently learned upon emergence of the Ebola virus [26].",

Until 2013, they caused isolated and largely self-limiting outbreaks in humans, of up to several hundred fatal cases each. The case-fatality rate of Ebola virus infections generally ranges from 50% to 90%, depending among other factors on the virus strain involved. Bats are believed to be the natural host reservoirs of Ebola and other filoviruses, and remain largely asymptomatic upon infection [28]. The viruses may spill over to other animal species, which may demonstrate high mortality rates upon infection. Infected animals that are hunted for bushmeat are considered the most likely source of zoonotic Ebola virus infections in humans. Yet, onward human-to-human transmission, via close contact with bodily fluids, contributes to the virus' further spread.",

The devastating nature of the infection resulted in the rapid implementation of precautionary measures at the local level, thereby interrupting chains of human-to-human transmission after initial zoonotic events [29]. The reasons why this apparently failed to control the recent Ebola epidemic are unclear. However, its emergence in more uniformly and densely inhabited West African regions, poverty, larger scale movement and travel, as well as distrusting societal and behavioral responses to public health measures, are likely to have contributed to the escape of the virus into wider geographical areas, and to its associated exponential growth phase [30]. No specific medical interventions, including the use of antiviral drugs, antibodies or vaccines, were available at the time of the crisis, in spite of promising data indicating avenues for their development. One of the reasons behind the absence of specific medical interventions is related to \u201cthe industry paradox\u201d based on a generally perceived absence of return on investment [26]. However, the scale of the epidemic, a trend towards fast-track registration for medicines against emerging pathogens, and the advent of public\u2013private-partnerships, open prospects for the private sector to invest ahead of crises, with benefits for the entire society.",
