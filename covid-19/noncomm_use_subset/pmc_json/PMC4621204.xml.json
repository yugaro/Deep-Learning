The AECOPD is defined as an acute event characterized by a worsening of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, sputum purulence, or sputum volume) that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, and leads to a change in medication.7 Patients with an established history of COPD were recruited, with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <70% at diagnosis. Standardized pulmonary function test was performed with a dry spirometer device (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) at 15 minutes after inhaling salbutamol 400 \u00b5g (Ventolin, GlaxoS-mithKline, London, UK), and the FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC ratio were recorded. In addition, the patients should be able to understand and complete the CAT independently. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with a primary diagnosis of asthma, bronchiectasis or other active chronic respiratory disease requiring treatments, interventions or diagnostics, or any other severe or uncontrolled co-morbidities; patients with mental disorders or any other condition associated with an immuno-inflammatory response; and patients who had received antibiotic or corticosteroids during the past 4 weeks.

Gram-staining of sputum was evaluated by technicians and microbiologists. Secretions containing epithelium from the deeper parts of the airways by microscopic evaluation were considered sufficient materials. Bacteria in association with such epithelium were considered as being possible pathogens. Cultures of these diluted samples were made on blood agar and chocolate agar. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an incubator in the atmosphere of 10% CO2. After overnight incubation, the plates were studied by standard techniques and all pathogenic organisms were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity (Micro Scan Walk Away 96, West Sacramento, CA, USA).",

Our detection rates of respiratory viruses were in line with recent reports, but two to three times higher than that using the conventional viral culture methods.16,17 The discrepancy could be explained by the use of Luminex multiplex PCR technique since this examining system allows the inclusion of new viruses such as human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in the more recent studies. Our study found that influenza virus is the most common virus associated with AECOPD, consistent with our results, a study from Hong Kong has shown influenza to be the most detected virus in exacerbations of COPD,18 which supports our results that influenza virus might be the most causative agent in the exacerbations of COPD in Asia. However, picornavirus was the most common one in studies from Western countries.16 This disparity in distribution of virus could be related to the geographical variation or different strains circulating at that particular year and time. Alternatively, the wider coverage of influenza vaccination in Western countries compared to Asia may also contribute to the difference of virus seen in the study.19,20 Interestingly, our study also detected five patients infected with human metapneumovirus and six patients with bocavirus in AECOPD for the first time, which provides a new insight into understanding of etiological agents in AECOPD. Further studies are needed to explore these less well-studied etiological pathogens for AECOPD. Potential bacterium was detected in 21% of acute exacerbation events, demonstrating the predominance of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and Klebsiella.",

LOS has been widely used to measure the acute impact on patients with AECOPD.23 Our results showed the longest LOS for coinfection group and shortest LOS for the non-infectious group, which was consistent with previously reports.8,24 Wilkinson et al25 had demonstrated that exacerbation symptoms and FEV1 decline were more severe in the presence of bacteria and colds (as a surrogate of viral infection) than with a cold or bacterial pathogen alone. Exacerbations associated with human rhinovirus and Haemophilus influenzae coinfection exhibited a greater bacterial load and inflammation than those with no infection or viral or bacterial infection alone. These results showed that viral and bacterial coinfection would lead to a more severe symptom and longer LOS for patients to recover, which inversely increases chances of nosocomial infection, and also social and economic burden dramatically. Therefore, we may conclude that the different infectious phenotypes are closely associated with different LOS and health status in AECOPD patients. It is worth mentioning that some researches have found that cardiovascular events, pulmonary embolism, and blood stream infections may also contribute to the prolonged stay in patients with COPD.9,26 However, we did not check all of the relevant factors or diseases associated with prolonged stay in hospital which may have an impact on our results. We will take it into consideration in future study.",
