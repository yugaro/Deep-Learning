The clinical significance of asymptomatic HHV-6 viremia remains controversial; however, HHV-6 reactivation has been independently associated with graft failure after UCBT [25]. We did not find a significant relationship between HHV-6 and graft failure in our patients. With the onset of viremia, patients were treated with foscarnet, and this may have blocked the development of end-organ disease due to HHV-6. Human herpesvirus 6 was responsible for the death of 1 patient, who developed limbic encephalitis more than 100 days after UCBT; this patient had been previously treated with foscarnet for 2 episodes of HHV-6 viremia, 1 of which was accompanied by pneumonitis.

Acyclovir resistance was confirmed in 1 patient who died of disseminated HSV-1 infection. Acyclovir resistance appears to be more common after HCT, particularly in the setting of T-cell depletion, and may be related to prolonged use of acyclovir for prophylaxis [27, 28].

Cytomegalovirus and HHV-6 were common after UCBT, but they were not associated with increased mortality. Delayed neutrophil engraftment increases the risk for bacterial and fungal infections early after UCBT and is associated with increased mortality. Multiple concurrent infections were present in more than one third of episodes, and diagnosis of one infection should not prohibit further testing for other possible infections.",
