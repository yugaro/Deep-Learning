Severe HTG poses an increased risk for the development of several conditions (e.g., pancreatitis, insulin resistance). Recent studies in humans suggest IH to be associated with low\u2010grade inflammation involved in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with IH. The risk of such complications decreases with medical control of IH. Given that biomarkers of inflammation have not been investigated in MS with IH, the aims of the study were to evaluate serum calprotectin and S100A12 concentrations (i) in healthy MS and in MS with IH, and (ii) in MS with IH in response to dietary intervention for the management of IH.",

Initially, MLo, placebo and prucalopride (1 mg/kg as a positive control) were administered orally in a cross\u2010over design. Subsequently, MMe and MHi were administered and compared to a second and third placebo treatment. This approach was chosen to enable interim analysis of data, as ethical approval only allowed to progress to a higher mirtazapine dose if no effect was seen with the lower one. On day 4 of each treatment, a test meal consisting of each dog's half daily calorie requirement and 150 mg 13C\u2010sodium acetate was fed after an overnight fast and a 13C\u2010SABT was performed.

G50% was calculated for each treatment based on cumulative non\u2010linear curve fitting of the DOB values.

A cohort of 12 German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) and 20 non\u2010GSDs diagnosed with lympho\u2010plasmacytic IBD on the basis of clinical signs, intestinal histopathology, and exclusion of other known causes of chronic gastro\u2010intestinal signs was enrolled. E. coli was cultured from endoscopically collected biopsies using MacConkey and Sheep Blood agar, and identified using API20E (BioM\u00e9rieux). Statistical analysis was performed using univariate linear mixed effect models and Fisher's exact tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The following dependent variables were considered: (i) clinical activity of disease (CCECAI; Allenspach K 2007), (ii) histological severity score (WSAVA index; Day M 2008)), (iii) use of immunosuppressive agents, and (iv) euthanasia due to intractable IBD or survival within 1 year after diagnosis. Results revealed that none of the tested virulence factors were significantly associated with the CCECAI index. However, one virulence factor from group 1 [colV:colicin V, antimicrobial peptide; P = 0.03) had a significant effect on the WSAVA index. Two of the virulence genes typically associated with ExPEC (Group 2: ompTP: inactivates antimicrobials, and cvaC: secreted toxin resulting in cytolysis) were significantly associated with euthanasia due to intractable IBD (ompTP: OR: 19, cvaC: OR: 30, P = 0.05), as well as an increased likelihood of having been treated with immunosuppressives (P = 0.03). These data are reminiscent of reports on human ulcerative colitis cases harboring mucosal E. coli with multiple ExPEC virulence factors that were associated with clinical severity. Similarly, our data indicate that specific microbial factors may be important determinants and predictors of disease progression and survival in a sub\u2010group of dogs with IBD.",

            "text": "Colonic perforation is a known complication of ileocolonoscopy in human medicine. Most perforations are immediately detected during endoscopy; however, up to 40% are diagnosed 24 h post\u2010procedure. Recent veterinary studies documented that obtaining ileal biopsies can increase the diagnostic yield of gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy for workup of diffuse intestinal diseases; therefore, this procedure is being conducted more frequently. Currently, there are no published cases in the veterinary literature documenting iatrogenic ileocecocolic [ICC] perforations or delayed diagnosis of endoscopic perforations. The purpose of the study was to identify iatrogenic ICC perforations in dogs and cats associated with lower gastrointestinal [LGI] endoscopy, including anatomical location of perforation, timing of diagnosis, risk factors and outcome. Canine and feline medical records from two university veterinary hospitals between 2012 and 2017 were retrospectively evaluated for cases with iatrogenic ICC perforation associated with diagnostic LGI endoscopy. Cases were included if full medical records, including histopathological reports, were available. Five ICC perforations associated with canine LGI endoscopy were identified; no feline endoscopic perforations were documented. All perforations occurred adjacent to the ICC valve; two were ileal and three colonic. Three perforations were immediately identified by visualization of abdominal contents during endoscopy, and one perforation was suspected intra\u2010procedure due to excessive abdominal distension and confirmed with demonstration of pneumoperitoneum on plain radiographs. Pneumoperitoneum was detected on abdominal ultrasound and radiographs in one dog 5 days post\u2010endoscopy, following evaluation for lethargy and anorexia post procedure. All dogs underwent immediate surgical correction following diagnosis of perforation, with four patients surviving beyond discharge. Histopathology from the area of perforation revealed no significant underlying pathology. The patient with delayed diagnosis of perforation died as a consequence of complications from septic peritonitis following two surgical procedures. Patient signalment, adequacy of colonic preparation and visualization, method of ileal intubation (direct intubation vs. scope advancement over biopsy forceps) and underlying GI pathology did not appear to contribute to risk of iatrogenic perforation. Recent publications suggest that ileal biopsies should be obtained in all patients undergoing diagnostic LGI endoscopy; however, clinicians should be aware that iatrogenic ICC perforation can occur in canine patients with minimal underlying GI pathology. Delayed diagnosis of ICC perforation was associated with a negative outcome; if patients become unwell within the days immediately following endoscopy, perforation should be rapidly excluded with abdominal radiography to screen for pneumoperitoneum.",

However, echocardiography may not always be available and, therefore, there is interest in identification of a VHS cutoff that predicts EPIC echocardiography inclusion criteria (EPIC\u2010ECHO+) in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Medical records from 8 sites were searched for MMVD cases that had contemporaneous thoracic radiographic and echocardiographic studies. A total of 247 cases were identified and descriptive statistics are reported as mean, median, and interquartile range for VHS (11.4, 11.2, 10.8\u201311.9), LVIDDN (1.80, 1.79, 1.58\u20132.05), and LA:Ao (1.78, 1.69, 1.42\u20132.06). Dogs that were EPIC\u2010ECHO+ (N = 126) were identified and compared to the remaining population (N = 121). Receiver operator curves were constructed for VHS and performance was explored for optimal cutoffs. The percent correct, sensitivity, specificity, false positive and negative rates for a VHS of 11.1(72%, 0.730, 0.707, 12%, 16%), 11.7(60%, 0.439, 0.85, 6%, 34%) and 11.9(58%, 0.365, 0.90, 4%, 38%) were determined. Based on these data, dogs with MMVD and a VHS >11.7 have a high likelihood of meeting EPIC\u2010ECHO+ (85% specificity) and an acceptable false positive rate (6%), however approximately 34% dogs with a VHS between 10.6\u201311.7 may meet EPIC\u2010ECHO+ and warrant further echocardiographic evaluation. These results may help veterinarians apply the results of the EPIC Trial to dogs with preclinical MMVD when an echocardiogram is not readily available.",

Because of breed predisposition of this type of arrhythmia, genetic background is strongly suspected in the dog. Recently, we diagnosed the disease in several Labradors including a family with three consecutive generations. The aim of our study was to describe the inheritance pattern and to identify potentially causative gene mutations in our population. Study population consisted of 12 Labradors. Eight dog was diagnosed with different severity of the disease, one was a 13 years old healthy littermate in an affected family, three dogs (>10 years old) from different breed lines served as controls. Clinical diagnosis was made by electrocardiography and echocardiography. Inheritance pattern was studied by pedigree analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA\u2010anticoagulated blood samples using a commercial kit. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of healthy and diseased littermates was used to identify candidate mutations (Illumina HiSeq2500 next generation sequencing system, Agilent Sure Select Canine All Exon 54 Mb library\u2010kit, 50x\u2010coverage, CanFam3.1 annotation). Selection of target mutations in genes related to calcium transport was based on clinical experience with calcium channel blocker diltiazem, that could effectively control the disease. Sanger\u2010sequencing was used to validate WES results in the study population and in controls (ABI3500 capillary\u2010sequencing system, BigDye3.1 chemistry). The disease was present in all generations (affecting both genders) of the affected Labrador family, although the symptoms varied among the individuals. Sudden death at young age occurred in the offsprings of parents that were both clinically affected. Development of congestive heart failure between 5 and 8 years of age due to tachycardiomyopathy was another observed phenotype, while there were also some clinically asymptomatic dogs with or without the arrhythmia. Comparison of the WES data of the healthy and diseased littermates resulted in 1629 differences in coding regions. After filtering for calcium turnover related targets a homozygous single nucleotide variant (c.[3019C>A]; [Gln1007Lys]) in Ryanodine receptor\u20102 (RyR2) gene and a heterozygous insertion (c.246_247insCAG; p.Gln92_Ser93insGln) in the calcium activated potassium channel gene (KCNN2) were identified. Both were confirmed to be present in all of the clinically affected (related and unrelated) dogs and absent in healthy controls by Sanger\u2010sequencing. Pedigree analysis suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with strong but incomplete penetrance and variable expression in the affected Labrador family. The identified RyR2 and KCNN2 mutations may have a causative role in the disease development in Labrador retrievers.",

            "text": "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is a clinical syndrome caused by systemic inflammation of infectious or non\u2010infectious origin. SIRS is characterized by an endogenous cascade of interleukins and other inflammatory mediators such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106 and IL\u20101 which are responsible for myocardial depression during systemic inflammation. Conventional echocardiographic indices of left ventricular systolic function such as fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) are not sensitive enough to detect mild or early systolic dysfunction in dogs suffering from SIRS. Two\u2010dimensional Speckle\u2010Tracking Echocardiography (2D\u2010STE) is a new echocardiographic technique that allows an objective and quantitative evaluation of global and regional myocardial function through the analysis of the motion of speckles that are created by the interaction of ultrasonic beams and the myocardium during the 2\u2010dimensional examination. We tested the hypothesis that 2D\u2010STE may detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction, not diagnosed by conventional echocardiography, in dogs with SIRS. Seventeen dogs with evidence of SIRS and 17 healthy dogs as a control group were included in this prospective study. All the procedures were performed for diagnostic purpose; the control group was composed of healthy dogs undergoing surgical castration or ovariohysterectomy. We excluded from the study breeds predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, pregnant females, dogs treated with opioids, sedatives or anesthetic drugs during the 12 h before echocardiography. We also excluded dogs with previous diagnosis of, or echocardiographic evidence of congenital or acquired cardiac disease and dogs with an arrhythmia. At the time of Hospital admission each dog was submitted to standard 2D, M\u2010mode, Doppler and 2D\u2010STE with simultaneous ECG and blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, blood samples were obtained for CBC, biochemical profile and the measurements of cTnI and CRP serum levels. The results showed that the standard echocardiographic indices of systolic function such as EF, FS were not significantly different between the two groups. On the contrary, the Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Peak Strain of endomyocardial layer and the STE\u2010derived Ejection Fraction (STE\u2010EF) were significantly lower in the SIRS group than in the control group. We did not find significant correlation between CRP serum levels and 2D\u2010STE variables and between cTnI and STE variables. Furthermore we did not find a significant difference in cTnI serum levels between the two groups. Our study demonstrated that 2D\u2010STE was more sensitive than standard echocardiography in detecting early or mild to moderate myocardial dysfunction, not detected by conventional echocardiography, in a population of dogs with SIRS.",

To expand this treatment to treat canine dilated cardiomyopathy requires the creation of cryopreserved allogeneic cell banks since this allows timely access to large cell numbers and avoids obtaining diseased autologous myocardial tissue from potentially unstable dogs.

We evaluated the prognostic usefulness of clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic findings in dogs with CT. Data were collected retrospectively from 108 dogs with CT undergoing pericardiocentesis (PC) from 2006 to 2011. Dogs alive at 30 days following the first PC were defined as short\u2010term survivors. Longer\u2010term MST was determined from the medical records, and from follow\u2010up telephone interviews. The prevalence of CT was one of 265 presented dogs (0.004%). The overall long\u2010term MST was 44 days (range 0.5\u20131455). Dogs with a sonographically demonstrated cardiac mass had a shorter MST compared to others (19 vs. 90 days, P = 0.005). Males were significantly over\u2010represented. Golden retriever dogs were over\u2010represented and had a higher occurrence of idiopathic CT. Mixed breed dogs were under\u2010represented. PC at the Cardiology Service, ascites upon presentation, an idiopathic CT, and pericardiectomy, were associated with a higher, while pallor and an inability to ambulate upon presentation were associated with a lower 30\u2010day survival rate. Survival rates did not differ between dogs undergoing PC from the right or the left hemithorax. Survival rates did not differ between dogs undergoing a single and those undergoing several PCs. However, median time\u2010intervals from the first\u2010to\u2010second and from the second\u2010to\u2010third PCs were significantly longer in survivors compared to non\u2010survivors (35 vs. 9, P = 0.001, and 21 vs. 5 days, P = 0.04, respectively). Two dogs died prior to PC completion. Seven dogs had an underlying myxomatous mitral valve disease. Four of these were Dachshunds, of which three had a left atrial\u2010wall rupture leading to an acute, hemorrhagic CT. In the remaining three, the pericardial effusate was a modified transudate. In 31 dogs the drained effusate volume in the first PC significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) with the pre\u2010PC sonographic apex\u2010to\u2010pericardial distance. There was no association between apex\u2010to\u2010pericardial distance (P = 0.086) or volume of fluid drained during PC (P = 0.5) with the 30\u2010day survival. Generally, dogs presenting with CT have a poor long\u2010term prognosis. However, Golden retrievers, dogs selected for surgical pericardiectomy, those that present with ascites, without pallor, and are ambulatory and those with longer inter\u2010pericardiocentesis intervals have higher survival rates. Survival rate is not affected by the side of hemithorax from which pericardiocentesis is performed.",

A retrospective review of digitally stored ECGs and associated medical records of dogs with a recorded ECG as part of routine clinical evaluation was performed. Medical records were reviewed for signalment and cardiac disease diagnosis in dogs with notched QRS complexes identified. The age at time of ECG recording was 9.15 +/\u2010 3.38 years for the 85 dogs with notched QRS complexes in at least 1 ECG lead. Most dogs (78.8%) had 3 or less ECG leads with notched QRS complexes. Most dogs (69.4%) with notched QRS complexes in at least 1 lead had cardiac disease. The odds ratio of a dog having cardiac disease if more than 1 lead was identified with notched QRS complexes was 3.97. The most common cardiac disease identified was chronic atrioventricular valvular degeneration (CVD), and the majority of these dogs (80%) had 2 or less leads with notched QRS complexes. In conclusion dogs with and without cardiac disease can have notched QRS complexes, and the likelihood of a dog having cardiac disease that has more than 1 ECG lead with notched QRS complexes is significant which should warrant diagnostic evaluation.",

This study aim to detect and quantify plasma metabolites during a feed challenge\u2010test in dogs and to identify alterations in the metabolism related to overweight. Twenty\u2010eight healthy intact male Labrador retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4\u20135 on a 9\u2010point scale) and 16 as overweight (BCS 6\u20138). After overnight fasting, plasma samples were collected and dogs were fed a high\u2010fat meal. Postprandial plasma samples were collected hourly for 4 h. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was conducted and 41 plasma metabolites were statistically evaluated. The results showed that all postprandial time points differed from the fasting time point in multivariate discriminant analysis (cross\u2010validated ANOVA: P = 0.00014). Eleven specific metabolites with peak concentrations mainly at 2 or 3 h postprandially contributed to the separations. Carnitine was identified as a metabolite related to overweight at all time points in stepwise logistic regression analysis (P = 0.03) and overweight dogs had lower carnitine response in a mixed model repeated measures analysis (P = 0.005). Notably, the fasting carnitine concentration in overweight dogs (mean \u00b1 SD, 9.4 \u00b1 4.2 mM) was very close to a proposed reference limit for carnitine deficiency. These findings demonstrate that NMR is suitable for metabolic evaluations in feed\u2010challenges in dogs. The lowered carnitine concentration in overweight dogs warrants further investigation as it could indicate carnitine deficiency and an altered lipid metabolism in overweight dogs.",

At present, medical management of canine PDH consists of either trilostane or mitotane therapy. Both treatments have disadvantages associated with the induction of hypoadrenocorticism. Therefore, a more specific inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis is desirable. Our recent studies indicate that the steroidogenic enzyme cytochrome P\u2010450c17 (CYP17) could be an interesting target for selective inhibition of cortisol production without impeding the synthesis of aldosterone. Abiraterone acetate (AA), a highly selective irreversible CYP17\u2010inhibitor, is already available on the market and successfully used for the treatment of castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer in humans. In addition, the registration for human application will probably enable a relatively straightforward implementation into veterinary clinical practice.

Mann Whitney test was used to compare groups and Spearman rank correlation coefficient to assess correlation between endogenous insulin and IGF\u20101; P < 0.05 was considered significant. Serial blood samples of 219 cats were recruited (two samples: 103 cats; three: 55; four: 44; \u2265 five: 17). Sixty\u2010two (28.3 %) cats had at least one IGF\u20101 measurement >1000 ng/mL (median 1576 ng/mL, range 1001\u2013>2000); a median of 0.6 units/kg/injection insulin (range 0\u20132.4) was administered. Of the cats with IGF\u20101 >1000 ng/mL, 20 (9.1 %) initially showed IGF\u20101 <1000 ng/mL; therefore, the attending clinician could have discarded the possibility of HS in these patients. Median subsequent IGF\u20101 increase was 594 ng/mL (range 71\u20131495), having initially received a median of 73 days of insulin treatment (range 25\u2013154). Basal endogenous insulin in untreated diabetic cats with IGF\u20101 <1000 ng/mL (n = 106; median 29.0 ng/L, range 9.2\u2013791) was significantly lower than in those with IGF\u20101 >1000 ng/mL (n = 15; median 64.2 ng/L, range 9.2\u2013490; P = 0.024). A moderate positive correlation (rs = 0.42, P < 0.0001) was detected between endogenous insulin and IGF\u20101 in untreated cats. In this study, approximately 1 in 10 newly diagnosed diabetic cats with an IGF\u20101 suggestive of underlying HS, based on the currently advocated cut\u2010off, will initially show a negative value using this cut\u2010off.

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism relies upon measurement of basal plasma concentrations of total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). A low plasma T4 combined with a high plasma TSH points to primary hypothyroidism. However, 30\u201338% of hypothyroid dogs have TSH values within the reference range. Consequently, a low plasma total T4 concentration in combination with a plasma TSH concentration within the reference range does not distinguish between dogs with hypothyroidism and dogs with non\u2010thyroidal illness (NTI). A potential interesting observation from previous studies (Lee et al; 2001, and Diaz\u2010Espi\u00f1eira et al; 2008) is that hypothyroidism in dogs is associated with increased release of growth hormone (GH).",

Viscoelastic testing has been proven to be influenced by anemia, and might not reliably assess hemostasis in IMHA patients. Calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) is a thrombin generation (TG) assay that has been validated in clinically healthy dogs. The objective of the study was to assess the suitability of TG in the assessment of hypercoagulability in IMHA patients. IMHA was determined by the presence of anemia, spherocyte and positive slide agglutination test or positive Coomb's Test. CBC, coagulation profile and CAT parameters (lag time, time to peak, peak, endogenous thrombin potential) were performed in all IMHA patients, at the time of diagnosis and then at 48 and 96 h. Lag time was prolonged for IMHA patients at day 0 (D0) and D2; and time to peak was higher on D0 but not statistically different on D2 or D4 compared to healthy dogs. Peak was higher in dogs with IMHA at D0, D2 and D4. There was no statistical difference in the endogenous thrombin potential between IMHA and healthy dogs. No correlation between the CAT parameters and blood cell count, coagulation parameters or the likelihood for the patient to be discharged. Prolonged lag time and time to peak indicate hypocoagulation in IMHA dogs early in the disease onset, however, based on peak value, IMHA patients appear to generate more thrombin once coagulation is initiated compared to normal dogs. TG was not useful in predicting patient outcomes.",

This study aimed to describe mortality associated with in\u2010hospital CPA, determine median survival time of dogs and cats that survive CPA, and examine the incidence and persistence of acquired neurological deficits. Medical records of animals that underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at a referral centre were reviewed. Factors examined included species and age, managing department, location in hospital of arrest, primary disease process, closed versus open CPR, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), time to death, and cause of death. Where survivors to discharge were identified, the animal's primary care veterinarian was contacted for provision of medical records following discharge. A total of 241 animals underwent CPR (196 dogs and 45 cats) with 116 (48%) animals achieving ROSC and 29 of 41 (12%) surviving to discharge. Complete medical records were obtained for 79% (23/29) of survivors. Five of 29 (17%) had neurological deficits including depressed mentation, ataxia, circling and blindness on leaving hospital. All had either complete resolution or significant improvement of neurologic deficits within one month. Eight animals (35%) died following discharge prior to completion of the study period, however two were excluded from analysis as they were discharged explicitly for a palliative visit. The remaining six animals had a median survival time of 1284 days (502\u20131508 days). Fifteen animals (65%) were alive on completion of the study, with a median of 1362 days following discharge (162\u20132901). The proportion of animals surviving to discharge was similar to that reported in the veterinary literature. Whilst the immediate prognosis for animals undergoing CPA is poor, for animals surviving to discharge life expectancy is reasonable and the prognosis good for improvement of acquired neurological deficits.",

Computed tomographic and histopathological findings of CIPF share characteristics of both human usual intestinal pneumonia (UIP) (typical pattern of IPF in humans) and non\u2010specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) patterns. In humans, a NSIP pattern is commonly observed in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This inflammatory pulmonary syndrome results from sensitization to inhaled antigens such as fungal particles and can cause irreversible lung fibrosis in chronic stages. Given that no etiologies have been identified for CIPF, the objective of this study was to investigate a potential fungal cause. A conventional pan\u2010fungal PCR assay targeting the conserved rDNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungi, using two primer pairs (ITS1\u2010ITS2, ITS1\u2010ITS4) was performed using DNA extracted from lung tissue samples from WHWTs affected with CIPF (n = 26) and age\u2010matched unaffected controls (n = 14). DNA of soil Aspergillus fumigatus isolates were included as positive controls. Water samples were tested as negative controls. Additionally, serum samples from 8 WHWTs affected with CIPF and 8 age\u2010matched unaffected WHWTs were tested for precipitins against 10 species of environmental fungus using electrosyneresis on cellulose acetate. Fungal ITS1\u2010ITS2 and ITS1\u2010ITS4 sequences were not amplified from any lung sample, suggesting that invasive fungal infection or heavy colonization is unlikely in CIPF. On the other hand, results of the serological assay revealed the presence of \u2265 2 arcs of precipitins (indicative of a positive result) in 55 of the 160 reactions tested (35 positive results in CIPF population vs. 20 in controls, P = 0.013), supporting an increased prevalence of environmental fungal exposure in CIPF dogs compared with controls. For Lichtheimia corymbifera, a commonly involved antigen in human farmer's lung hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the number of precipitin arcs was significantly higher in CIPF dogs in comparison with controls (P = 0.04). Whether this finding reflects a lung sensitization to fungal allergens and is involved in the pathogenesis of CIPF warrants further investigation.",

Inter\u2010 and intra\u2010group statistical analysis was performed using a one\u2010way ANOVA on ranks with P < 0.05 being significant. With the exception of throat\u2010clear, cough was distinguished from every other evaluated AB by one or more of the analyzed waveform parameters (P < 0.001). No between\u2010subject differences were identified between cough and throat\u2010clear groups for any waveform parameter. All other behaviors showed statistically significant within\u2010group variation (P < 0.001). Cough and throat\u2010clear (a clinically similar mechanism to protect the airways) have repeatable acoustic features that are distinguishable from other common AB and are consistent between dogs. Acoustic monitoring may provide an objective means for evaluating cough in dogs with respiratory disease and assessing response to therapeutic intervention.",

Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a promising indirect renal biomarker that correlates closely with GFR in healthy geriatric and CKD cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate SDMA reliability as a renal biomarker in hyperthyroid cats. Forty\u2010seven client\u2010owned hyperthyroid non\u2010azotemic (creatinine <168 \u03bcmol/L) cats were prospectively enrolled and treated with radioiodine (131I). Antithyroid medication was discontinued 10 days prior to 131I treatment. Cats had to be free of any other medication at least for 14 days prior to 131I treatment and free of any other clinically relevant systemic disease. Creatinine and SDMA (IDEXX SDMATM Test) were determined before (T0) and 1 month after (T1) treatment. GFR (plasma exogenous creatinine clearance test) was measured at T0 and T1 in 10 of 47 cats. As expected, creatinine significantly increased (P < 0.001) and GFR significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after 131I treatment. SDMA did not significantly change over time (P = 0.37). Only 1 cat became azotemic (creatinine >168 \u03bcmol/L) at T1 while having normal SDMA at both time points. SDMA was elevated (>14 \u03bcg/dL) in 6 of 47 cats at T0 and normalized after treatment in 4 cats. GFR was available in 1 of these 6 cats and was within normal limits (SDMA normalized at T1). SDMA at T1 was increased above 14 \u03bcg/dL in 1 cat with borderline low GFR which was defined as GFR <1.9 ml/min/kg. Pearson correlation (n = 10) between GFR and SDMA was moderate to low (r = \u22120.48, P = 0.16 at T0 and r = \u22120.36, P = 0.31 at T1) and correlation between GFR and creatinine was moderate (r = \u22120.54, P = 0.11 at T0 and r = \u22120.51, P = 0.13 at T1). Forty of forty\u2010one cats with pre\u2010treatment SDMA within reference interval remained non\u2010azotemic post\u2010treatment. However, not enough patients became azotemic post\u2010treatment to evaluate if SDMA can predict post\u2010treatment renal azotemia. Previous studies showed that SDMA is a promising renal biomarker but further studies are necessary to more fully assess its utility in feline hyperthyroidism.",

We hypothesized that urinary interleukin (IL) 6 (IL\u20106) and 18 (IL\u201018) are sensitive and specific markers of AKI. Urine samples from healthy dogs, dogs with lower urinary tract disease (LUTD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI) and at risk for AKI, were collected. Urine concentrations of IL\u20106 and 18 were measured using ELISA and corrected to urinary creatinine (uIL\u20106.18/uCr). Sixty\u2010six dogs were included. There was a positive correlation between IL\u20106 and IL\u201018 (P < 0.001, r: \u22120.65). Median uIL\u20106/uCr of healthy, LUTD, CKD, AKI and dogs at risk were 0.026 pg/mg (range:0.01\u20132.28), 0.04 pg/mg (range:0.02\u20132.93), 0.08 pg/mg (range:0.04\u20138.28), 0.46 pg/mg (range:0.06\u201358.05) and 6.5 pg/mg (range:0.04\u201319.74) respectively.

There was a significant difference in uIL\u20106/uCr and uIL\u201018/uCr among the study groups, with both higher in the AKI group compared with other groups, except uIL\u201018/uCr, which was not different between the AKI and CKD groups. Median uIL\u20106/uCr and uIL\u201018/uCr of dogs at risk for AKI, were higher compared with healthy dogs (P = 0.034, P = 0.045 respectively). ROC analysis of uIL\u20106/uCr and uIL\u201018/uCr as AKI predictors had an area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.78 respectively. uIL\u20106/uCr and uIL\u201018/uCr cut\u2010off points of 0.11 and 0.13 were associated with sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 70% respectively, and 83% and 70% respectively.

The microbiology database of the U\u2010Vet Werribee Animal Hospital was screened for urinary E. coli isolated from dogs with at least two positive urine cultures. Comorbidities on the date of the respective urine culture were retrieved from the dogs\u2019 medical records. E. coli strains were recovered from frozen storage banks and subjected to whole genome sequencing. The core genome of study strains was compared to reference strain ABU83097 and multi\u2010locus sequence types (MLST) were identified. Strain resistomes were determined by searching genomes for 38 known antibiotic resistance genes. Seventy\u2010six E. coli strains from 19 dogs were analyzed. All dogs had conditions that predisposed to UTI and were treated with antibiotics after positive urine cultures. The number of examined E. coli strains per individual dog ranged from 2 to 8 (median 3.5); they had originally been recovered over a median time span of 146.5 days (range 9\u20132450 days). Overall, E. coli were phylogenetically diverse; 25 different MLST were recorded. Core genomes were 73.9\u201395.2% similar to the reference. None of the E. coli isolated had identical core genomes. However, in 18/19 dogs, 2 to 6 (median 2.5) E. coli with highly similar core genomes (with single nucleotide differences ranging from 25 to 457) were identified. These highly similar E. coli had originally been cultured from urine of affected dogs over a median time span of 84 days (range 7 to 602 days) and in 15/18 cases, all highly similar strains had identical resistomes over time. In 10 dogs, at least one strain that was phylogenetically different was also present; in 3 dogs, these strains were cultured between episodes with 2 highly similar strains. Thirty\u2010five of 76 strains (46%) were phenotypically multi\u2010drug\u2010resistant (MDR). Up to 13 different antibiotic resistance genes (median 2.5) were identified. There was no apparent correlation between time point of strain isolation (i.e. late or early in disease) and MDR status. Results of this study suggest that the majority of E. coli isolated from the urine of dogs with comorbidities either belong to one evolving lineage, or that several highly similar lineages co\u2010exist in any given dog. Changes in resistome were uncommon.",

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for response, outcome, and toxicity. Data was available for 83 dogs with a median age of 11 years and a median weight of 23 kg. Sixty percent of patients had presumed metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Twenty four percent were hypercalcemic at the time of diagnosis. Seventy\u2010seven percent received previous therapy including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Toceranib was a first\u2010line systemic agent in 48% of dogs, either adjunct to previous local therapy or as the sole treatment modality. Median toceranib dosage was 2.7 mg/kg with a median treatment duration of 126 days. Most adverse events were mild, but resulted in dose alteration and/or treatment holiday in 53% and drug discontinuation in 38%. Objective response rate was 62% with an additional 23% of patients experiencing stable disease. Twenty two percent of patients were alive at time of statistical analysis, 23% died of disease, and 23% were lost to follow up. Median overall survival time (OST) was 1395 days. Median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was 1247 days, including patients who received additional therapy after toceranib. Median progression\u2010free interval (PFI) was 328 days. Response to toceranib was associated with previous treatment (P: 0.026) and lack of previous steroid therapy (P: 0.012). On multivariate analysis, only tumor size at diagnosis was prognostic for OST (P: 0.018), although presence of metastasis at diagnosis showed a trend towards significance (P: 0.055). Tumor size at diagnosis, lack of previous steroid therapy, and metastasis at diagnosis were all prognostic for PFI on multivariate analysis (P: 0.01, 0.035, and 0.020, respectively). Neither response to toceranib therapy nor previous treatment (other than toceranib) were significantly associated with outcome.",

Our objectives were to determine the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of GA\u2010198AuNP administered intralesionally to dogs with spontaneously occurring carcinoma of the prostate. The hypothesis was that intralesional GA\u2010198AuNP would cause short term swelling but cause no systemic toxicity and result in tumor stabilization or shrinkage. Following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval, dogs with a diagnosis of prostate carcinoma without bladder involvement were eligible for enrollment with informed owner consent. Staging was performed and injection of GA\u2010198AuNP was achieved with CT guidance (100\u2013200 \u03bcL per site in multiple sites, total amount varied based on tumor size). A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were performed weekly for 4 weeks following treatment; a CT scan was performed 4 weeks after treatment. Nuclear scintigraphy was performed regularly (15 min, 1 h, 4 h, 1, 2, 4, and 5 days post\u2010injection) to determine the degree of retention of GA\u2010198AuNP in the prostate. Following the 4 week trial period, chemotherapy could be started at the discretion of the pet owner. Twenty\u2010two dogs were enrolled; 3 dogs had metastasis to the lymph nodes in the sublumbar region and 19 dogs had no evidence of metastasis. Two dogs were treated to a biologically equivalent dose of 50 Gy and 20 dogs were treated to 105 Gy. One dog died 12 days post injection due to urethral obstruction from either tumor swelling or disease progression. Following this event, dogs with evidence of urethral obstruction had urethral stents placed (n = 15) prior to treatment. Fifteen dogs received chemotherapy. The median survival time of dogs receiving chemotherapy was 132 days (range 55\u2013420 days) compared to 56 days (range 12\u2013255 days) in dogs that did not. The average tumor retention of GA\u2010198AuNP was 70% at 5 days post\u2010injection; loss occurred into the urine through the bladder. No accumulation of dose was found in heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney as determined by whole body planar imaging up to 5 days post\u2010treatment. The median reduction in tumor volume was 10% one month after GA\u2010198AuNP therapy in 14 dogs. In conclusion, intratumoral administration of GA\u2010198AuNP caused no acute systemic toxicities in any dog and may be effective in decreasing tumor size, however, local tumor swelling is possible and dogs must be closely monitored for evidence of urethral obstruction.",

            "text": "Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) infection leads to severe leukopenia and gastrointestinal signs in cats, with mortality rate of up to 70%. Besides supportive therapy, information regarding specific treatments is yet very limited in affected cats. Class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG\u2010A) are short single\u2010stranded DNA molecules containing unmethylated cytosine\u2010phosphate\u2010guanosine motifs that stimulate production of type I interferons. Studies in cats showed the ability of CpG\u2010A to induce an antiviral state in vivo and to inhibit replication of FPV in vitro. Therefore, aims of this study were to investigate the effects of CpG\u2010A on survival and clinical score, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet counts, as well as viremia and fecal viral shedding in cats naturally infected with FPV. Cats with positive fecal parvovirus antigen test were prospectively enrolled if presenting clinical or laboratory sings of FPV, had body weight >500 g, were unvaccinated and not previously treated. Cats were randomly allocated to receive 100 \u00b5g/kg of CpG\u2010A or placebo subcutaneously, at admission and after 48 h; all cases were treated with supportive therapy. A clinical score derived from attitude, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea and temperature was assigned daily until death or during 7 days. Blood and fecal samples were collected at admission and at 1, 2, 7 days; complete blood counts were obtained and real\u2010time PCR was performed to quantify FPV DNA in blood and fecal samples. Chi\u2010square test and mixed ANOVA were used to compare treatment groups. Forty\u2010two cats were included: 22 received CpG\u2010A and 20 placebo. Survival rate did not differ between cats treated with CpG\u2010A and placebo [11 of 22 (50%) vs. 8 of 20 (40%), respectively; P = 0.516]. Differences between groups were not observed for clinical score, RBC, platelets, viremia and fecal viral shedding at any time point. Mean WBC count was higher in cats treated with CpG\u2010A than with placebo at 7 days (25,800 \u00b1 13,800/\u00b5L vs. 14,900 \u00b1 8400/\u00b5L, respectively; P = 0.017) but not at the other time points. All cats showed discomfort during CpG\u2010A injections. In conclusion, treatment with CpG\u2010A did not improve survival or clinical score and did not reduce viral shedding, suggesting that the drug or the treatment regimen used in this study is not beneficial in cats affected with FPV. The lack of favorable response to CpG\u2010A might be due to the delayed improvement of WBC counts. Of note, the administration of CpG\u2010A may be painful in cats.",

The current study examines the association between B. rossi infection and serum concentrations of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the major circulating vitamin D metabolite.

Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that hypovitaminosis D was not significantly correlated with the time from last meal (anorexia).

Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosis of bacteremia, but are infrequently obtained due to technical and practical difficulties in sample acquisition. In ill patients, urine cultures are sometimes recommended as surrogates for blood cultures as part of a \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d approach. This study evaluated the ability of urine culture to predict blood\u2010stream infection. We retrospectively evaluated all blood, aerobic, and anaerobic cultures submitted at NC State Veterinary Hospital between 2011 and 2016. We calculated growth rates of 18% (blood), 24% (urine), and 61% (non\u2010urine) from 511 blood, 6797 urine, and 6552 non\u2010urine cultures submitted. Blood isolates were most commonly coagulase\u2010positive Staphylococcus spp (27%) and Escherichia coli (14%); Escherichia coli was the most common urinary isolate (43%), along with Enterococcus (14%) and coagulase\u2010positive Staphylococcus (11%). 324 urine and blood samples were submitted in parallel, of which 21 yielded simultaneous growth. Of these, only 14 samples were concordant, while 7 yielded discordant urinary and bloodstream infections. Overall, urinary isolates were poorly reflective of bloodstream isolates, with a sensitivity of 24% but a specificity of 87%. General concordance, including true positive (n = 14) and true negatives (n = 232), between urinary and bloodstream isolates was 76%. Urine culture isolates had a poor positive predictive value (29%) but a negative predictive value of 84% for bloodstream infection. An apparent exception is patients with suspected urogenital infection sources (renal, prostatic, etc), in which 100% (n = 7) had concordant urinary and bloodstream infections. Coagulase\u2010positive Staphylococcus infections were most likely to be concordant. 133 non\u2010urine samples submitted in parallel with blood cultures were also evaluated; only biliary and intravenous catheter samples carried a PPV >40%. In short, we recommend that if bloodstream infection is suspected, blood cultures be acquired. Coagulase\u2010positive Staphylococci, if isolated from urinary tract of ill patient, should raise clinical suspicion of a potential concordant bloodstream infection. Due to a high discordance rate, in particular, blood cultures should be performed in any potentially septic animal who is immunosuppressed. Bacteriuria is neither a substitute nor a screen for bacteremia, and in fact, based off of our calculated false negative rate, treatment of urinary tract pathogens in likely bacteremic animals would lead to treatment for the incorrect bloodstream pathogen 76% of the time. Though urine cultures are encouraged as part of a complete diagnostic workup, they do not substitute for blood cultures.",

A clinical validation included 273 samples collected from 214 cats. 201 samples were collected from 195 exposed cats without lesions; 72 samples were collected from 19 cats with confirmed dermatophytosis lesions. Culture was positive in 17 lesion samples from 7 dermatophytosis confirmed cats. PCR was positive in 15 of those samples, as well as in an additional 7 positive lesion samples from a total of 8 cats. Culture was 87% sensitive and 88% specific when compared to PCR on lesioned samples. Cats without lesions but exposed to diseased cats were also tested to determine if PCR is too sensitive by detecting fomite carriers. PCR detected 7 positive samples from 4 exposed cats; compared to 10 culture positives from 10 exposed cats. Of the 19 cats with lesions, 6 were monitored at regular intervals during systemic and topical therapy. The average time to resolution was 47 days. The shortest duration to resolution was 23 days. It is therefore recommended that PCR monitoring should start at around 3 weeks of treatment. In summary, qPCR compared to conventional culture showed excellent sensitivity in clinical cases with lesions, did not pick up significant false positive signals in cats exposed to but not infected with Dermatophytes and can be used to monitor therapy success. Paired with its speed to result, the qPCR panel has excellent utility in the diagnosis of Dermatophytosis.",

Median (range) age and weight at presentation were 12 (10\u201314) years and 26 (19\u201329.3) kg, respectively. All cases were medium to large breed dogs. Duration of clinical signs ranged from 3 days to 3 months with clinical signs including regurgitations (7), weight loss (6), cough (4), polydipsia (3), ptyalism (2), lethargy (2), cachexia (2), and increased lung sounds (2). Plain thoracic radiographs showed a megaesophagus (7), a soft\u2010tissue opacity within the caudal esophagus (3), and signs of aspiration pneumonia (2). GEJ mass was confirmed by contrast esophagogram in two dogs. Transabdominal ultrasonography of the GEJ was performed in 6 dogs and was abnormal in 5 dogs. Endoscopy performed in 4 cases revealed a protruding mass in all cases. CT imaging performed in 3 cases showed a mass at the GEJ. One dog was treated by GEJ stenting, resulting in resolution of clinical signs; this dog is still alive. Six dogs were euthanized before diagnosis or lost to follow\u2010up. Biopsies of the esophageal masses were obtained endoscopically (2), surgically (1) or after necropsy (3) and revealed esophageal leiomyoma (3) and leiomyosarcoma (1) but the endoscopic samples were non\u2010diagnostic. Considering that long term survival is possible, this case series emphasizes the importance of using additional imaging diagnostic procedures before diagnosing idiopathic megaesophagus.",

CE has been described in dogs as a method to evaluate for gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. CE may be a valuable tool in reassessment of dogs that previously were evaluated by TE. This study describes the use of capsule endoscopy (CE) in dogs following traditional endoscopy (TE). Ten dogs were retrospectively identified that received CE within 6 months of TE (range 0\u2013151 days). Seven dogs received CE for assessment of suspected gastrointestinal hemorrhage; CE detected gastrointestinal mucosal lesions in the stomach and jejunum (n = 2), diffusely throughout SI and colon (n = 2), jejunum (n = 1), ileum (n = 1), and colon (n = 1) that were not detected with TE. Three dogs received CE to assess lack of response to therapy in dogs with chronic enteropathy. In these dogs, CE detected persistent gastric erosions and duodenal mucosal changes seen previously with TE; in 2/3 dogs, CE also identified lesions in additional locations not seen with TE. CE detected gastrointestinal mucosal lesions not detected by TE in 9/10 dogs. Though further investigation is needed, CE appears to be a complementary and informative technique in the management of dogs with chronic GI signs that have undergone TE.",

In cats, hypoalbuminemia in CE is considered infrequent, but specific investigations about protein profile in these patients have been not published . The aim of this study was to evaluate serum protein profiling in cats with IBD and lymphoma, and to compare it with clinical symptoms, endoscopic assessments and histopathological diagnoses. FCEAI clinical index score, CBC, serum biochemical profile and urinalysis were evaluated in 100 cats affected by IBD and lymphoma. Endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract was performed and a severity score from 0 to 3 was assigned based on WSAVA guidelines. Histopathological diagnosis was based on WSAVA guidelines. Total serum protein, serum protein agarose gel electrophoresis, and albumin\u2010globulin ratio (A/G) were evaluated at time of diagnosis. Cats ranged from 1 to 17 years old (10 median), 46% were females and 93% were European shorthair. The histologic diagnosis was IBD (66%) and lymphoma (34%). The most common symptoms were vomiting (70%), weight loss (67%) and diarrhea (37%). Mean FCEAI score was 9.4 \u00b1 2.59. Mean serum total protein was 6.01 \u00b1 0.99 g/dL. Low total protein (5.04 \u00b1 0.63 g/dL) occurred in 41% of cats and only 10% had hypoalbuminemia. Beta globulins were decreased in 70% of cats, and gamma globulins were increased in 75%. A/G ratio was significantly higher in cats with hypoproteinemia (1.1 \u00b1 0.3) compared to non\u2010hypoproteinemic cats (0.9 \u00b1 0.1). No statistical differences between protein profile and symptoms, FCEAI, gastrointestinal tract concerned, endoscopic score, type and severity of histologic pattern were found. Despite the hypoproteinemia was a relatively frequent finding in this work, a correlation with the clinical variables was not established. In addition, the clinical severity, the endoscopic and histological grading was not related to protein profile. Dysproteinemia with low beta globulin and high gamma globulin were the most common alterations. In hypoproteinemic cats A/G was higher than in non\u2010hypoproteinemic cats. The decrease of beta globulin could be due to malnutrition but also to iron metabolism modifications occurring in chronic inflammatory disease, with reduction of transferrin and ferritin. Hypergammaglobulinemia is reported in human medicine as a common feature of IBD associated to extraintestinal manifestation. No data so far are available for the prevalence and clinical significance in cats.",

This fact is especially important in order to identify B2 patients \u2010ACVIM classification\u2010 that can benefit from starting medication or to prevent congestive heart failure. The vena contracta is the narrowest portion of a jet downstream from the regurgitant orifice. The objective of the present study is to prove if the vena contracta could be used as criteria for classification in dogs with DCMVD. One hundred and thirteen dogs suffering from DCMVD in different phases according to ACVIM classification, have been included: B1, n = 54; B2, n = 51 and C, n = 8. The vena contracta was measured from the parasternal left apical four\u2010chamber long axis view. Three measurements were obtained for each dog and the average was obtained. The results showed a statistically significant difference between stages for end\u2010diastolic left ventricular index (EDVI), end\u2010systolic left ventricular index (ESVI) and vena contracta (Kruskal\u2010Wallis for independent samples test). The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P = 0.022) and between B1 and C dogs (P = 0.035) for vena contracta. The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P < 0.0001) and between B1 and C dogs (P < 0.001) for EDVI. The differences were significant between B1 dogs and B2 dogs (P = 0.044) and between B1 and C dogs (P = 0.032) for ESVI. There were no differences for these values between B2 and C dogs. The vena contracta appears to be useful to differentiate between early phases of DCMVD and congestive phase of DCMVD but it seems less useful to differentiate between B2 dogs and C dogs. It is important to remember that this measurement is not useful if multiple jets are present, which is common in dogs with DCMVD. The vena contracta has an ellipsoidal shape so the measurements could vary depending on the plane of acquisition. Due to the fact that the vena contracta usually is small (typically less than 0.5 cm), slight measurement errors could lead to large mistakes and misclassifications. In human, it is recommended to measure the vena contracta from the right parasternal long axis. All of these factors must be taken into consideration from a critical point of view in the face of the present results.",

CMVD develops mainly in small animals, but in chondrodystrophic breeds is more common. Dachshunds are predisposed to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which is a systolic displacement of one or both mitral leaflets beyond the mitral valve annulus. The MVP is associated with marked sinus arrhythmia in Dachshund. The hypothesis is that adult healthy Dachshund dogs are predisposed to exhibit MVP before mitral regurgitation. We performed a prospective study with client\u2010owned animals that were screened by physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, systolic blood pressure measurement, echocardiography and laboratory tests (CBC, biochemical blood urea and creatinine). A complete echocardiographic examination with electrocardiogram monitoring was performed. We enrolled 69 Dachshund healthy dogs (28 [40.6%] males and 41 [59.4%] females); from 18 months to 10 years\u2010old, weighting 8.4 \u00b1 2.3 kg. No heart diseases were observed, including mitral regurgitation. Mild MVP was present in 28 (40.58%). Of these, 24 (85.71%) with sinus arrhythmia, 3 (10.71%) with normal sinus rhythm and 1 (3.57%) with sinus tachycardia.

PHM may be a result of an increased sympathetic tone, and is possible to be secondary to anxiety. It has been described in some breeds and in athletic dogs during adulthood. A cross\u2010sectional study was performed with 69 healthy Dachshunds, including 28 males (40.6%) and 41 females (59.4%), aging between 18 months to 10 years\u2010old and weighting 8.4 \u00b1 2.3 kg. The dogs underwent through physical examination, blood testing, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurement and thoracic radiography. No abnormalities were found. Systolic heart murmurs were detected in 36 dogs (52.2%): 32 (46.4%) with grade II/VI and 4 (5.8%) with grade III/VI (Levine/Freeman Scale). Murmurs were mostly located in mitral valve area (72.2%). Heart murmurs in adult dogs are frequently indicative of pathological conditions. However, none of the 36 dogs had structural heart abnormalities or systemic disturbances. Therefore, this study shows a high prevalence of PHM in healthy adult Dachshunds.",

Test food 1 (TF1) and Test food 2 (TF2) contained 31.8% and 30.2% protein, respectively, as well as 0.04% AA, 0.095% EPA, and 0.06% DHA. Both TF1 and TF2 contained additional bioactive food factors (from broccoli, tomatoes, oats, and peas), with TF2 having increased bioactive ingredient concentrations compared with TF1. Serum was analyzed for FA and PGE2 concentrations initially, and at 45, 90 and 180 days. Concurrently, body composition was determined by dual energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry. After consuming food for 180 days, lean body mass (LBM) was unchanged in cats fed control food (42 \u00b1 30 g), whereas cats fed TF1 (73 \u00b1 30 g; P = 0.02) and TF2 (197 \u00b1 31 g; P < 0.01) had increased LBM. Body fat was unchanged in cats fed control food (\u221211 \u00b1 43 g), but decreased in cats fed TF1 (\u2212124 \u00b1 42 g; P < 0.01) and TF2 (\u2212185 \u00b1 43 g; P < 0.01). PGE2 concentrations were decreased in cats fed control and TFs, and were positively correlated to the ratio of (n\u20106) to (n\u20103) FA in serum (r = 0.31; P < 0.01) and negatively correlated to the sum of (n\u20103) FA (r = ?0.30; P < 0.001). Cats consuming foods containing plant bioactives and fish oil had reduced concentrations of the inflammatory biomarker PGE2 and enhanced lean body composition, which together may aid in offsetting inflammation and adiposity associated with aging in cats.",

The results suggest that the IBW of each dog could be estimated by measuring the BLs\u2010b. The correlation coefficient between the BLs\u2010b and IBW in 5 long bodied dogs (Miniature Dachshund, Welsh Corgi, etc.) was higher than it in the all subject dogs. This suggests that it is better to divide dogs into following three types: standard shape, long and square bodied dogs for the morphometric BCS assessment. In addition, individual BCS can be calculated from an estrangement percentage between IBW and current weight by using above formula.

Inhibition of SGLT2 induces profound renal glucosuria reducing blood glucose and lowering insulin requirements in man. Adverse effects are uncommon. These drugs have not been evaluated in cats to the authors\u2019 knowledge. In this study 3 healthy cats were sequentially dosed with 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg of dapagliflozin for 5 days per treatment with a 2 week washout between each regimen. Cats were housed in individual cages. Hematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis were performed before and after each trial. Daily food, water intake, urine production and 24 h urinary glucose excretion were measured for the duration of each trial. Data was analyzed using a mixed linear model with a fixed effect of \u2018dose\u2019 and \u2018day\u2019, and the random effect of \u2018cat\u2019. Dapagliflozin induced significant glucosuria at all doses used, which persisted for 5 days after the last dose for each regimen. The 10 mg dose induced the most significant increase in daily urine glucose output with a concomitant decrease in daily urine output. One cat developed a mild hyperglobulinemia and leukocytosis, but no other adverse effects were noted. The cats lost weight during each of the trials, which is one of the touted benefits of the drug in human diabetics. Polydipsia/polyuria were not observed, nor were urinary tract infections detected during the trial. In conclusion, dapagliflozin appeared safe and is effective in inducing glucosuria.",

            "text": "Feeding of biologically appropriate raw food (BARF) including gullet is popular: Due to the close anatomical position of the thyroid gland and the respective muscle tissue such diets are likely to be contaminated with thyroid gland tissue and may cause alimentary thyrotoxicosis. However, as controlled studies are missing, it is unclear which effect the absorbed total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) may have on the thyroid hormone status. Because T4 levels are still routinely checked in the elderly dog and commonly in dogs suspicious of behavioral issues it would be of high diagnostic interest, if potential thyroid gland feeding may interfere with the diagnostic approach. Therefore, the present study aimed in investigating the short term effect of thyroid gland feeding on the thyroid hormone concentration in dogs. Bovine thyroid gland from the slaughterhouse (0.5 g/kg body weight) was fed after 12 h fasting together with a complete dry diet. Blood samples were taken 19 days before the experiment in order to verify euthyroidism in the healthy beagle dogs (n = 5). On the day of the feeding experiment blood was taken before (0 and 4, 8, 24, 52 h as well as 6 days after feeding. In the samples T4\u2010, free T4\u2010, T3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAA) were measured either using an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Immulite\u00ae 1000 System, Siemens Diagnostics, USA) or a commercially available TgAA assay (Oxford Laboratories, MI, USA).. No dog had TgAA. After feeding thyroid gland there was an increase up to 7.8 fold basal levels of T4, free T4 and T3 serum concentrations. Serum levels returned to basal levels after 52 h, however, three of five dogs showed T4 and fT4 concentrations below the reference range 52 h and 6 days after single controlled thyroid gland feeding. TSH levels were suppressed after feeding for 52 h. None of the dogs showed any clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Feeding of thyroid tissue to healthy dogs resulted in distinct effects on the thyroid hormone blood concentration. Initially single feeding of thyroid gland lead to considerably higher T4 levels but afterwards also to lower T4 and fT4 concentrations. Therefore, if euthyroidism should be diagnosed, administration of dog food containing thyroid gland should be carefully ruled out for the last seven days.",

Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is considered a biomarker for early detection of renal dysfunction and resulted strongly correlated with GFR in dogs. In humans, SDMA is significantly higher in hypothyroid compared to healthy people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the SDMA concentrations in a population of hypothyroid dogs (HD) at the time of diagnosis (T0) and after treatment (T1). Fourteen dogs affected by spontaneous hypothyroidism and 20 healthy dogs (control group) were included. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism was based on consistent clinical signs, laboratory findings, including serum total T4 and cTSH concentrations below and above the RI, respectively. In dogs with normal cTSH, rhTSH stimulation test was performed to confirm the diagnosis. SCr was measured for diagnostic or check\u2010up purposes and SDMA was measured afterwards from surplus of serum stored at \u221220\u00b0C. In HD such measurements where performed at T0 after 15 to 112 days (median 64.5) of treatment (T1) with levothyroxine (10\u201315 \u00b5g/kg q12 h PO). SDMA was measured using a validated immunoassay (IDEXX SDMA test).HD had a median age of 4 years (4\u201315), median body weight (BW) of 37.5 kg (7.9\u201353), 7/14 were male (1 castrated) and 7/14 female (3 spayed). There were no significant differences regarding signalment and BW between HD and control group. Median SDMA concentrations (RI <14 \u00b5g/dL) were 10 \u00b5g/dL (6\u201317), 13.5 \u00b5g/dL (7\u201320) and 10.5 \u00b5g/dL (5\u201317) in healthy dogs, HD at T0 and T1, respectively. SDMA concentrations were significantly higher in HD at T0 in comparison with healthy dogs (P < 0.029) and HD at T1 (P < 0.031). Among HD, 7/14 had SDMA above the RI at T0 and only 1/14 (7%) at T1. At T0, 4/14 HD had SCr above the RI (>1.35 mg/dL). SCr concentration was significantly higher in HD at T0 compared to HD at T1 (P < 0.0082), and in one dog SCr was above the RI at T1. No significant correlation was observed between SDMA and T4, and SDMA and SCr in the HD at T0 and T1.",

The active components of papaya carica extract have been proved earlier to inhibit immune mediated platelet destruction and possible bone marrow suppression to fasten the natural course of recovery by increasing the platelet counts. In this report we studied the effect of Caprica papaya in the treatment of infectious thrombocytopenia in dogs. During a one\u2010year period 60 thrombocytopenic dogs with ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and/or leptospirosis referred to Madras Veterinary College Teaching Hospital were studied. They had mild (platelets 50,000\u2013100,000/\u00b5l) to severe (platelets 25,000\u201350,000/\u00b5l) thrombocytopenia and evidence of bleeding. In addition coagulation profiles, buccal mucosal bleeding times, saline agglutination tests, spherocyte reviews, direct Coombs\u2019 (Direct Antiglobulin) tests, von Willebrand Factor assays, platelet\u2010associated antibody (PSAb) assays, bone marrow aspiration cytology, and DEA 1 typings were determined. Platelet\u2010rich plasma or fresh whole blood were transfused in case of severe (platelets <20,000 cells/\u00b5L) thrombocytopenia and/or anemia and all dogs received doxycycline and prednisone for ehrlichiosis and leptospirosis, Imidocarb for babesiosis,. Carica papaya leaf extract was administered at 5 mL per 10 kg body weight twice a day for 3 weeks. Platelet counts increased significantly faster in dogs receiving Carica papaya from day 2\u20137 compared to those receiving only other treatments. Also the bleeding signs appear to improve more rapidly with Carica papaya, and no side effects were observed. In conclusion Carica papaya may be an inexpensive, easily available thrombopoietic supplement to more rapidly control thrombocytopenia and bleeding in dogs with hemoprotozoan diseases along with transfusions, specific infectious disease and immunosuppression.",

The Pug breed is predisposed for specific orthopedic conditions and neuromuscular problems in the Pug breed has become increasingly recognized in the last few years. Lameness, as the result of musculoskeletal problems, and spinal cord disorders, characterized by paresis and ataxia, were reported in a British study in 2.4% versus 1.4% of the Pugs attending primary veterinary care. The prevalence of spinal cord disorders presented from the United Kingdom poorly corresponds to a Swedish insurance data report suggesting a seven\u2010fold increase in mortality rate for ataxia, paresis and collapse in Pugs compared to other breeds. Adding the attention \u2018wobbly Pugs\u2019 are given on the internet suggests a need to investigate the prevalence of gait abnormalities in the Pug in a systematic way. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of gait abnormalities in a cohort of Swedish Pugs by using an owner\u2010based questionnaire targeting signs of gait abnormality and video footage showing the dog\u00b4s gait. The study also aimed at evaluating associated conditions of abnormal gait; including other health disorders prevalent in the breed. The owners reported gait aberrations in 20.2 % of the Pugs with a prevalence increase with increasing age. Adding the Pugs that were reported to show indirect signs of gait abnormalities (wearing their nails and dorsal aspect of the skin on their paws) increased the prevalence of gait abnormalities in the breed from 20.2% to 30.7%. These results suggest gait abnormalities to be a more significant health problem than previously reported. Indeed, the single, listed, most common cause for death/euthanasia, reported by the owners, was a gait abnormality. In conclusion, gait abnormalities were a common finding in the Pug breed. Wearing of the nails and/or skin on the dorsum of the paws, predominately in the thoracic limbs, were frequently found and from a comparably young age. The result of the questionnaire and the video analysis suggest neurological disorders are predominately responsible for the high prevalence of gait abnormalities in the Pug breed. The prevalence of abnormal gait was significantly associated with age and with dyspnea. The gait abnormalities were not associated with overt signs of pain but were associated with reluctance to go for walks.",

The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective, multicenter review of clinical data relating to dogs and cats diagnosed with dysautonomia and to evaluate the outcome in those patients. Cats and dogs with clinical signs consistent with dysautonomia were included in this retrospective study. A total of 34 cats and 19 dogs were included. Reported clinical signs included esophageal, gastric and intestinal dysmotility and distension, urinary retention and dysuria, reduced or absent tear production, third eyelid protrusion and inappropriate mydriasis. Vomiting and regurgitation were commonly reported in both species (cats n = 29/34, dogs n = 17/19), while signs consistent with urinary retention were primarily reported in dogs (n = 14/19) and third eyelid protrusion was more frequently reported in cats (n = 20/34). Diagnostic imaging findings included aspiration pneumonia, megaesophagus, gastrointestinal dilation with either fluid or gas and bladder distension. Esophageal dilation was the most often identified diagnostic imaging finding in cats (n = 20/34), while in dogs gastrointestinal distension was most commonly identified (n = 5/19). Regularly instituted treatments included gastrointestinal prokinetics such as cisapride and metoclopramide, feeding tube placement (esophageal and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes) and medications to treat urinary retention such as bethanechol. The overall survival to discharge was 36%. The mortality rate prior to discharge was 71% in cats and 53% in dogs. Longer term survival (greater than two years) was seen in three dogs and six cats. In this retrospective study clinical signs, diagnostic imaging findings, treatment and prognosis were all similar to previous retrospective publications. This paper has illustrated that some individuals are able to survive this disease and can have a good long\u2010term prognosis. Prospective studies are required to identify risk factors that indicate whether a patient is likely to survive and thus if it is worth embarking upon treatment.",

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the macroscopic endoscopic exam of the bronchial mucosa for the diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. A retrospective multi\u2010institutional diagnostic accuracy study was performed including all the dogs presenting with acute or chronic coughs and that underwent bronchial endoscopy by the Endovet Italian Group between January 2014 and December 2016. The reference standard was the cytological evaluation of the bronchoalveolar lavage. The primary outcome was sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of endoscopic visualization of nodules for the diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. Of the 845 cases studied, a total of 781 dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria with cytological evaluation of the bronchoalveolar lavage. The dogs ranged in age from 0.4 to 16 years (8.0 median, 4.0 SD), in body weight from 1.5 to 45 kg (13.0 median, 9.5 SD), and 325 (41.6%) were females. A final diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis was given for 113 (15.6%) cases, and 99 (13.6%) presented nodules during macroscopic endoscopy. In the final logistic regression model, detection of nodules during endoscopy, higher age, and lower body weight were associated with a diagnosis of eosinophilic bronchitis. Odds of having eosinophilic bronchitis were 34.4% (18.9\u201362.6; P < 0.001) greater in dogs presenting nodules during endoscopy. The risk of eosinophilic bronchitis increased by 23% (14\u201332%; P < 0.001) for a one\u2010year increase in age, and by 3% (0\u20135%; P = 0.048) for each kilogram decrease in body weight. Visualization of nodules during endoscopy had a sensitivity of 56.6% (47.0\u201365.9%), specificity of 94.3% (92.3\u201395.9%), positive predictive value of 62.7% (54.3\u201370.5%), and negative predictive value of 92.8% (91.2\u201394.1%). Based on the high specificity and high negative predictive value, visualization of nodules during endoscopy is highly indicative of eosinophilic bronchitis. However, the lack of visualization of nodules during endoscopy does not exclude the presence of eosinophilic bronchitis.",

Due to the relative invasiveness and potential adverse effects, the use of renal biopsy is limited among practitioners. In this study we evaluate the intensity of renal damage induced by renal cortex sampling and the clinical consequences of such a procedure. We examined 28 dogs, mixed breed and variable ages, 11 (39, 29 %) males and 17 (60, 71 %) females that were referred to our clinic and underwent ultrasound guided renal biopsy in order to establish a definite diagnosis. Patients were presented with a variety of diffuse nephropathies: kidney lymphoma: 1 (3.57%), glomerulonephritis: 13 (46.43%), tubulointerstitial nephritis: 11 (39.29 %) and nephrocalcinosis: 3 (10.71%) of which 18 (64.29 %) were in acute kidney failure and 10 (35.71 %) were chronic renal patients. The type and the severity of renal lesions were correlated with changes in urinary NAG index (iNAG), and specific serum renal damage markers such as urea, creatinine, phosphorus and ionized calcium. To quantify the side effects of percutaneous renal biopsy the magnitude of post biopsy hematuria and changes in urinary iNAG activity were evaluated. The results indicate a significant post biopsy increase in urinary iNAG activity in all patients that underwent this procedure (100.08 \u00b1 34.45 (U/g) pre\u2010biopsy iNAG vs. 147.65 \u00b1 33.26 (U/g) post\u2010biopsy iNAG, P < 0.001) suggesting an intensification in renal tubular damage consecutive to kidney puncture and sampling.",

Whereas prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a biomarker is controversially discussed for early detection in human medicine, potential biomarkers have not yet been established for dogs. Gene expression data sets, generated by next generation sequencing, offer new possibilities in cancer research for biomarker discovery, understanding of carcinogenesis and development of therapeutic strategies. Since ultrasound\u2010guided fine\u2010needle aspiration biopsies (US\u2010FNA) of the prostate are routinely used for cytology in dogs, aspirated cells can represent a source for gene expression studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate US\u2010FNA material for routine cytologic diagnosis and leftover cells for molecular biological analysis. US\u2010FNAs were taken prospectively from 16 male dogs after clinical examination. Collected cells were used for cytological examination as well as molecular biological analysis. Prostate tissue samples were taken from 18 euthanized dogs. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from US\u2010FNA samples using the miRNeasy\u00aeMicro Kit and RNA concentration was measured with Qubit. Prostate tissue samples were classified histopathologically. RNA isolation from prostate tissue was performed with AllPrep\u00aeDNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit and quantity was measured with the Synergy system. A bioanalyzer was used to determine RNA\u2010integrity number (RIN). Whole transcriptome next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 system. Tissue samples were examined histologically: Nine were diagnosed as malignant and nine were classified as non\u2010neoplastic. Cytological examination of US\u2010FNA was possible in 14 cases, eleven being diagnosed as normal to hyperplastic and three specimens being classified as prostate carcinoma. RNA concentration was detectable in all samples ranging from 9 ng/\u00b5L to 99 ng/\u00b5L. RNA quantity was sufficient as starting material for NGS. Transcriptome analyses from samples with RIN value \u22655.5 were successful. Data sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were summarized in principal component analysis and showed major variances in DEGs between non\u2010neoplastic and malignant samples and minor differences between US\u2010FNA and tissue with comparable diagnosis. Globin genes were identified and significantly upregulated in US\u2010FNA samples. Based on isolated total RNA concentration and integrity, residual cells from diagnostic US\u2010FNA of the canine prostate can be considered as an adequate sample source for gene expression studies, biomarker research and a potential tool for advanced diagnostic of canine prostatic diseases.",

However, there are no studies that have investigated the presence of L. infantum infection in dogs diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by clinical and histopathological examination. The objectives of this study were to retrospectively investigate the presence of Leishmania infection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in archived canine colonic biopsies previously diagnosed with IBD in an area endemic for canine leishmaniosis as well as to describe the main histopathological findings. A total of 109 cases of canine colitis were retrospectively retrieved from the archived of biopsies of Servei de Diagn\u00f2stic de Patologia of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona. Information regarding clinicopathological data including signalment, histological results and further diagnostic testing to detect Leishmania infection such as Leishmania IHC staining was compiled from the selected cases. Lymphoplasmacytic (n = 101), histiocytic (n = 5), and lymphoplasmacytic with mild eosinophilic/neutrophilic component (n = 3) colitis were diagnosed between January 1997 and September 2015 performed by endoscopic colonic biopsies. Interestingly, Leishmania IHC was only carried out in 13 out of 109 (11.9 %) colonic samples to confirm or exclude Leishmania infection based on the diagnostic database. From those, 5 were diagnosed as granulomatous and 8 as lymphoplasmacytic colitis. Four biopsies were classified as positive, two as unclear results due to unspecific background staining and the rest were negative for Leishmania IHC. Leishmania IHC was performed in 56 out of the remaining 96 colonic samples with a diagnosis of lymphoplasmocytic or histiocytic inflammation that were not previously tested to confirm or exclude this infection. Due to economical restrictions, only 56 colonic samples retrieved could be investigated. Only one out of 56 (1.8%) colonic biopsies examined was classified as positive by IHC. A total of 5 out of 109 (4.6%) dogs were diagnosed with Leishmania infection. Two dogs presented intense histiocytic inflammation while three dogs showed mild to intense lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. The number of amastigotes per 5 microscopic fields viewed at 40\u00d7 assessed by IHC was variable and ranged between 2 to countless. In conclusion, Leishmania infection should be included in the list of differentials of inflammatory colonic biopsies. Leishmania amastigotes are commonly not visualized by routine histological staining. Therefore, IHC for Leishmania should be routinely used as a diagnostic tool in endemic areas of leishmaniosis, to exclude or confirm an infection by this parasite in patients with a diagnosis of IBD.",

Consequently, feral cats can act as both a reservoir for possible zoonotic diseases as well as a sentinel species for seroprevalence in other animal populations. We assessed the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with exposure to Leptospira, Toxoplasma and Dirofilaria in a population of feral cats from the American Midwest. Serum samples from a total of 140 cats were available for testing. Twelve cats (8.6%) were seropositive for leptospirosis based on a microscopic agglutination test titer of 1:100 or greater. Bratislava was the most commonly reported serovar, accounting for 6/12 positive titers. Forty\u2010two cats (30%) were seropositive for Toxoplasma based on competitive ELISA testing and nine cats (5.3%) were seropositive for Dirofilaria antibodies based on a lateral flow immunoassay. All of the cats for which a Dirofilaria antigen test was performed were negative. Body weight and sexual status was not significantly correlated with seropositivity to any of the studied pathogens. Seropositivity to one pathogen was not found to be a risk factor for seropositivity to other pathogens. Seroprevalence for leptospirosis was significantly greater in spring than in fall (P = 0.023) and varied significantly between age groups (P = 0.014). Similarly, seroprevalence for Toxoplasma varied according to age with cats between 73 and 120 months of age being significantly overrepresented (P = 0.013). Compared to previous seroprevalence reports of feline feral populations from the United States and abroad, this population of cats from the American Midwest had a slightly lower seroprevalence of Toxoplasma but higher seroprevalence of leptospirosis.",

Concurrent infections with gastrointestinal parasites and canine corona virus exacerbate clinical disease, increasing mortality. The ability of bacterial pathogens to potentiate clinical signs has not been thoroughly investigated. Enteropathogenic E. coli, defined by the presence of the eae gene, produce characteristic attaching and effacing lesions on the enterocyte brush border. These E. coli have been identified in up to 36% of dogs with both acute and chronic diarrhea suggesting a pathogenic role. Dogs with severe diarrhea infected with enteropathogenic E. coli have clinical signs and gross pathological lesions that are indistinguishable from parvovirus infection. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of eae positive E. coli in dogs with parvoviral enteritis. Twenty five dogs admitted to the Veterinary Medical Centre in Saskatoon, Canada were included in this study if they met the following criteria: 1. Less than two years of age, 2. Acute onset vomiting and/or diarrhea and 3. Incomplete vaccination history. Feces were cultured and E. coli identified using standard biochemical methods. Isolates were screened for the eae gene by PCR, and amplicon identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Feces were evaluated for gastrointestinal parasites by floatation and for giardia and cryptosporidium by immunofluorescent antibody. Complete blood count, serum biochemical profile or venous blood gas, urinalysis and parvovirus fecal ELISA were performed for each dog to identify other potential causes of gastroenteritis. E. coli were cultured from feces of 92% (23/25) of dogs, 8.7% (2/23) were eae positive. All dogs were identified as Parvovirus positive including: 22/25 dogs by fecal ELISA, 1/25 by immunohistochemistry and 2/25 by histopathological examination. Fecal culture identified Clostridium perfringens in 17/24 and Campylobacter in 3/24 dogs. Salmonella were not identified. Concurrent gastrointestinal parasitism was identified in 5/20 dogs tested, identifying Isospora (2/20), Sarcocystis (1/20), and Toxascaris (1/20). Giardia sp. were identified in 2/20 by flotation or IFA. The role of these organisms as canine intestinal pathogens is poorly defined. The low prevalence of eae positive E. coli identified among young dogs with parvovirus suggests that these organisms are unlikely to be significant gut pathogens in patients with parvoviral enteritis. Further study is required to define the role of these potential pathogens in canine enteric disease.",

According to previous studies, B. canis is considered as the main species involved in canine babesiosis, but in recent years more studies show the existence of Babesia gibsoni infected dogs both in Europe and Romania. B. gibsoni infection in dogs is mainly described in American Pit Bull Terriers, although the significance of this breed predisposition is not yet fully understood, however the possibility of both blood\u2010to\u2010blood transfer and transplacental infection has been considered as a possible modality of host contamination. A 3 year old female, American Staffordshire Terrier was referred to our clinic, previously diagnosed with Babesia canis infection and treated with one dose of imidocarb dipropionate three days prior. The dog presented fever, pale mucous membranes and hemoglobinuria. Complete blood count revealed severe anemia (HCT 13%, Hg 4 g/dL, RBC 1.56 \u00d7 1012/L), thrombocytopenia (PLT 32 \u00d7 109/L) and mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Coomb's test (Alvedia) and rapid test for Dirofilaria immitis antigen, Ehlichia canis antigen, Borrelia burgdoferi antigen, Anaplasma phogocytophilum/Anaplasma platys antibody (Rapid CaniV\u20104 Test Kit, Bionote) showed negative results. Giemsa\u2010stained blood films were positive for small (1\u20132.7 \u00b5m) pleomorphic inclusions. Babesia spp. DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, further molecular characterization of the sample showed the involvement of Babesia gibsoni (Macrogen Europe, Amsterdam). Following molecular identification of Babesia gibsoni, combination therapy was initiated with Clindamycin (25 mg/kg PO BID), Doxycycline (15 mg/kg PO BID), and Metronidazole (5 mg/kg PO BID). Fourteen days after therapy Hb, HCT, RBC and PLT values increased, but the blood sample tested positive for B. gibsoni by PCR. Therapy was ceased after 6 weeks, when HCT reached 40% and PCR showed complete B.gibsoni infection sterilization of the patient. Blood samples tested three and six months after the initiation of the treatment remained negative for B. gibsoni. Since the female was 5 weeks post\u2010partum at the time of babesiosis diagnostic was established, four samples from two different litter pups were tested and found negative for B.gibsoni, although transplancetal transmission is possible in B.gibsoni infection. Accurate diagnosis is important in dogs presenting hemolythic anemia, because B.gibsoni is resistant to traditional anti\u2010babesial therapy, but combination therapies may be efficient in order to reduce and eliminate parasitemia.",
