            "text": "PEDV has been exotic in the United States until May 2013. Currently PEDV is spreading rapidly in swine farms in the United States, posing significant economic and public health concerns. To determine the origin and evolution of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States, we characterized four PED cases from Minnesota and two cases from Iowa. Clinical signs were characterized by acute vomiting, anorexia, and watery diarrhea, with high mortality in pigs less than 10 days old. For the four dead neonatal piglets from Minnesota, upon microscopic examination, the piglets had signs of emaciation and dehydration. The gross pathological lesions were confined to the small intestine and were characterized by thin translucent intestinal walls that contained moderate amounts of yellow watery feces without macroscopic traces of blood (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). No other gross abnormalities were noticed. Histological evaluation revealed regions of small intestines with villus blunting and fusion and minimal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the villi of the lamina propria (see Fig. S1B). The gross and histological lesions from the PEDV outbreaks in the United States are similar to those observed in China (14). PEDV RNA was detected in porcine small intestine samples from all four dead piglets from Minnesota by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with primers targeting the N gene (data not shown). Additionally, we also tested fecal and small intestinal samples from diseased suckling pigs from two different Iowa farms. The complete genomes of three representative strains of PEDV from the ongoing outbreaks in the United States\u2014one from Minnesota and two from Iowa, designated strains MN and IA1 and IA2, respectively\u2014were amplified by RT-PCR from total RNAs extracted from the fecal or small intestine sample and genetically characterized.",

Subsequently, a total of eight overlapping fragments covering the entire PEDV genome for each of the three emergent U.S. PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR using PfuUltra II high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), with primers based upon the conserved regions among the CV777 and the Chinese PEDV sequences (Fig. 1A; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The RT-PCR products were individually excised from the agarose gel, purified, and subsequently cloned into a pSC-B-amp/kan vector (Agilent) or a pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). For each amplicon, three to five individual clones were sequenced to determine the consensus sequence of any given genomic region. Sequence contigs with the consensus sequence were assembled into the full-length genome for each of the three emergent U.S. PEDV strains using the Lasergene package (DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI).",

These three U.S. PEDV sequences shared 99.8 to 99.9% nucleotide identities. In particular, strains MN and IA2 had only 11 nucleotide differences across the entire genome. To date, there are a total of 23 complete genomic sequences of PEDV available in the GenBank database, and 19 of them were isolated from pigs in China. Multiple sequence alignments among these 23 sequences together with the 3 emergent U.S. PEDV genomes at the nucleotide as well as the amino acid sequence levels of the replicase (ORF1a/1b), S, ORF3, E, M, and N were performed in an attempt to identify any unique nucleotides and amino acids in the 3 emergent U.S. PEDV genomes. We identified a total of 29 nucleotide differences between the United States strains and the consensus sequence (data not shown), which resulted in eight amino acid changes (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the three emergent U.S. strains all share four additional unique nucleotides (7191A, 10861T, 15594C, and 20343C; two are nonsynonymous changes) (Fig. 1B) with the Chinese AH2012 strain (GenBank accession no. KC210145) and share another four additional unique nucleotides (21869A, 21935T, 23225T, and 25294C [all of them are synonymous]) with the Chinese CH/ZMDZY/11 strain (GenBank accession no. KC196276). Among the eight amino acid changes unique to the U.S. strains plus the two unique to the United States and AH2012, four single amino acid substitutions are located within nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), nsp13, nsp15, and S protein genes, respectively. The remaining six amino acid substitutions are found in the nsp3 gene, including three in the papain-like proteinase 2 (PLP2) domain and two in the Y domain (Fig. 1B). The identification of these unique nucleotide and amino acid changes can now be used as the genetic markers to differentiate the emergent U.S. strains from the other PEDV strains, especially those from China.",

            "text": "In addition, like the other newly isolated PEDV strains, the three emergent U.S. strains contain a notable U insertion at nt 48, and two notable nucleotide deletions between nt 72 and 73 (an A deletion) and between nt 84 and 85 (a 4-nt UUCC deletion), respectively, at the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), in comparison with the prototype CV777 strain (Fig. 1D). Only two PEDV strains isolated from the early period, LZC and SM98, had the same sequences to the CV777 strain in this region. The 5\u2032-UTRs of coronaviruses form conserved RNA structural elements that are involved in viral replication, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcription, and translation (16, 17). Unexpectedly, further comparison with the corresponding regions from the other alphacoronaviruses revealed that the bat coronavirus BtCoV/512/2005 isolated in China had the same one insertion and two deletions at the same positions (denoted by no. 1 to 3 in Fig. 1D). These changes do not alter the conserved RNA secondary structures, including stem-loop 2 (SL2) and SL4, which are conserved in all members of Coronavirinae (Fig. 1D) (16\u201318). The U insertion at position 1 is located on the loop of SL2. It has been shown that sequence conservation and the numbers of nucleotides in the predicted SL2 loop play an important role in betacoronavirus replication (17). The A deletion at position 2 immediately follows the core sequences (CUAAAC) of the PEDV leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which may slightly change the efficiency of base pairing of the nascent minus-strand sgRNAs with the positive-strand leader TRS in the discontinuous transcription (19, 20). SL4 functions as a spacer element in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) to direct sgRNA synthesis (18). A minor change (a 4-nt deletion at position 3) in the stem helix of SL4 might not disturb the spacer role of this structure. However, whether the three changes could collectively alter the efficiency of viral replication and sgRNA synthesis in the emergent U.S. PEDV strains, leading to enhanced pathogenicity, is an important subject for further investigation. The identification of identical unique nucleotide changes of the U.S. PEDV strains and BtCoV/512/2005 is also intriguing. It is possible that the emergent U.S. PEDV and BtCoV/512/2005 strains may have a convergent sequence evolution in this region, although it cannot be ruled out that the newly emergent PEDV strains acquired this segment by recombination from a BtCoV/512/2005-related coronavirus through cross-species transmission. It has never been established whether PEDV represents a genuine swine virus, although it is believed that all the alphacoronaviruses evolutionally originate from the bat species (3). In fact, an early report had described a PEDV-like virus in minks (21), although further independent verification is needed.",

Although the JS2008 and SD-M strains were claimed to be isolated from infected pigs (SD-M was only passaged on cells for 4 times) (22, 23), we found that both of them had the same characteristic amino acid deletions in the acidic domain of nsp3 (GLPVAPET) and in the C terminus of ORF3 as the other three cell-adapted strains (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), suggesting that these two strains were probably isolated from pigs vaccinated with the PEDV attenuated DR13 vaccine or a related vaccine. Therefore, all PEDV strains in subgroup 1b are likely derived from the same source, although some were isolated (SD-M in 2012) or developed as an attenuated vaccine (KC189944 in 2012) after the PED outbreaks in China in late 2010. The 8-aa deletion in nsp3 and the large ORF3 deletion at the C terminus can be used as a genetic signature for this subgroup. The third cluster in G1 consists of the virulent DR13 strain isolated in South Korea and the oldest Chinese PEDV strain, CH/S. We tentatively proposed this cluster as subgroup R, since they may represent recombinants of the other genogroups based upon the phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, these two strains showed a combination VISTA profile compared to the other subgroup strains (see Fig. S2), indicating that this subgroup likely contributed to the diversity of new PEDV strains during the evolution of PEDV by potential recombination events.",

With the exception of the three emergent U.S. strains, all of the other PEDV strains in G2 were isolated in China during 2011 to 2012. The U.S. strains and a Chinese strain, AH2012, share several unique nucleotides, as described above, and are also clustered together in a separate clade within subgroup 2a, suggesting that AH2012 or a closely related strain may be the origin of the PEDV emergence in the United States. Strains MN and IA2 had 99.6% and strain IA1 had 99.5% nucleotide identity with AH2012, respectively. While preparing the manuscript, the sequences of three additional U.S. PEDV strains (CO/13, IA2013, and IN2013) were reported online without in-depth analyses (24, 25). These 3 additional strains were reported to have 99.5% identities with the AH2012 strain. Therefore, the U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence and have been further classified into two sublineages: MN-IA2 and IA1-CO/13 (or possible IA1-CO/13-IA2013-IN2013).",

These two landmarks should bracket the time at which the virus was transferred from Asia to the United States. The results dated the latest divergence of PEDV from China to United States to approximately 5 to 6 years ago and dated the first divergence of PEDV within the United States to about one and a half years ago. This estimation (between 5 and 6 to ~1.5 years from the present) is consistent with the actual time difference\u2014approximately 2 to 3 years\u2014of the PED outbreaks between China (late 2010) and the United States (late spring 2013).",

The Chinese AH2012 strain, which is most closely related to the emergent U.S. strains, was isolated in Anhui Province, which is located in the overlapping geographical region where G2a and G2b are circulating (Fig. 2B). The AH2012-like virus was possibly transmitted to the eastern China regions and then transported to the United States. To determine whether the AH2012-related PEDV (designated \u201clineage US-AH\u201d) could be identified in Zhejiang Province, an adjacent province to the east of Anhui Province, we performed sequencing and sequence analyses of the S genes of PEDV strains isolated since 2012 from different pig farms in Zhejiang Province (represented by the XS2012 strain; GenBank accession no. KF468755), and the results showed that the strains from Zhejiang Province were almost identical, belonging to subgroup 2a but forming a clade distinct from AH2012 and the three U.S. strains (data not shown), suggesting that the AH2012-related PEDV has probably not spread into this area in China.",
