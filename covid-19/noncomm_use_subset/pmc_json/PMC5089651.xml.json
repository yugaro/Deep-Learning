All biopsy samples were evaluated in a blinded fashion by a veterinary pathologist (TP). Cholangitis,3, 6 enteritis,4, 5, 36 and pancreatitis37 were diagnosed based on previously described histopathological criteria,4, 5, 6, 37 and severity was scored semi\u2010quantitatively on an ascending scale of 0\u20134. Scores were given on the basis of inflammatory cell accumulation, fibrosis, and epithelial lesions according to the following scale: 0: normal; 1: mild; 2: mild to moderate; 3: moderate; and 4: severe. The highest among the separate scores given to each part of the intestine was considered as the enteritis score. Examples of the grading system of cholangitis, pancreatitis, and enteritis are shown in Figs 1, 2, 3. A cholangitis score of 4, corresponding to portal\u2010to\u2010portal bridging lesions, was not assigned to any of the cats examined and thus is not illustrated in Fig. 1.

Histopathological evidence of inflammation in 1, 2, or all 3 organs was present in 27/39 (69.2%; 95% CI: 56.4\u201379.5%) of symptomatic cats. Triaditis was present in 8/27 ([29.6%]; 95% CI: 14.8\u201348.1%) cases and the combination of IBD with either cholangitis (6/27) or pancreatitis (2/27) in 8/27 ([29.6%]; 95% CI: 14.8\u201348.1%) cats. Furthermore, our study identified evidence of inflammation in a high proportion of asymptomatic cats. Histopathological lesions of either cholangitis or enteritis alone, or combinations of inflammatory infiltration in 2 of the 3 organs were identified in the absence of clinical signs in 20/39 ([51.3%]; 95% CI: 38.5\u201364.1%) cats. The combination of IBD and cholangitis (10/20) or pancreatitis (1 case) was present in 11/20 ([55%]; 95% CI: 35\u201375%) asymptomatic cats. These findings suggest that IBD and combinations of inflammatory diseases of 2 organs begin before the onset of clinical signs or that in some cases clinical signs are so mild and transient that are missed by the owner. Furthermore, in our study pancreatitis alone or triaditis was only present in cats that were symptomatic. Also, the combination of cholangitis and pancreatitis without concurrent lesions of IBD was not detected. In addition, the histological severity of IBD lesions was positively correlated with the number of comorbidities.

Furthermore, focal inflammatory lesions of pancreatitis might escape diagnosis.37, 59 Serum total lipase activity60, 61, 62 and serum fTLI63, 64, 65, 66 are not considered sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic disease in cats, and this was confirmed in our study for the fTLI test. Concerning serum total lipase activity, although a mild positive correlation was detected between median activity of this test and the severity score of pancreatitis, the difference between the controls and the triaditis group was not statistically significant. Feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI, as measured by Spec fPL\u00ae) is an assay that specifically quantifies lipase that originates from pancreatic acinar cells.32, 34 The fPLI's overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of pancreatitis has been estimated to be 67% (ranging from 54% in mild cases to 100% in moderate\u2010to\u2010severe cases of pancreatitis) and its specificity has reached 100% in healthy cats and 91% in cats with gastrointestinal disease without histopathological lesions in the pancreas.62, 64, 65, 66 In a recent study of naturally occurring pancreatitis, the sensitivity of the method was reported to be 78%.13 As shown in our study, median fPLI in cats with triaditis was significantly higher when compared with the control group, although the median score of pancreatitis recorded in the triaditis group was suggestive of mild\u2010to\u2010moderate pancreatitis and the median fPLI did not exceed the upper limit of the reference interval (3.5 \u03bcg/L). Moreover, a statistically significant increase in the median value of the variable also was observed in group Ch, compared with controls and all of the other groups of cats. One possible explanation is that a number of cats from group Ch might have had localized pancreatitis that was missed on histopathology (because only a single biopsy specimen was evaluated for the purpose of our study). Consequently, additional studies involving larger numbers of cats with triaditis and of variable severity pancreatitis are needed. Several pancreatic biopsy specimens should be collected and evaluated, and serum fPLI must be considered along with other clinical and laboratory findings to maximize the diagnostic capabilities for pancreatitis and triaditis.",

No statistically significant differences in the severity of histopathological lesions of either a single organ or a combination of several organs were identified between symptomatic and asymptomatic cats. The histopathological lesions of IBD in cats with triaditis were significantly more severe than in cats where IBD lesions were present alone, suggesting that IBD might play a role in the development of triaditis. Further research is essential to better understand the complex interactions among inflammation in these organs and thus improve our diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.",
