Owing to a recent diagnosis of cutaneous leprosy in a different cat from the same household, the lesion from the scapula was surgically excised for histopathological examination and imprint smears from one of the forelimb lesions were made for cytological examination. The latter revealed high numbers of macrophages, with an epithelioid appearance and occasional giant multinucleated macrophages, as well as low numbers of plasma cells and small lymphocytes. Numerous organisms consistent with Leishmania species amastigotes were noted in parasitophorous vacuoles of the macrophages and freely in the background (Figure 2a). Histopathological examination of the lesion (Figure 2b) revealed mild acanthosis and focal ulceration of the epidermis. Within the subjacent dermis, extending from the denuded surface to the deep dermis/panniculus, was an irregular, densely cellular area composed of macrophages, with low numbers of multinucleated forms. The macrophages contained numerous intracytoplasmic vacuoles (5\u20137 \u03bcm in diameter) within which were densely amphophilic round-to-oval organisms (approximately 1 \u03bcm diameter). The macrophages were mostly in random array; rarely groups of the cells were aggregated to form small granulomas. There were lighter admixtures of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The cytological and histopathological diagnosis was granulomatous dermatitis with intralesional intracytoplasmic amastigotes consistent with Leishmania species.",

The cat was PCR positive for Hepatozoon species using conventional PCR, as well as positive for Leishmania species and CMhm using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Subsequent sequencing identified H felis and L\ninfantum.3 Owing to the small size of the amplicon generated by the initial Leishmania species PCR4 an additional PCR was performed, targeting the rRNA ITS1 locus of L infantum,5 followed by sequencing. The forward and reverse sequences of the L infantum were assembled and constructed into a consensus sequence, which was deposited in the GenBank database (MF140257). The DNA sequence was 100% identical to a partial 18S rRNA ITS1 sequence of L infantum (GenBank KX664454) over 258 bp, as found by BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Phylogeny (Figure 3) showed the L infantum from this Cypriot cat to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, a sandfly in Iran and a human in France. The cat was PCR negative for Mycoplasma haemofelis, \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\u2019 (CMt), Bartonella henselae and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma species, and seronegative for feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies.",

However, the PCR results post-treatment showed that elimination of L infantum had not occurred, indicating progressive subclinical infection. Given the potential role of the cat as a secondary reservoir and the zoonotic nature of L infantum, an alternative treatment could have been implemented for this patient, such as a combination of allopurinol with meglumine antimoniate or N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate.",

Persichetti et al reported in a recent study that although ELISA serology was better for diagnosing clinical FeL compared with the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the latter was more sensitive than ELISA to detect subclinical infection.16 The same study also recommended Western blot as the preferable serological test for FeL since it yielded a higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to ELISA and IFAT.",
