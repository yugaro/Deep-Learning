Many pathogens thrive on extracellular nutrients available in the blood and mucosal surface and on the host cellular lysate. However, E. chaffeensis, as an obligatory intracellular bacterium, acquires nutrients inside host cells which are kept alive until bacteria fully proliferate and mature (reviewed in ref. 7). The host cell-dependency of E. chaffeensis is so extreme that unlike facultative intracellular bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can be cultured axenically, E. chaffeensis cannot replicate or even survive outside of host cells for more than a few hours. The intracellular membrane compartment (inclusion) that contains E. chaffeensis has early endosome\u2013like characteristics, including the small GTPase RAB5, a RAB5 effector EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1), TF (transferrin), TFRC (transferrin receptor), and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, but it lacks late endosomal or lysosomal markers or NADPH oxidase components.8-10 Within this compartment, E. chaffeensis acquires all nutrients for its reproduction to form numerous mature infectious forms. E. chaffeensis has a small genome of 1.176 Mb with a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism.11 Consequently it must depend mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for replication. Although the host cell cytoplasm is rich with these nutrients, it is unlikely that the inclusion membrane is leaky, as ehrlichial inclusions maintain a weakly acidic intralumenal pH.8 It is also unlikely that varieties of active transporters are synthesized and assembled in the proper orientation on the inclusion membrane to import host nutrients during ehrlichial replication. Considering these limitations, it is possible that a novel mechanism has evolved in this group of obligatory intracellular bacteria to acquire nutrients.",

A number of ATG (autophagy-related) proteins regulate autophagosome biogenesis and maturation (reviewed in refs. 15, 16). In the canonical amino acid starvation-induced pathway in mammalian cells, autophagosome formation is induced by activation of class III PtdIns3K, and an essential component of the PtdIns3K complex, BECN1 (Beclin 1; mammalian ortholog of yeast Vps30/Atg6).17 ATG12, a ubiquitin-like protein that covalently modifies ATG5, and MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; a mammalian ortholog family of yeast Atg8) are involved in elongation and expansion of autophagosomes.18,19 Biochemical and morphological studies have shown that autophagosomes can fuse with early or late endosomes, forming the amphisome, a hybrid organelle,20-24 although detailed mechanisms of these processes remain, for the most part, unknown. Autophagosomes or amphisomes subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where captured substrates are degraded and catabolites are released to the cytosol.15,25,26",

Western blot analysis was used to compare knocked-down host protein levels and E. chaffeensis major outer membrane protein P2852 levels relative to controls. All these methods are comparable in quantifying bacteria.53,54 3-MA addition at 0 h did not inhibit E. chaffeensis entry as determined at 2 h p.i. (Fig. 2A). However, when 3-MA was added at 1 h p.i. (immediately after ehrlichial entry) or at 1 d p.i. (at the beginning of exponential growth) and the infected THP-1 cells were continuously incubated in the presence of 3-MA, infection\u2014based on both the percent of infected cells and bacterial numbers per host cell\u2014was greatly inhibited compared with untreated infected cells (Fig. 2B and C). When 3-MA was added to infected cells at 23 h p.i. and incubated for 6 h or 58 h, E. chaffeensis became condensed and were marginalized in enlarged vacuoles (Fig. 2D, panels iv and vi), which was confirmed by staining with an antibody against E. chaffeensis P2852 (Fig. 2E). The vacuoles found in infected cells after 3-MA treatment were specific to E. chaffeensis infection, because similar vacuoles were not seen in uninfected THP-1 cells after 3-MA treatment for 2 d (Fig. S2A). 3-MA did not have direct toxicity on E. chaffeensis: when E. chaffeensis was pretreated with 3-MA and then incubated with THP-1 cells in the absence of 3-MA, there was no inhibitory effect on its ability to infect the cells (Fig. S2B). 3-MA did not have direct toxicity on host mammalian cells, as treatment with 2 mM 3-MA for 1 d had no effect on THP-1 cell viability (Fig. S2A, Table S1). 3-MA does not seem to block intracellular bacterial infection nonspecifically by impairing host cell metabolism, because 3-MA treatment enhances intracellular Mycobacterium growth inside macrophages.31 In addition, 3-MA treatment did not induce lysosomal fusion with ehrlichial inclusions as indicated by an absence of LAMP1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) colocalization (Fig. S3). The inhibition by 3-MA was reversible, as the inclusions were filled with replicating ehrlichiae at 52 h after 3-MA withdrawal (Fig. 2D, panel v).\n\n",

First, we used a siRNA (small interfering RNA) to reduce BECN1 expression in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, which are readily transfected and infected with E. chaffeensis.54\nE. chaffeensis proliferation was significantly reduced in BECN1 siRNA\u2013transfected cells compared with cells transfected with the control scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3A). Next, we treated infected THP-1 cells with a cell-permeable potent autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1.58 Spautin-1 promotes the degradation of BECN1 by inhibiting 2 USPs (ubiquitin-specific peptidases), USP10 and USP13, which target BECN1.58 Spautin-1 treatment of infected cells significantly decreased E. chaffeensis proliferation (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that both class III PtdIns3K activation and BECN1 are required for E. chaffeensis replication, implying that autophagy induction by class III PtdIns3K complex is required for E. chaffeensis replication.\n\n",

LC3, also called LC3-I (cytosolic form), becomes conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (termed LC3-II) and localizes on autophagosomal membranes (appearing as small puncta by fluorescence microscopy) when autophagy is induced.19 Thus LC3-II serves as a marker for canonical autophagosomes. ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugation is required for the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II,61 and A. phagocytophilum inclusions are heavily encased by LC3-II.35,37 However, GFP-LC3, as well as endogenous LC3B, did not encase individual E. chaffeensis inclusions (Fig. 4C and S5B). In contrast, both GFP-LC3 and endogenous LC3B were observed as puncta in E. chaffeensis-infected RF/6A cells at 2 to 3 d p.i. (Fig. 4C and S5B). The conversion from LC3B-I to LC3B-II did not increase during exponential E. chaffeensis proliferation but was evident at 3 d p.i. in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (Fig. 4D) when infected cells began to rupture because of the heavy bacterial burden, as shown by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the late onset of LC3B-II conversion may be caused by canonical autophagy: nutritional and ATP depletion that is due to overwhelming ehrlichial replication. Because treatment of E. chaffeensis-infected cells at 2 d p.i. with 10 nM bafilomycin A1 (BAF) for 6 h significantly increased the ratio of endogenous LC3B-II to LC3B-I (Fig. S6A), the basal autophagy flux was not blocked during the exponential growth phase (2 d p.i.) of intracellular E. chaffeensis. In addition, LC3B knockdown with siRNA did not reduce E. chaffeensis infection at 2 d p.i. (Fig. 4E). Thus ATG5 autophagosome localization to E. chaffeensis inclusions was not followed by the LC3B-II localization, a process that is distinct from the development of GFP-LC3-II-loaded autophagosomes routed to A. phagocytophilum inclusions.35,37",

In contrast, the intrainclusion ehrlichial protein VirB6-240 was not labeled with anti-VirB6-2 in SLO-treated cells (Fig. 6B), indicating the inability of SLO to permeabilize E. chaffeensis inclusions. Saponin treatment permeabilizes all cholesterol-containing membranes. Both Etf-1 and VirB6-2 could be labeled with their respective antibodies and colocalized in saponin-permeabilized cells (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that native Etf-1 is present on the cytoplasmic face of inclusions. Furthermore, ectopically expressed Etf-1-GFP at 2 d p.i. was recruited to E. chaffeensis inclusions, and Etf-1-GFP could be observed inside bacteria-containing inclusions (56.8 \u00b1 4.8% of E. chaffeensis inclusions as quantitated from 10 to 20 cells each in 3 independent experiments, Fig. 6C). Similarly, immunogold labeling showed Etf-1-GFP on the E. chaffeensis inclusion membranes or inside inclusions (Fig. 6D). Etf-1 targeting to bacteria-containing inclusions was specific to E. chaffeensis, as Etf-1-GFP was not present on A. phagocytophilum inclusions (Fig. S8B).",

There are 3 RAB5 isoforms expressed in human cells, namely RAB5A, 5B, and 5C, which share similar subcellular localization and regulatory functions in the early endocytic pathway.98 RAB5 isoforms are at least partially redundant because downregulation of expression of any single RAB5 isoform using siRNA has no effect on EGF or transferrin internalization, but downregulation of all 3 isoforms has a significant effect.99 Similarly, silencing of all 3 RAB5 isoforms is required to block AKT activation after insulin treatment.100 With this in mind, we tested the role of RAB5 in E. chaffeensis infection by silencing expression of all 3 RAB5 isoforms using siRNA. Western blotting results showed that E. chaffeensis infection was significantly reduced by RAB5 knockdown compared with the control scrambled-siRNA transfection (Fig. 9A). Next, we examined whether exogenous RAB5 traffics to already established E. chaffeensis inclusions by transfecting GFP-RAB5. All 3 GFP-RAB5 isoforms produced puncta (vesicles) and accumulated on E. chaffeensis inclusions when transfected at 15 h p.i., and quantitation from 10 to 20 cells each in 4 independent experiments showed RAB5A positive E. chaffeensis inclusions were 94.0 \u00b1 5.5%. RAB5 delivery appeared to occur largely via fusion of the E. chaffeensis inclusions with RAB5-containing vesicles, suggesting the recruitment and retention of RAB5 endosomes during E. chaffeensis replication and expansion of the inclusion (Fig. 9B to D). In uninfected cells, GFP-RAB5 showed smaller diffuse puncta than in infected cells (RAB5A shown in Fig. 9E).\n\n",

Ehrlichial infection significantly increases cellular PtdIns3P levels at early stage of infection, and dramatic inhibition of ehrlichial growth results from the inhibition of autophagy induction by 3-MA or spautin-1 treatment, or knockdown of ATG5 or BECN1. The inhibition is not due to reduced viability of the host cells, or due to direct toxicity to bacteria. Conversely autophagy induction by rapamycin enhanced infection. How does host cellular autophagy facilitate ehrlichial proliferation? Gln is a primary energy and carbon source of E. chaffeensis that cannot utilize glucose.53 The present study implies that autophagy supplies Gln for E. chaffeensis, because it acquires host preincorporated Gln in a class III PtdIns3K activity\u2013dependent manner, and growth inhibition by autophagy inhibition was reversed by excess amino acid supplementation. Moreover, free Gln and Glu, which are the primary amino acids generated by the autophagic degradation of eukaryotic cytoplasm,108 are also the primary amino acids that increased during exponential E. chaffeensis growth (Table 1).",

Consequently several intracellular pathogens prevent or delay the RAB5 to RAB7 transition. For example, M. tuberculosis localizes in the RAB5-positive endocytic compartment by reducing PtdIns3P in the phagosomal membrane, thereby interfering with phagosome maturation.109,110\nListeria monocytogenes GAPDH binds and carries out ADP-ribosylation of RAB5A and impairs the GDP/GTP exchange and thereby blocks phagosome maturation.111 Maturation arrest of RAB5-positive E. chaffeensis inclusions is distinct from these examples, as PtdIns3P is highly enriched and the blockade seems to be due to RAB5 GTPase inactivation, based on the ability of SGSM3 overexpression to overcome the blockade. In agreement with this observation, the stable presence of the RAB5 effectors EEA1, PIK3C3, and ANKFY1 on E. chaffeensis\u2013containing inclusions and the inhibition of E. chaffeensis infection by overexpression of RAB5-DN or SGSM3 suggest that RAB5 is mostly locked in the GTP-bound state on E. chaffeensis inclusions.",

Indeed, several previous studies point to the critical role of RAB5-GTP in early autophagosome development/maturation. 1) Ectopic expression of dominant-negative RAB5 or 3-MA treatment blocks the progression of early ATG5-positive phagophores to form LC3-positive autophagosomes.97 2) Upon growth factor restriction, the class 1A phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic subunit \u03b2 (PIK3CB/p110\u03b2) dissociates from the growth factor receptor and binds RAB5.95 Such interaction blocks the RAB5 GTPase-activating protein PIK3R1/p85\u03b1 (class 1A phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1) from binding to RAB5, which consequently increases the amount of GTP-bound RAB5 and enhances the RAB5-PIK3C3 interaction to promote autophagy.95 3) Hepatitis C virus NS4B protein forms a complex with RAB5 and PIK3C3 and induces RAB5-GTP-promoted autophagy, which is required for virus replication.96 4) HTT binds RAB5 via the RAB5 effector F8A1/HAP40 (coagulation factor VIII-associated 1), and degradated by autophagy.112 Similar to E. chaffeensis infection, such RAB5-regulated autophagy is independent from MTOR signaling.95,97",

It is still unclear how host cytoplasmic molecules enter into ehrlichial inclusions. Unlike most other intracellular bacteria that are killed by autophagy, E. chaffeensis inclusions lack ubiquitination, LC3, and late endosome or lysosomal markers, although they do contain ATG5, PIK3C3, PtdIns3P, and RAB5. Although the classical view has been that autophagic and endocytic pathways converge at the phagolysosomal and lysosomal levels, autophagosomes have also been found to undergo fusion with earlier components of the endocytic pathway.21,22,24,113 The presence of ATG5 suggests that E. chaffeensis inclusions are large amphisomes, and Etf-1-, RAB5-, and ATG5-containing small vesicles might also be considered amphisomes. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs), morphologically distinctive endosomes, internally accumulate small membrane vesicles (60 to 80 nm), which contain cytosolic cargo molecules.21,114 Morphological evidence suggests that MVBs are the main endocytic fusion partner of the autophagosome, forming the amphisome.21,115 It is tempting to speculate that fusion of these vesicles with ehrlichial inclusions or invagination of the ehrlichial inclusion membrane would deliver host cytosolic cargo into the inclusion lumen. PIK3C3 and PtdIns3P are essential for the generation of the internal vesicles of MVBs, and RAB5 promotes the formation of PtdIns3P on endosomes116 and phagosomes.117 Most 2\u00d7FYVE labeling is associated with the internal membranes of MVBs, which have low levels of the late endosome and lysosome markers like lysosomal membrane glycoproteins and lyso-bisphosphatidic acid.44,118 PtdIns3P accumulates within ECVs (endosomal carrier vesicles) and MVBs, and PtdIns3P signaling regulates receptor sorting into ECVs/MVBs.44,119 Indeed, our results with 2\u00d7FYVE-GFP-transfected cells also showed strong intralumenal PtdIns3P in large vesicles docked onto E. chaffeensis inclusions, suggesting that these vesicles are MVBs (Fig. 1A, arrow). Inhibition of PtdIns3K blocks formation of intralumenal vesicles in MVBs, which results in swollen vesicles.120 Reversible vacuolation of ehrlichial inclusions in 3-MA-treated cells (Fig. 2D, 2E, and S2) suggests the inclusions also have the feature of MVBs.",

Although this is similar to A. phagocytophilum Ats-1-induced autophagy,37 there are clear differences between the 2 bacteria: 1) RAB5 is involved in E. chaffeensis-induced autophagy, but not in A. phagocytophilum-induced autophagy; 2) Etf-1 and Ats-1 promote distinct autophagy nucleation complexes derived from early endosomes and ER, respectively; 3) E. chaffeensis inclusions appear as early amphisomes without LC3-II localization, whereas A. phagocytophilum inclusions are early autophagosomes with distinct LC3-II localization;37 and 4) Etf-1 and Ats-1, despite their 21% amino acid sequence identity, selectively target and promote E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum growth,37 respectively.

(A) HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Etf-1-HA and GFP (CTL) or GFP-RAB5A (WT, DN, or CA mutant). At 2 d p.t., samples were lysed and immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-HA cross-linked on protein G-sepharose beads for 2 h. Images were representative of 3 experiments with similar results. (B) RF/6A cells cotransfected with Etf-1-DsRed and GFP-RAB5A-CA for 2 d. White arrows indicate the colocalization between the 2 proteins. The boxed area was enlarged 4-fold. Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm. (C) HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP, GFP-RAB5 (WT, DN, or CA mutant), SGSM3/RABGAP5 (WT), or SGSM3R165A mutant (RA) and then infected with E. chaffeensis at 1 d p.t. for 2 d. Samples were examined by western blotting, and the ratios of P28: ACT/actin were quantified and compared with those of RAB5 WT or SGSM3R165A groups, which were arbitrarily set as 1. Images were representative of 3 experiments with similar results.",
