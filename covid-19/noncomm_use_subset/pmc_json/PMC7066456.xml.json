            "text": "Since its inception more than 30 years ago, the baculovirus expression system (BES) has been widely employed for recombinant protein expression at massive levels (van Oers, Pijlman, & Vlak, 2015; Smith, Summers, & Fraser, 1983). Depending on posttranslational modifications in insect cells and larvae, the BES is markedly suitable for eukaryotic protein expression (Kidd & Emery, 1993). In recent years, multigene expression employing the BES has been reported (Berger, Fitzgerald, & Richmond, 2004; Kanai, Athmaram, Stewart, & Roy, 2013; Yao et al., 2012). Multigene expression in a single recombinant baculovirus has advantages in expression applications. The expression of double\u2010chain antibodies and packaging of recombinant adeno\u2010associated virus (rAAV) are a few examples of this expression system (Furuta, Ogawa, Katsuda, Fujii, & Yamaji, 2010; Negrete, Yang, Mendez, Levy, & Kotin, 2007).",

Compared with the AcMNPV\u2010cell expression system, the BmNPV\u2010silkworm system possesses better posttranslational processing and greater expression efficiency (Dojima et al., 2009; Usami et al., 2011).

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) were first discovered in the 1950s, and since then, they have been researched deeply in many fields. Interferons are categorized into three major classes. Type I IFNs are generated by almost any type of cell in response to invading pathogens (Alsharifi, Mullbacher, & Regner, 2008). They can induce the expression of specific antiviral proteins and related physiological responses by binding with specific receptors on the cell membrane (Levy, Marie, & Durbin, 2011). Type II IFNs possess strong immune regulation ability and can regulate the activity of lymphocytes (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005). Type III IFNs have been recently discovered. They have functions similar to those of type I IFNs (Kotenko, 2011; Sheppard et al., 2003). Some studies indicate that type I and II IFNs demonstrate synergy in the establishment of an antiviral state (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005; Sekellick, Lowenthal, O'Neil, & Marcus, 1998).",

Chicken IFN\u2010\u03b3 (chIFN\u2010\u03b3) is a type II IFN. It demonstrates avian virus inhibition both in vitro and in vivo and has the capability to prevent poultry coccidiosis (Cardenas\u2010Garcia et al., 2016; Khatri & Sharma, 2008; Shah et al., 2010). Studies also illustrate that chIFN\u2010\u03b3 enhances the growth performance of reared broilers (Lowenthal, 2001). These two IFNs have an immune synergism effect. The combination of chIFN\u2010\u03b1 and chIFN\u2010\u03b3 can significantly enhance viral inhibition and elicit an antiviral state (Plachy et al., 1999; Sekellick et al., 1998).",

            "text": "In the present study, the coexpression of type I and II IFNs at different gene sites was successfully achieved using a single recombinant baculovirus. The type I IFN chIFN\u2010\u03b1 gene was introduced at the polyhedron gene site. The chIFN\u2010\u03b3 gene, a type II IFN\u2010encoding gene, was inserted at the p10 gene site. The antiviral potential of the coexpression product was five to ten times higher than that of any single\u2010expression product. After heat and acid treatment, the remaining IFN\u2010\u03b1 antiviral activity of the coexpression product was approximately two times greater than that of the chIFN\u2010\u03b1 single\u2010expression product. This finding indicates that the expression level of IFN\u2010\u03b1 in the reBm\u2010C\u03b1\u03b3 product was significantly higher than that in the reBm\u2010C\u03b1 product. ELISA results further augmented that multi\u2010IFN expression in the coexpression product was higher than that in the single\u2010expression product. This result was consistent with the antiviral assay. The increase in expression level is due to deletion of the p10 gene. Just like polyhedrin gene, p10 is a nonessential gene for baculovirus replication and budded virus production. And also, it is nonessential for recombinant protein expression, but with high expression level (Hitchman et al., 2010). In recombinant baculovirus, polyhedrin promoter is the preference for foreign gene expression. The polyhedrin gene is replaced by a foreign gene. The saved cost of polyhedrin expression provides for the recombinant protein expression. In reBm\u2010C\u03b1\u03b3, the deletion of p10 gene can also save a certain degree of cost of gene expression, even though the p10 promoter is weaker than the polyhedrin promoter. And these saving costs could be used for foreign gene expression. Thus, in reBm\u2010C\u03b1\u03b3, the deletion of p10 gene enhances the chIFN\u2010\u03b1 expression which driven by polyhedrin promoter, indirectly. This finding also provides an optimal direction for enhanced expression levels. However, the antiviral assay against VSV and MDV showed that the antiviral potential of the coexpression product was more than two times greater than that of any single\u2010expression product. This difference must be due to the synergistic effect of the two types of IFN. Type I and II IFNs display diverse antiviral mechanisms. Here, coadministration of these two IFNs exhibited synergistic effects and elevated antiviral potential. Hence, the coexpression of the two IFNs by employing the BES is significant and beneficial. The coexpression products displayed greater antiviral activity and synergistic effects than the single\u2010expression products. This strategy of combined administration of chicken IFNs can suppress viral diseases in the poultry industry.",

There was no fundamental sequence or antibiotic resistance gene residue in the target gene site of the baculoviral genome. By employing this method, multiple gene insertion into various gene sites in one recombinant baculovirus can be achieved easily. This multigene baculovirus expression system can be a potential tool in many research fields. The BES is advantageous for antibody expression (Verma, Boleti, & George, 1998). Previously, heavy\u2010 and light\u2010chain genes were inserted in the same gene site (Furuta et al., 2010). Using the multigene expression strategy in the present study, heavy\u2010 and light\u2010chain genes can be introduced into different sites in one recombinant baculovirus, and enhanced expression levels will be achieved. rAAV packaging is another application area of the BES. In preceding studies, rAAV packaging required two or three recombinant baculoviruses, which individually contained cap, rep, and target genes (Aslanidi, Lamb, & Zolotukhin, 2009; Negrete et al., 2007). By employing our multigene expression strategy, rep, cap, and target genes can be inserted separately into the same recombinant baculovirus at the egt, p10, and polyhedron gene sites, respectively. The packaging efficiency of rAAV would thus be greater than that when using two or three recombinant baculoviruses (Galibert & Merten, 2011).",
