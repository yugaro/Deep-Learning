Given the public health risk posed by epidemics and pandemics, it is critical to systematically assess global preparedness, and to identify regions that are not well equipped to respond to such threats to public health.",

There is clear evidence that the scale and severity of the 2013\u20132016 West Africa Ebola epidemic was exacerbated by the weak state of health systems in West Africa, and in particular, limited local capacity for public health surveillance and outbreak response.6\n",

They are also the primary locus of capacity-building efforts aimed at improving preparedness. Improving global capacity to respond to infectious disease crises requires better data on national-level preparedness worldwide, in order to inform and calibrate both foreign and domestic investments in capacity.7 Existing frameworks for measuring preparedness, including WHO\u2019s IHR Core Capacity Monitoring Framework and the JEE, have substantially improved our understanding of preparedness to mitigate global health threats, and have shed light on gaps in preparedness both by function and across geographies. However, these frameworks have two limitations. First, while both focus on public health competencies in great depth, they do not fully address the broader range of non-health system factors, including institutional, financial and infrastructural capacities, which are also fundamental building blocks for effective response to infectious disease epidemics. For example, the JEE includes an indicator for \u2018Linking Public Health and Security Authorities\u2019, which is important for assessing the coordination between these institutions. However, this indicator does not measure the capacity of the security authorities to perform their required functions. Given the importance of this and other enabling functions, metrics tracking these additional capacities should be incorporated into assessments of epidemic preparedness.",

Once an epidemic is underway, the healthcare and public health systems must be able to identify, investigate, monitor and manage abrupt surges in cases through the mobilisation of personnel and resources. Health systems must be able to manage the clinical care for infected persons, and limit further transmission in clinical facilities, and public health agencies must also be able to implement effective non-pharmaceutical measures to limit the spread of infection.11 Lastly, the health system must be able to coordinate activity with other national and international agencies.",

Communications infrastructure is similarly important, and the growing availability of mobile phones and internet-based reporting tools can support outbreak and diagnostic reporting, particularly where traditional surveillance systems are weak or porous.13 Other elements of critical infrastructure, notably improved water sources, are essential elements supporting the overall functionality of the health system: critical for the provision of clinical care as well as the maintenance of sanitary standards.",

Institutional capacity is difficult and often slow to develop,14 but can be rapidly degraded by political instability and violence. Vital health systems, including surveillance, information systems, clinical referral and care, and supply chains are vulnerable to disruption by political instability, insecurity and armed conflict.15 As such, countries with stable institutional structures and security conditions will perform better in detecting and responding to outbreaks than countries with political volatility, weak public administration systems and active conflict or insecurity.",
