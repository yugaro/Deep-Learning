            "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of idiopathic, chronic gastrointestinal\ntract disorders characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract by inflammatory\ncells that are generally confined to the mucosa, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells,\nneutrophils and eosinophils [6]. IBD is a common disease\ncharacterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and weight\nloss, in certain animal species and humans [6, 7]. Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is part of the IBD complex\nand is a morphological diagnosis characterized by inflammation in which eosinophilic\nleucocytes predominate [1], with clinical signs typified\nby chronic obstinate diarrhea. It is a minor cause of IBD in humans [6, 11], dogs [10], cats [4, 5] and horses [1, 8, 9]; however, few\ncases of EOE in cattle have been reported [2]. This\nresearch group previously reported 4 cases of idiopathic EOE in cattle, aged 1 (Angus heifer),\n5 (Simmental bull), 7 (Holstein cow) and 11 (Holstein cow) years old, diagnosed on the basis\nof clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other differential diagnoses for\ncattle with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither\nthe occurrence of EOE in Japanese Black (JB) cattle nor the associated clinical symptoms from\nthe first appearance of their symptoms after purchase or birth to completion of their\nfattening periods (approximately 30 months of age) have been reported thus\nfar.",

Eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia and\nhyperglobulinemia have been suggested as useful parameters in the diagnosis of EOE based on\nhematological and biochemical examination results [3,\n7, 9].\nAdditionally, it has been suggested that there is a strong relationship between the clinical\nand biochemical findings and the degree of eosinophilic infiltration of intestinal layers in\nEOE-affected animals [7]. In the present study, the\nresults of hematological and serum biochemical examinations in our 3 cattle cases were within\nnormal ranges, which was in agreement with a previous report in cattle by Cebra et\nal. [2]. Although the reasons for the\ndiscrepancies between the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations and the\nchronic symptoms exhibited by the affected cattle are obscure, this finding suggests the\npossible pathophysiology in EOE-affected cattle. Additionally, histopathological examination\nof the intestinal tissues from the 3 animals indicated marked infiltration of eosinophils,\nlymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa, with occasional extension of\nthe infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the submucosa or muscular layer of the\njejunum, ileum and large intestine, which might be in line with the previous report by Cebra\net al. [2]. However, the clinical\nsymptoms of our patients differed from those in the report by Cebra et al.\n[2] regarding 2 parameters: (1) maintenance of good\ngrowth rates and (2) excretion of carneous tissue. Cebra et al. [2] suggested that there is a wide spectrum of clinical\nsymptoms in EOE in cattle; this might explain these differences. Cebra et al.\n[2] diagnosed EOE in 2 out of 4 affected cattle during\nthe antemortem period by examining excisional biopsy samples obtained during exploratory\nlaparotomy via a right-flank incision, and administration of corticosteroids was initiated on\nthe basis of an objective diagnosis. Allowing for evidence-based medicine and animal-welfare\nissues in cattle with chronic illness, endoscopic observation and biopsy of the large\nintestine after a preliminary diagnosis of EOE has been made may enable timely confirmation\nand appropriate treatment of EOE in JB cattle.",
