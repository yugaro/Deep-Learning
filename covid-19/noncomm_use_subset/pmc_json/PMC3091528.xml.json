            "text": "LSECtin is one of a group of glycan-binding receptors encoded near the end of human chromosome 19 (Liu et al. 2004). Other receptors in the cluster include the dendritic and endothelial cell receptors dendritic cell-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN related receptor (DC-SIGNR) (L-SIGN) and the structurally related Fc-binding receptor CD23 (Soilleux et al. 2000). All of these receptors contain C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). Although a related cluster is found in the syntenic region of chromosome 8 in mouse, there are major differences in the organization of several of the genes, with eight mouse DC-SIGN-related genes replacing the two human genes (Powlesland et al. 2006). These differences make it difficult to identify clear mouse-human orthologs. In contrast, the human and mouse LSECtin genes appear to be much more closely related, although the two sequences differ at key residues that have been proposed to be involved in selective binding of ligands (Powlesland et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2009).",

Unlike many glycan-binding receptors, LSECtin does not appear to function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Gramberg et al. 2008; Powlesland et al. 2008), although it can undergo antibody-induced internalization in myeloid cells (Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. 2007). Several biological functions for LSECtin mediated by its ability to interact with specific glycans have been investigated. In vitro studies demonstrate that human LSECtin can provide a route for Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus infection of cells initiated by binding of LSECtin to glycans of the viral envelope glycoproteins (Gramberg et al. 2005; Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. 2007; Powlesland et al. 2008). Studies in mice indicate that mouse LSECtin is able to bind T cells through glycans on the CD44 T-cell surface marker (Tang et al. 2010). This interaction leads to suppression of T-cell responses and knockout mice lacking LSECtin show increased sensitivity to liver damage mediated by T cells following acute injury, suggesting that LSECtin plays a role in protection of the liver from immune attack (Tang et al. 2009). Finally, it has been suggested that receptor expressed on myeloid cells could be involved in antigen capture and presentation (Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. 2007).",

Expression was detected exclusively in the liver, as was previously observed for human LSECtin in a survey of a similar set of human tissues (Liu et al. 2004). This distribution is consistent with the idea that mouse LSECtin performs a function similar to human LSECtin in sinusoidal endothelial cells, although it was not possible to document expression in lymph node as well because of the difficulty of obtaining a suitable cDNA library.\n",

The signal sequence allows folding of the CRD in the periplasm, so the protein could be extracted and purified directly by affinity chromatography on immobilized sugars (data not shown). However, for the mouse CRD, more efficient expression was obtained by production of the CRD as inclusion bodies that were dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride and renatured by dilution and dialysis (Figure 1C). Similar yields were obtained by purification on either fucose- or mannose-Sepharose. However, due to the relatively weak affinity of individual CRDs for the monosaccharide ligands, a 10-mL column was required to achieve effective purification. The CRD was used directly in the solid-phase binding assays.",

Previous modeling studies led to the hypothesis that an important contribution to high affinity binding of terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man residues might be interaction of the N-acetyl group with the side chain of residue Trp259 (Powlesland et al. 2008). Surprisingly, this residue was found to be substituted by arginine in the mouse protein (Figure 4A). The similarity of the ligand-binding activities of the human and mouse proteins does not support the hypothesis that interactions of the aromatic side chain are important. The role of this residue was tested directly by creating mutant versions of the human CRD in which Trp259 is substituted with arginine, as found in the mouse protein, or with alanine. Comparison of binding of the wild-type and mutant proteins to the exposed terminal GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man disaccharides of Ebola virus glycoprotein confirmed that the absence of the tryptophan side chain does not significantly affect the interaction (Figure 4B).\n",

The difference in the evolutionary history of these two protein families, in spite of their proximity in mammalian genomes, indicates that these proteins are subject to different evolutionary pressures. One interpretation of the conserved binding properties of LSECtin is that this receptor may bind a conserved endogenous glycan ligand, whereas DC-SIGN is evolving to interact with different pathogen glycans. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that DC-SIGN functions as an endocytic receptor able to a direct pathogen uptake and presentation to the immune system (Engering et al. 2002; Guo et al. 2004), whereas LSECtin does not have constitutive endocytic activity (Gramberg et al. 2008; Powlesland et al. 2008). In this scenario, the binding of endogenous ligands, such as CD44 on T cells, would be the primary function of LSECtin, which has been hijacked by certain pathogens such as Ebola virus.",

DC-SIGN is one of many receptors that show extreme divergence between human and mouse (Powlesland et al. 2006). The CD33 family of siglecs represent another example of independent radiation of a group of glycan-binding receptors (Crocker et al. 2007), and some receptors, such as the Kupffer cell receptor and prolectin, are present in rodents but not humans or vice versa (Fadden et al. 2003; Graham et al. 2009). Aside from the evolutionary and functional implications of the conservation of LSECtin function, the close similarities in their ligand-binding properties, as well as the similar restricted distribution of tissues in which they are expressed, provide a firm foundation for use of mouse LSECtin as a model for the human receptor, which is not always possible in the case of more divergent receptors. The development of low-molecular-weight inhibitors that work equally well on the human and mouse proteins, as well as the description of mice in which LSECtin has been knocked out (Tang et al. 2009), thus provide opportunities for exploring the physiological functions of the human receptor using mouse models.",
