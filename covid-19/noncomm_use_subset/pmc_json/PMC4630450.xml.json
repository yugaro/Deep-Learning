In June 2010, an additional surveillance site was introduced at the Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex, periurban sites in North West Province. We stopped enrolling at CHBAH in December of 2013. In addition to SARI cases, controls were enrolled from May 2012 at 2 outpatient clinics serving the same population as 2 of the SARI sentinel sites: Edendale Hospital Gateway Clinic, KwaZulu-Natal Province, and Jouberton Clinic, North West Province. The case definitions used and enrollment procedures for both SARI cases and controls are described fully in the Supplementary Material.",

Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 10 respiratory viruses (PIV types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; influenza A and B viruses; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus, and rhinovirus) [17]. We did not test for PIV type 4 during the study period. We did not test for adenovirus from August to October 2009 because of unavailability of reagents. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified by quantitative real-time PCR detecting the lytA gene from whole blood specimens [20]. When available, HIV-infection status data were obtained through routine standard of care testing at the treating hospital. When not available, HIV testing was implemented at NICD through anonymized, linked dried blood spot specimen testing by HIV PCR assay for children aged <18 months and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for those aged \u226518 months.",

In our first analysis, we implemented univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to determine the association of PIV infection with SARI (for all types together and for each viral type separately) compared with controls enrolled from May 2012 to December 2014 at the sites in KwaZulu-Natal and North West Provinces. For the estimation of association with SARI, we conducted an overall analysis adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, respiratory viral coinfection, and underlying illness and subanalyses stratifying by age and HIV serostatus and adjusting for respiratory viral coinfection and underlying illness. Then, we estimated the attributable fraction (AF) from the odds ratio (OR) obtained from the multivariable model using the following formula: AF = (OR-1)/OR \u00d7 100. In our second analysis, univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with HIV infection among patients with PIV-associated SARI from January 2009 to December 2014 at all SARI sites. In our third analysis, we used multinomial regression to compare and contrast demographic and clinical characteristics and severity among patients infected with the 3 PIV types. For the multinomial analysis, we used PIV type 3 as the baseline category because type 3 is most common.",

Covariates with a P value of <.2 at univariate analysis were assessed for significance with multivariable analysis; statistical significance was assessed at P < .05 for all multivariable models. Two-way interactions were assessed by inclusion of product terms for all variables remaining in the final additive models. For each univariate analysis, we used all available case information. For important variables in the HIV association and AF analyses that had substantial missing data, namely HIV infection status, we multiply imputed that variable as well as any variables that were incomplete and associated with HIV using chained equation multiple imputation over 10 iterations. When adjusting for respiratory viral coinfection in our models, we evaluated coinfection with each virus separately and also as a combined variable of coinfection with any of the tested viruses.",

We found that a majority of SARI was attributable to PIV types 1 and 3 in children, even when controlling for viral respiratory coinfection, but not all studies have found that PIV is pathogenic. In fact, very few studies have adequately evaluated PIV in the context of controls. Two studies from Kenya that compared patients with respiratory illness to controls did not find a statistically significant attributable risk for PIV [6, 12]. However, a study comparing children <5 years of age from Thailand hospitalized with pneumonia to controls found findings similar to ours, specifically that infection with PIV types 1 or 3 was associated with disease [25]. The lower incidence and nonsignificant AF from our data among individuals \u22655 years of age suggests that PIV infection may not be associated with respiratory disease in older children and adults. We did not find a significant AF for patients infected with PIV type 2, but we may not have been powered to detect this because type 2 was the least common type.",

Although it is uncommon and uncommonly tested for, we did not test for PIV type 4, so our incidence estimates would be a minimum estimate. We also did not test for all viral respiratory pathogens, such as coronavirus and bocavirus. The large number of patients from CHBAH (70%) may bias results toward the epidemiology at that one site. Our calculation of incidence was for only 1 site and the calculation of AF was conducted at 2, so these analyses may not be representative of all regions in South Africa. The incidence may be an underestimate if patients did not seek medical care for their illness or sought care at a hospital other than CHBAH or died before reaching the hospital. The increased incidence of hospitalization among individuals infected with HIV may be due to a lower threshold for hospitalization compared with HIV-uninfected individuals. Lastly, we did not have data on steroid use, which is a common treatment for croup in children, and for patients with HIV infection, we did not have information on ART nor CD4 cell count.",

Among children, the observed incidence of PIV is higher in the HIV-infected population than the HIV-uninfected population. A vaccine to protect against PIV is not currently available, but vaccine candidates are in the clinical testing phase [30]. The findings of our study accentuate the need to target children for PIV prevention strategies including vaccination, should a vaccine against PIV become available.",
