            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a main cause of morbidity and mortality in children, with viruses being responsible for more than 80% of ARIs worldwide.12) Clinical manifestations of ARI can hardly differentiate bacterial from viral etiologies, which can lead to the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Recent development of the multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay makes noninvasive identification of respiratory pathogens possible. However, a more accurate diagnosis of causative ARI pathogens does not decrease hospital admissions or antibiotic use in children with ARI.3) Since viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children,4) identification of a virus by RT-PCR does not always imply that it is the culprit for a current ARI. Because these viruses are sometimes asymptomatic carriers and sometimes pathogens, a diagnosis should not be based solely on viral identification in respiratory samples. Moreover, new respiratory viruses have been increasingly recognized, but their clinical significance remains unclear.56) Thus, in addition to multiplex RT-PCR assays, a better understanding of these viruses is required to improve clinical management.",

Any possible bacterial coinfections were excluded by sputum and blood culture and clinical course.

The significance of multiple viral coinfections has been controversial. While it is unlikely to be associated with more severe illness,91314) specific pathogen pairs such as RSV with influenza virus may be associated with increased severity.9) Studies report strong causal attribution of RSV, IF, and hMPV, less strong evidence for hRV and no attribution of AdV, hBV and hCV,151617) which is in agreement with the ratio of single to multiple detections of each virus in our study. Quantitative viral analysis may help to distinguish active infection from viral shedding in cases with multiple viral coinfection.9)",

Seasonality of some respiratory viruses is an important clue for early recognition. In addition to the strong seasonal patterns observed with IF, RSV, and hMPV, it is interesting that RSV A and B have an apparent biennial seasonality. While hRV and AdV are prevalent throughout the year, seasonal patterns of viruses are discrete. Each respiratory viruses differ in seasonal onset as well as activity, but this can slightly vary from year to year. Knowing the seasonality of each virus will help to plan effective control strategies and to make epidemiological diagnosis.",

Premature birth history, and presence of congenital heart disease and chronic lung disease are not associated with any specific virus. While fever is a common symptom of ARI, cases of RSV and hRV are significantly afebrile. Infants younger than 6 months with RSV infection tend to be afebrile, which may be due to a lack of a pyrogenic cytokine response.1819) While patients with afebrile RSV cases are significantly younger than febrile RSV cases (2.6 months vs. 11.4 months, P=0.000 for RSV A, 4.9 months vs. 13.9 months, P=0.002 for RSV B), there is no age difference between afebrile and febrile hRV cases (23.8 months vs. 25.8 months, P=0.614) in this study, suggesting that pyrogenic immune responses might be different depending on the virus. Some viral respiratory infections are associated with asthma and asthma exacerbation.20) Cases of RSV and hRV ARI present more commonly with wheezing, but eosinophilia and a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation are associated only with hRV infection in this study. A study performed in children with acute wheezing illness reports that RSV is the predominant virus in patients with no previous wheezing, whereas hRV is predominant in patients with a history of wheezing.21) Whether RSV infection causes asthma is still debatable, but it is possible that lower ARI with pathogens such as hRV and RSV could precipitate the development of asthma, especially in children with atopic features.22)",
