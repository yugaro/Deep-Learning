First, repurposed drugs usually have well-known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to shorter development cycles and lower costs.12 In addition, these drugs may often tap into an already established manufacturing and distribution network, which shortens production and delivery times in cases of rapidly spreading epidemics. Finally, depending on which repurposed drugs are being identified, they may already be marketed as generics, which is a clear advantage in countries with resource-poor health care systems.",

Six of these studies introduced new drug screening methodologies and carried out pilot screens. In addition, different studies used varying methods to detect positively testing drugs. The most commonly applied technique was the measurement of luciferase activity in infected cells, a technique used in 3 studies.23, 28, 31 Other applied techniques included measurement of the inhibition of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression and inhibition of beta-lactamase activity. In addition to the conduction of drug library screens, 3 studies included additional preclinical trials (in vitro and in vivo) on selected drug candidates.24, 25, 27 Relevant items from these trials were extracted and analyzed together with the results from other preclinical studies.",

All of the animal studies were found to have a high risk of bias except 1 study with an unclear risk of bias. The high risk of bias in the animal studies was mainly due to selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias. The animal studies failed to mitigate selection bias because the test animals were selected without a proper randomization process, and thus the samples obtained were not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. The animal studies also failed to mitigate performance bias and detection bias by not blinding the investigators.",

In 2013, Madrid et al27 carried out an animal trial in which 8 out of 10 mice survived Ebola infection when treated with chloroquine twice daily at 90 mg/kg IP. In another study, intraperitoneal treatment with chloroquine at the same dose showed no significant protection and high toxicity in a mouse and hamster model.46 In 2015, Madrid et al48 were able to reproduce positive results upon repeat testing of chloroquine on Ebola-infected mice under identical conditions (90 mg/kg IP twice daily). Chloroquine administered orally at 40 mg/kg once daily showed no increase in survival.48 Our search did not yield any clinical trials for chloroquine.",

However, all 7 survivors received convalescent blood between Day 7 and Day 15 after the onset of symptoms. In a separate analysis, it was shown that the high rate of survival was due to the treatment of patients later in the course of disease, when they have a higher probability of survival.74",

First, a clear majority of included studies were categorized as screening, in vitro, or animal studies. Results from these studies cannot be used to reliably predict a positive response in humans.85, 86 In our review, only 3 studies were carried out on nonhuman primates, which are considered the gold standard for filovirus models because they resemble the human clinical manifestation of filoviral disease.87 The remaining 11 animal studies were carried out using adapted small animal models, such as mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs, which are not naturally susceptible to the Ebola virus. In these studies, it was necessary to use a genetically adapted virus that has undergone numerous mutations to achieve virulence and lethality. The genetic variation of an adapted Ebola virus together with differences in disease development compared with infected humans limit our ability to extrapolate results from these studies. Furthermore, our risk of bias assessment revealed a high risk of bias for 13 out of 14 animal studies. This limitation appears to be a shared concern amongst other fields of drug development.88",

First, until the recent EVD epidemic, this condition has been neglected and no major clinical research attempts were carried out. Second, clinical research during an outbreak faces many ethical and practical obstacles that influence study design, the number of participants, and settings.90, 91",
