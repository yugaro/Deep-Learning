The second visit, in the summer 3 months later, started in Raleigh, but also included a trip to Charleston, South Carolina, where the patient participated in tubing along the local river. It was during this nearly month\u2010long trip that the patient complained of a mosquito bite to his traveling companion. Two weeks later, he traveled to East Lansing, Michigan. Upon returning home to Australia 3 weeks later, the patient fell ill within 2 days, with his parents reporting fatigue, anorexia, and lethargy. Six days later, the patient suffered an acute encephalitic illness characterized by fevers to 39 \u00b0C, confusion, and postictal drowsiness following 2 generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. The patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Blood tests revealed lymphocytosis (23.3 \u00d7 109/l, normal range [NR] = 1.0\u20133.0 \u00d7 109/l) and a C\u2010reactive protein level of 17.9mg/l (NR \u2264 5mg/l). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed normal concentrations of protein (32 mg/dl) and glucose (77 mg/dl), with 87 \u00d7 106/l white blood cells (11% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 51% monocytes) and 19 \u00d7 106/l red blood cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion through the right fornix, extending into the right hippocampus and amygdala (Fig 1A, B) with interval development of contrast enhancement in the same brain structures 2 weeks later (Fig 1C, D). Microbiological tests, including culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for candidate pathogens, failed to identify an organism (Tables 1 and 2). The patient was treated empirically with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, benzylpenicillin, and vancomycin. Vancomycin and benzylpenicillin were discontinued due to the development of a rash on the patient's hip, and azithromycin was started due to left\u2010sided consolidation observed on his chest x\u2010ray. The patient completed 10 days of antimicrobial therapy with clinical improvement, and his seizure disorder was controlled with levetiracetam and sodium valproate. He was discharged from the hospital, but was readmitted 4 days later with hypersomnolence and a fluctuating level of consciousness. His antiepileptic medications were adjusted, and he was discharged home again. The patient made a partial recovery over the next 2 months but had new short\u2010term memory loss. He was ultimately able to return to work in a reduced capacity. Over the next 2 years, the patient remained seizure free. He utilized compensatory coping strategies at work due to the significant short\u2010term memory deficit, but he was otherwise independent with activities of daily living at home with his parents. There were reports of anxiety and fatigue, but no specific diagnoses were made.",

He was no longer able to work due to his encephalopathy and needed assistance with activities of daily living. Neurologic examination revealed that language was fluent but monotonous. His Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 7/30 with severe impairment in visuospatial and executive function, attention, abstraction, and delayed recall.8 He could not perform the Luria maneuver and was unable to mimic simple hand gestures. He had a fine, jerky, postural tremor with his arms outstretched. He had diffuse muscle rigidity with 6 beats of ankle clonus bilaterally. He could stand independently but had a broad\u2010based gait with reduced stride length, stooped posture, and en bloc turning. A follow\u2010up brain MRI demonstrated interval development of diffuse cerebral atrophy with ex vacuo hydrocephalus and additional focal atrophy of the right medial temporal lobe (Fig 2C and D). An MRI of the spinal cord was unremarkable. Repeat CSF examination was unremarkable (Table 2) and showed a normal opening pressure. Normal pressure hydrocephalus was excluded by large volume CSF extraction (30 ml) and comparative neuropsychological testing.",

The samples were submitted for unbiased mNGS under a research protocol (#13\u201012236) for the identification of potential pathogens approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). A common issue in metagenomic sequencing is that essentially all reagents used during the library preparation process contain some extraneous nucleic acid, including material commonly present in laboratory reagents.9, 10 The process of acquiring a human sample can also introduce unwanted nucleic acid from skin or environmental contamination. To control for irrelevant sequences, an unrelated, uninfected human CSF sample (\"control\") was prepared in parallel and sequenced on the same run in addition to a water control. Samples were processed for mNGS analysis as previously described.11, 12, 13 Briefly, total RNA was extracted. The sequencing library was prepared with New England Biolabs\u2019 (NEB; Ipswich, MA) NEBNext RNA First Strand Synthesis Module (E7525) and NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (E7550) to generate double\u2010stranded complementary DNA (cDNA). The cDNA was converted to Illumina (San Diego, CA) libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library preparation kit (E7645) according to the manufacturer's recommendation and amplified with 11 PCR cycles. The libraries were subjected to an additional step to selectively deplete library amplicons whose sequences corresponded to the human mitochondrial genome. This was accomplished via Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH), a novel molecular technique using the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)\u2010associated nuclease Cas9 in vitro.11, 13 The pooled library was size\u2010selected using Ampure beads, and concentration was determined using a Kapa Universal quantitative PCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA).

The same reads were also aligned to the NCBI nonredundant protein (nr) database using the Rapsearch2 algorithm.20 The resulting sequence hits identified at both the nt and protein (translated) level from the control patient and water samples were subtracted from each patient sample by matching genus or species level taxonomic identifications (taxids). Organisms were further investigated if they were present at >0.2 nonredundant, mapped read pairs per million read pairs at the species level based on nt alignment (1 read per 5 million nonredundant reads).",

As described above, the paired\u2010end sequences were processed through a custom bioinformatics pipeline. The runtime for the bioinformatics pipeline described above was 10 to 15 minutes per sample on a single 24\u2010core server. After filtering, there were 2 genera remaining in the mNGS dataset from the CSF sample: Bunyamwera virus (taxid: 35304) and cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (taxid: 12234). Only Bunyamwera virus was considered a credible pathogen. At the species level, the 5 unique pairs of Bunyamwera virus reads mapped to the CVV nucleoprotein and RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase with 89 to 100% similarity. Although no Bunyamwera virus sequences were identified in the nt results from the brain biopsy sample, the nr output identified 2 unique read pairs that mapped with 99 to 100% similarity to the CVV S (small) genome segment that encodes the nucleocapsid protein and a nonstructural protein. Thus, the very simple and conservative algorithm described above resulted in a single taxonomic category (CVV) in our patient's CSF sample, which, upon further investigation, was also present in the brain biopsy sample. CVV is an orthobunyavirus known to cause acute neuroinvasive disease but not a chronic meningoencephalitis. CVV sequences have never been previously detected in this laboratory, nor have CVV reagents or materials been present in this laboratory.

Ampicillin\u2010resistant colonies were Sanger sequenced (Quintara Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA). The cloned sequence unambiguously aligned to CVV (98% similarity); a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search of NCBI also returned only CVV hits and did not align to any other viruses. The RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase sequence of the most closely related Australian orthobunyavirus, Kowanyama virus (GenBank KC436108.1), had only 80% similarity to the viral polymerase sequences obtained from our subject's sample.22 Virus culture with fresh CSF was attempted on multiple cell lines (Vero, Vero E6, Aedes albopictus [C6/36], buffalo green monkey kidney, human fetal lung [MRC\u20105], and rhabdomyosarcoma [RD]) without success.

The possibility of having introduced a mosquito\u2010borne virus to a new locale is made even more salient by the recent international Zika virus crisis. The spread of Zika to Latin America was in part exacerbated by the delayed recognition of its introduction to Brazil. Recent phylogenetic studies have indicated that Zika virus was circulating for 18 months before it was identified as a pathogen, and for 24 months before it was determined that Zika was likely responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of microcephaly.40 The most dramatic example of a virus spreading undetected among human populations over many decades remains HIV\u20101.41\n",

            "text": "Because CVV is rarely identified as a cause of human disease and has not been reported in Australia previously, there are no traditional candidate\u2010based diagnostic tests for this virus available in Australia. This unusual case highlights the ability for mNGS to identify pathogens not previously associated with a clinical phenotype and not known to circulate in a geographic area.2, 3 It is also important to note that mNGS was able to identify CVV in the CSF of this patient; if these results had been available before the brain biopsy, they could have obviated the need for this invasive procedure. The ability to identify unanticipated infections in CSF via mNGS in this patient and others motivates the ongoing prospective, multicenter study currently underway to determine the performance characteristics of an mNGS CSF assay performed in a clinical laboratory environment for patients with acute meningitis with or without encephalitis (http://www.ciapm.org/project/precision-diagnosis-acute-infectious-diseases). When applied more broadly to global pathogen surveillance efforts, mNGS will significantly enhance the detection and monitoring of global biothreats. Finally, this case extends the spectrum of viruses known to cause chronic meningoencephalitis.",
