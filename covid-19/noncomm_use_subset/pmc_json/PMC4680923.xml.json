Five study centers were included: Northwestern University (Chicago, IL), Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada), North York General Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada), Royal Adelaide Hospital (Adelaide, Australia), and Westmead Hospital (Westmead, Australia). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Hospitalized patients with any of the following conditions were screened: influenza-like illness (ILI), suspected respiratory infection (pneumonia and other respiratory infection), acute respiratory failure (eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, asthma exacerbation), or fever. Patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza (using the study centers' in-house RT-qPCR) were eligible for this study. Influenza-positive patients underwent daily nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling starting from enrollment (baseline = day 1 of enrollment) to day 7 (or until discharge or death). Hospitalized patients or patients in the ICU who developed ILI during their hospitalization, or patients who met other criteria for entry into the study, were screened with PCR. If these patients were positive for infection and consented to participate in the study, they were observed for 7 days or until discharge. For ICU patients, if still hospitalized, every-other-day sampling continued in the second week until day 15 or hospital discharge.",

An internal extraction control (IEC) was added to all samples before the RNA extraction, as described previously [23, 24]. The RNA was eluted in 100 \u00b5L and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Real-time PCR was performed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol for influenza A virus (targeting the Matrix gene) with a panel of oligonucleotide primers and dually labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes [25], as previously described [24, 26]. Amplification and detection were performed on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). Each sample was tested in duplicate. All quantification cycle values were corrected for the loss of RNA during extraction by use of the IEC [23]. A standard RNA dilution series (external quantification control [EQC]) was tested in duplicate in each RT-qPCR experiment [24]. The VLs were calculated as the log10 copies/mL using the EQC standard curve, which has a linear range from 4.3 to 10.3 log10 copies/mL (lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] and upper limit of quantification). Samples with an influenza VL below LLOQ, but with a detectable amount of influenza RNA, were extrapolated. The lowest extrapolated quantity that could be measured was 3.25 log10 copies/mL. For quantification of influenza B viruses primers, targeting the NEP/NS1 gene (as described by the CDC), were used (InfB-FW: 5\u2032-TCCTCAAYTCACTCTTCGAGCG-3\u2032; infB-RV: 5\u2032-CGGTGCTCTTGACCAAATTGG-3\u2032; InfB-probe: FAM-5\u2032-CCAATTCGAGCAGCTGAAACTGCGGTG-BHQ-1-3\u2032 [Biosearch Technologies]).

Growth medium included 1000 mL UltraMDCK serum-free medium (VWR), 10 mL L-glutamine (200 mM; Life Technologies), and 400 \u00b5L gentamicin (50 mg/mL; Life Technologies). Infection medium consisted of the growth medium supplemented with 80 \u00b5L 2.5% trypsin (Life Technologies) and 10 mL fungizone (amphotericin B 250 \u00b5g/mL; Life Technologies). Each sample was tested in 8 replicates and 11 dilutions (1 sample/96-well plate). The MDCK cells were harvested and counted with the Vi-CELL (Beckman Coulter), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The MDCK cells were seeded (on day \u22121) at a concentration of 10 000 cells/100 \u00b5L growth medium per well in a 96-well plate (column 1\u201312). Plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. On day 0, serial dilutions of the viruses (1:10 for column 1 and subsequently 1:4 dilutions for column 2\u201311) were made in infection medium. The growth medium was removed from the MDCK cells, and 100 \u00b5L virus dilutions were added to the MDCK cells (column 1\u201311). Only infection medium was added to column 12 (negative control column). The A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) influenza strain (cultured in MDCK cells) was used as a positive control in every experiment (in 7 replicates). The empty wells (row H) on the control plate were filled with a dilution series (1:10 for column 1 and subsequently 1:4 dilutions for column 2\u201311) of UTM (negative control). Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Subsequently, the cytopathogenic effect was scored with visual interpretation for the Northern hemisphere samples. A chemiluminescent readout (ATPlite 1Step kit; PerkinElmer) using the Viewlux equipment (PerkinElmer) was used for the Southern hemisphere samples. This kit is a high-sensitivity ATP-monitoring one-step addition assay kit for the quantification of viable cells. The wells were scored positive or negative for infection according to a cutoff of 3.490 log10 relative luminescence units, defined by receiver operating characteristic analysis of positive control plates. The log10 TCID50/mL value was calculated in a template based upon the Reed-Muench method [27].",

Applying a Tobit regression enabled accounting for left-censored TCID50 and VL values, each with their respective limit of detections (LODs). The mixed-effect analysis allowed for the patients to randomly affect both the trend slopes and intercepts. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and the sample means were estimated using a left-censored bivariate normal likelihood-based approach as proposed by Lyles et al [29]. Figures were generated using R (version 3.0.2). Confidence bands for linear trend were calculated by sampling the bivariate normal distribution and were based on the regression coefficients for intercept and slope as well as their covariance matrix (n = 5000).",

Because the ratio is negative, this means that for an average patient, the TCID50 decays faster than the VL. For a 12-day observation period, the decay corresponds to a decline in relative infectivity of \u00b13 log10 viral RNA copies. Thus, the data document a significant decline of the relative infectivity of influenza A virus particles. It is important to note that this result is observed irrespective of the investigational site, subtype, or the presence of a coinfection.",

Influenza VL decay, which quantifies infectious and noninfectious viral particles over time, and TCID50 decay, which quantifies only the infectious viral particles over time, could be used as virological (secondary) measurements [16\u201318, 30, 31]. In this study, paired influenza A VL decay and TCID50 decay data points were available for 433 samples. The VL decay of 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 log10 copies per mL per day in this study is more pronounced but comparable with the respiratory tract A(H1N1)pdm09 decrease rates of 0.31 log10 VL units per day as reported by Lu et al [32]. Likewise, the TCID50 decay (\u22120.51 TCID50 [mL\u00b7day]\u22121) was comparable with the median decay rate of \u22120.39 TCID50 (mL\u00b7day)\u22121 (corresponding to a 10-fold drop every 2.6 days over a period of 4.5 days) reported by de Jong et al [16]. The mechanism of prolonged viral shedding, ie, the detection of influenza viral RNA for a longer time period, has been described in many studies [30, 33, 34]. The clinical (and infection control) relevance of detecting low levels of viral RNA in the absence of cultivable virus can be questioned. In this context, it should be noted that the virus culture methods are less sensitive than the molecular methods and that improper sampling handling could also have an impact. In this study, a high percentage of samples (n = 215) have levels of viral RNA in the absence of cultivable virus in the NP swabs despite proper sampling handling. It is important to include the percentage of infectious viral particles in virological measurements used in clinical studies of antiviral agents.",

To keep variability related to sample collection, processing, and transport as low as possible, well defined collection and shipping instructions were provided to all clinical sites. We have shown that there is a significant decline of the log ratio of TCID50/VL over time within the same patient.

Future studies could include this ratio into the virological measurements and investigate further the clinical relevance.",
