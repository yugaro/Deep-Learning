When translocated to the cytosol during mitochondrial damage, several mitochondrial components are reported to trigger NLRP3 activation, including cardiolipin and mtDNA,12, 13, 14, 15 although these remain controversial. Mechanistically, it is unclear how these components may become liberated from the mitochondrial inner membrane (cardiolipin) or matrix (mtDNA) for participation in NLRP3 signalling in the cytosol. Mitochondrial network dynamics, metabolic state and mitoROS can all influence NLRP3 activation and the inflammatory signalling capacity of a cell. It is thus possible that mitochondria, mitoROS or mtDNA promote NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and cytokine processing through an indirect mechanism. As mitochondria may stimulate NLRP3 activity through mechanisms other than membrane rupture and release of mitochondrial components, it is important to consider the mitochondrial network holistically, as a complex and dynamic organelle. Aside from NLRP3, other PRRs sense mitochondrial molecules to induce inflammatory signalling, amongst which TLR9, AIM2 and cGAS will be discussed herein. Here, we review mitochondrial functions in innate immunity and speculate how mitochondria may influence PRR activity during infection and disease. The mechanisms by which mitochondria influence PRR activity and drive inflammatory responses are important research foci for understanding protective innate immune functions during host defence against infection, as well as innate immune pathology in disease.",

It is currently unclear how DRP1 constriction sites are specified; however, this may involve ER mitochondria\u2010associated membranes (MAMs)21 and the actin cytoskeleton.22 NLRP3 activation by K+ efflux\u2010inducing agents (ATP, MSU, silica, nigericin) is reported to be partially dependent on phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5), a serine/threonine phosphatase located on the mitochondrial outer membrane.23 PGAM5 may recruit and dephosphorylate DRP1, activating DRP1 and promoting mitochondrial fission.24 The inner mitochondrial membrane has its own fission machinery that operates in parallel to the outer membrane. Another GTPase, OPA1, maintains the integrity of the matrix. OPA1 loss or functional downregulation leads to inner membrane fission.25, 26, 27 How DRP1 and OPA1 coordinate events at both membranes to execute mitochondrial fission is unclear, and yet they do so seamlessly. Both proteins are required for effective mitophagy, and inhibition of either is sufficient to induce the accumulation of damaged mitochondria.17 The reverse process of mitochondrial fusion is induced by suppression of the fission machinery or upregulation of fusion machinery. In mammals, mitofusins (MFNs) 1 and 2 (Figure 1) participate in multiprotein complexes to fuse fragmented mitochondria to form a tubular network.28, 29 This dynamic regulation of mitochondrial morphology is important for repair, equal distribution of mitochondrial mass during replication, and starvation\u2010induced metabolic responses.30 Mitochondria are labile and responsive organelles that modulate immune signalling, as is highlighted by mitochondrial dynamics during microbial infection.",

One reported mechanism of stress sensing involves NLRP3 recognition of mislocalised mtDNA during mitochondrial dysfunction. NLRP3 activation in mouse macrophages can be associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or defective mitophagy, leading to mitoROS production and mtDNA release from mitochondria to the cytosol.69, 73, 74, 75 Oxidised mtDNA was reported to promote NLRP3 activation.14 In this study, the authors observed direct interaction between transfected bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)\u2010labelled mtDNA and ectopically expressed NLRP3 in HEK293 cells, suggestive of a ligand\u2013receptor relationship. In wild\u2010type BMDMs, endogenous mtDNA labelled with BrdU co\u2010immunoprecipitated with NLRP3 after LPS priming and a signal 2 (nigericin or ATP); however, this study did not confirm that this interaction was upstream, rather than downstream, of NLRP3 signalling. Since this initial report that mtDNA may activate NLRP3, subsequent studies have disagreed over the sequence of events leading to mtDNA liberation and sensing by NLRP3. Several groups describe mtDNA release as a signal 2\u2010dependent, NLRP3\u2010independent process that is required for NLRP3 activation.74, 75, 76 In one report, mtDNA immunoprecipitated with the NLRP3 complex after mouse BMDMs were treated with palmitic acid.75 In another, TLR4 ligation by LPS (signal 1) upregulated mtDNA synthesis, while NLRP3 activators (signal 2; ATP, nigericin) promoted colocalisation of oxidised mtDNA with the NLRP3 inflammasome.76 In all, these reports suggest a model in which mtDNA liberation from mitochondria occurs prior to, and is required for, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 2a). NLRP3 can also sense cytosolic DNA indirectly, via cell signalling through the cyclic GMP\u2010AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of IFN genes (STING) axis.77 Many signal 2 stimuli induce cellular K+ efflux to activate NLRP3; however, it is unclear whether ionic flux drives NLRP3 activation in parallel to, or up\u2010 or downstream of, mitochondrial disruption and mtDNA release. Additionally, nigericin can integrate directly into the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce hyperpolarisation,78 and so some signal 2 stimuli may directly perturb mitochondria in parallel to inducing ionic changes in the cytosol.",

Disabling autophagy (and by extension mitophagy) in mouse BMDMs resulted in mitoROS\u2010 and NLRP3\u2010dependent liberation of mtDNA from the mitochondrial matrix.73 Here, retention of dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria was alone insufficient for mtDNA translocation to the cytosol; the latter required NLRP3 signalling. Another study reported the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as NLRP3\u2010dependent, yet caspase\u20101\u2010independent.69 In keeping with the assertion that loss of membrane potential is a consequence rather than cause of NLRP3 activation, another study reported that NLRP3 deficiency in renal tubular cells protected mitochondria against depolarisation during hypoxia.79 The above models may not be mutually exclusive; it is possible that an early loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity results in just enough externalised mtDNA to participate in NLRP3 signalling, which then drives further mitochondrial damage. In line with this, one study examining temporal changes in mitochondrial stability during NLRP3 activation reported that LPS\u2010primed BMDMs treated with ATP or nigericin exhibited some inflammasome\u2010independent mitochondrial hyperpolarisation at early time points (up to 15 min post treatment).

Currently, the field is yet to reach a consensus on mechanisms mediating the permeabilisation of the two mitochondrial membranes that envelop mtDNA. We pose several hypotheses for mechanisms by which mtDNA may directly or indirectly drive NLRP3 signalling in Figures 2 and 3. Until mitochondrial perforation mechanisms are discovered, the true biology may remain elusive.",

While mechanisms controlling mitochondrial fission and fusion are not fully characterised, several key proteins exert key functions in these processes. Upper: Fission of an individual mitochondrion from the network is mediated by the GTPase DRP1, which operates in a \u2018kiss and run\u2019 manner. Asymmetric fission is driven by changes in metabolism, damage, mitotic division or infection by specific viral and bacterial agents, and occurs when DRP1 oligomerises on the outer membrane and coils around the section to be \u2018pinched\u2019 off. In a parallel fission process, OPA1 is downregulated at the inner membrane portions targeted for fission. It is currently unclear whether DRP1\u2010mediated outer membrane fission occurs at sites where the mitochondrial matrix is already separated (as shown above), or requires the inner membrane to be pinched off in a manner similar to the outer membrane. If the mitochondrion is damaged, it is degraded by mitophagy. Lower: Fusion counters fission. An individual mitochondrion \u2018docks\u2019 to the mitochondrial network via MFN1 and MFN2, which anchor the opposing outer membranes and shape the lipid bilayer into extreme curvature. The membranes are forced to create a bridge and eventually reincorporate the mitochondrion back into the network, where, presumably, OPA1 reattaches between the inner membranes to support these as discrete compartments. It is currently unclear whether OPA1 drives true fusion of the inner membranes as DRP1 does for the outer membrane, or if it anchors two discrete matrix compartments to one another. Fusion is presumed to allow mitochondria to maintain an even distribution of matrix components across the network and may also be reparative. Fusion is promoted by cell infection with specific viruses.",
