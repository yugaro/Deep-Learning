Owing to its\nunique flavor and attractive color and texture, preserved egg is a popular marinated\negg product in China. In addition, the percentage of nine amino acids in preserved\negg yolk and egg white was higher than that of fresh egg yolk and egg white after\npickling (Zhang et al., 1998), the species of\ntotal fatty acids were increased from 23 to 27, as well as the species of free fatty\nacids were increased from 7 to 13 (Zhao et al., 2014a), which makes preserved eggs have a higher nutritional value.",

            "text": "Many alkaline-fermented foods, such as preserved eggs, plant beans, seeds, and\nleaves, are consumed extensively in China, Japan, Africa, and Southeast Asia. After\nalkali- fermentation, the nutritional value of food can be enhanced, which is\nclosely related to the conversion of proteins to amino acids (Odunfa, 1988). Compared to fresh duck eggs, preserved\neggs have higher protein contents and lower carbohydrate contents (Hou, 1981). Furthermore, alkaline-forming food has\nbeen shown to inhibit the growth and invasion of tumor cell in\nvitro (Corder et al., 2001).\nStudies have shown that preserved egg white hydrolysates show anti-inflammatory\neffects in vitro and in vivo experiments and can\nsignificantly decrease the expression levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (Zhao et al.,\n2017). In addition, ACE-inhibitory\npeptides isolated from preserved eggs proved their antioxidant activity in\nvitro (Yang, 2016). Numerous\nstudies have indicated that alkaline foods, such as kelp (Yuan and Walsh, 2006), grape (Renaud and De, 1992), and bitter gourd (Rajasekhar et al.,\n2012), can inhibit the growth of various\nhuman cancer cell lines. The results showed that the algae polyphenols extracted\nfrom kelp can inhibit the rancidity of fish oil and the antioxidant efficiency was\n2.6-fold higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Yan et al., 1996). Researchers found that seaweed\npolyphenols can significantly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and the\ninhibition effect was linearly correlated to the total level of phenol in seaweed\n(Yuan and Walsh, 2006). Resveratrol in grapes\nwas shown to have inhibitory effects on cancer cell initiation, proliferation and\ndevelopment (Corder et al., 2001).",

FAS is the key enzyme in\nliver fatty acid synthesis, TG increases with the increasement of the FAS\n(Postic and Girard, 2008).",

In the\nlow-dose group, TG and TCHO contents were decreased by 19.5% and 6.8% respectively,\nindicating that the preserved eggs are conductive in antilipemic capacity. This\ncould be involved with several major influencing factors: 1) some active substance\nsuch as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (Miettinen et al., 1988; Kes\u00e4niemi et al., 1987) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotype (Morise et al.,\n1994) may promote the lipoprotein\nmetabolism and transformation in the liver; 2) the substances above may inhibit the\nintestinal absorption of cholesterol, further reducing the synthesis of cholesterol\nand improving the decomposition rate of TG in the liver (Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, results also showed that\nthe preserved eggs can significantly reduce the LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C level in\nrat\u2019s liver. After treatment with preserved eggs of low dose, the LDL-C\nlevels in the liver were reduced by 92.8% compared with the control group. In\nprevious studies, LDL and LDL / HDL could be used to predict CVD, and the risk of\nCVD can be reduced lowering by 20% if LDL-C wad reduced by 1 mmol/L (Baigent et al.,\n2005). Based on this, we suspected that\nactive ingredients such as lecithin in preserved eggs may have the potential to\nreduce the risk of CVD, AS, and other diseases by inhibiting the synthesis of LDL-C\nand promoting the synthesis of HDL-C (Poutanen et al., 2003). In future, we will do further experiments to find out\nthe exactly active ingredients. Furthermore, the intake of preserved eggs depressed\nthe production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and these indicators are significantly\nrelated to the occurrence of inflammation and cancer in rats (Kim et al., 2013; Suganuma et al., 2012).

This result is consistent\nwith the results of other studies (Zhao et al., 2017). Combinning with the results of cell apoptosis, we suspected that\nthis is more likely to be related to mitochondrial pathways (Dass\u00e9 et al.,\n2007; Lanvin et al., 2004).
