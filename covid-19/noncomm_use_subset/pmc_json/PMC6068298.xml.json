Reverse transcription\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Primescript One Step RT-PCR kit (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan). In a preliminary experiment, we could not amplify cDNA fragments encompassing\nthe whole predicted canine SIRT1 coding region (GenBank Accession No. XM_546130.4). Thus, primer pairs were designed to amplify two overlapping DNA fragments that cover the\nwhole SIRT1 coding region by nested and semi-nested PCR. In the first PCR, 5\u2032-end and 3\u2032-end DNA fragments were amplified by One-Step RT-PCR using the Sense_1-Reverse_1 and\nSense_2-Reverse_2 primer pairs, respectively (Table 1). PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 3 min. Then RT-PCR products were used as templates, nested and\nsemi-nested PCRs were conducted by GoTaq\u00ae Hot Start Colorless Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), to amplify 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 cDNA fragments using the Sense_3-Reverse_3 and Sense_2-Reverse_1\nprimer pairs (Table 1). The PCR conditions were the same as the first PCR. The second set of PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose. DNA\nfragments were extracted from the gel and purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dye\nterminator method at a commercial laboratory, Fasmac (Atsugi, Japan). We also investigated canine SIRT1 transcript variants by 5\u2032-terminal inverse PCR amplification. Total\nRNA was extracted as mentioned above from blood samples obtained from a client owned Labrador Retriever. The 5\u2032-end of canine SIRT1 cDNA was amplified using a 5\u2032-Full RACE\nCore Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The nucleotide sequence of the 5\u2032-phosphorylated primer for reverse transcription (RT-primer) is shown in Table 1. Inverse nested PCRs were performed using GoTaq\u00ae Hot Start Colorless Master Mix.

Because this transcript was amplified only in one sample, 5\u2032 inverse RT-PCR was\nconducted to detect other transcript variants. Two DNA fragments were amplified: one variant starts at nucleotide 456 (named Variant 2, INSD accession No. LC342296) of the predicted canine\nSIRT1 mRNA (XM_546130.4), and the other starts at nucleotide 626 (named Variant 3, INSD accession No. LC342297; Fig. 1).

In this study, three 5\u2032 transcription variants were detected in PBMC from dogs. At least six\nvariants have been reported in both human and mouse (The AceView genes, NCBI). Most variants in human are shorter with a deletion at exon 1 or exon 2. Though we did not examine the function of\nthe three transcript variants in dogs, some studies have demonstrated that the SIRT1 transcript variants function differently from the full-length SIRT1,\nespecially at the interaction point with p53 [27, 45]. We detected three variants by an RT-PCR-based method and\nonly one band of approximately 120 kDa was observed by western blotting. The deduced molecular size of the canine SIRT1 protein was 70.9 kDa (Variant 1) and 62.1 kDa (Variants 2 and 3). The\ndeduced molecular size of human SIRT1 was 81.6 kDa. We detected a 128-kDa band using HEK293 cells, as shown in a previous study using muscle samples [7]\nand in the 1F3 antibody product data sheet supplied by the manufacturer (CST). The differences in observed SIRT1 molecular sizes are likely due to posttranslational glycosylation. The bands\ndetected by western blotting in canine PBMCs presumably derived from Variants 2 and 3 mainly because only these variants were detected by inverse RT-PCR. However, the molecular size of SIRT1\nderived from each transcript variants should be clarified by the expression of recombinant SIRT1 in canine cells.",

Because this cell line is derived from human, 1F3 also reacted with\nthe endogenous human SIRT1. However, a marked enhancement of the signal was demonstrated in the canine SIRT1 expression plasmid-transfected cells. These results indicated that intracellular\ncanine SIRT1 is detectable by flow cytometry using 1F3 antibody. Recently, compounds that activate SIRT1 enzymatic activity have been intensely investigated in association with lifespan\nextension.

In this study, we examined intracellular SIRT1 level in peripheral blood lymphocytes for ease of access in clinical cases. Though some studies measured the serum SIRT1\nconcentration to evaluate the SIRT1 expression level [10, 24, 29, 32, 52], the significance of the plasma SIRT1 concentration remains to be clarified because SIRT1 localizes mainly in\nthe nucleus or the cytoplasm. SIRT1 in the cellular lysate and in the serum can potentially be measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in dogs. However, as only one antibody is\navailable at present, it may be difficult to establish sensitive and specific Sandwich ELISA to measure canine SIRT1. The information on the canine SIRT1 5\u2032-end transcript\nvariants obtained in this study will be useful for the development of antibodies and ELISA for canine SIRT1 measurement.",

            "text": "Minimally invasive procedures for sample collection make it easier to monitor the fluctuation of SIRT1 expression. Flow cytometry analysis can evaluate SIRT1 expression levels in individual\ncells, thus enabling comparison of the expression between leukocyte subsets. In this study, flow cytometry analysis was conducted using a blood sample residues (usually less than 1\nml of blood) obtained from animals in veterinary care. SIRT1 seemed to be expressed in all leukocyte subsets: lymphocytes, monocytes, and contaminated granulocytes. In human\ndiabetes patients, SIRT1 was detected in monocytes and granulocytes, but not in lymphocytes, by immunocytochemical staining [52]. The discrepancy may be\nbecause of species differences or the high sensitivity of flow cytometry applied in this study. Because the permeability of the cells may differ between the samples, we used \u03b2-actin as an\ninternal control for evaluating SIRT1 protein expression. The compensated SIRT1 expression level markedly varied among individual dogs. Though major factors that influence the SIRT1 expression\nwere not fully clarified in this study, the level in neutered female dogs was higher than intact-female and intact-male dogs. Variance of SIRT1 protein expression by age and gender has also\nbeen reported in human [22, 25, 34]. But the trend of the variance in human\nwas study dependent probably reflecting the difference of sample tissue and method applied. While negative correlation between SIRT1 expression and obesity has also been demonstrated in human\n[19, 31, 33, 48], significant\ncorrelation between SIRT1 expression and body condition score of the dogs was not found in this study. Because the samples were obtained from dogs admitted for veterinary care, other factors\nincluding disease, medication, as well as circadian change might influence the SIRT1 expression [1]. Comparison of SIRT1 expression among species or\nindividuals in specific condition may contribute to further understanding the regulation of SIRT1 expression. Transcription factors including HIC1, E2F1 and FOXO are involved in the regulation\nin response to environmental change in humans [5, 40, 46]. Most of the\nresponsive elements to these factors are located within 1kb upstream from SIRT1 initiation codon. Though the promoter/enhancer region of the canine SIRT1 gene\nhas not been completely analyzed, nucleotide sequence of the region is well conserved between two species. Future studies using a large number of samples in specific condition may clarify\nmajor contributing factors that influence SIRT1 expression in dogs.",
