            "text": "Shock is a true emergency medical condition, defined as inadequate blood perfusion to the body's tissues. This situation causes an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply, and leads to serious damage.1 Therefore, it definitely needs prompt diagnosis and management, and serial assessments.2 There are some major categories for better understanding and proper approach to shock including distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and combined.3, 4 To emphasize the importance of this topic, it should be mentioned that shock usually needs treatment before finding out the exact underlying cause. Septic shock, which is a subgroup of the distributive category, is considered as a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits all around the world.5 This type of shock needs adequate fluid therapy alongside antibiotic and probably corticosteroid administration. Assessment of the severity of circulatory fluid depletion in these patients, and reassessment of the situation during treatment is crucial and needs a ruler for better performance. Central venous pressure (CVP), along with some other parameters, has been used in this regards in ED. To measure the CVP, an invasive procedure should be performed to insert a central venous catheter (CVC). This procedure needs special preparation, including proper equipment, knowing the coagulation profile of the patient, and an expert physician. It is clear that these properties cannot be prepared in all EDs. If other less-invasive and routine parameters can estimate CVP, management of septic shock will be facilitated. Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis provides some parameters that are useful in this regard.2 Detailed explanation pathophysiologically connection between tissue hypoxia, hypoperfusion and acidosis with CVP might help for better understanding the aspect. It is obvious that tissue hypoxia resulted from hypoperfusion happens in early stages of septic shock. The anticipated result should be acidosis that could be finding out by VBG analysis parameters.5, 6 CVP measures the perfusion, so it is conceivable to be a correlation between CVP and VBG analysis parameters. This study was conducted to assess the correlation between CVP and VBG analysis parameters to facilitate septic shock management in ED.",

For selected patients, peripheral blood sample was taken for testing VBG (measurement of pH, base excess (BE), and HCO3), sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl), and also the anion gap (AG) was calculated. These data along with demographic data were registered in a prepared checklist. Fluid challenge test 8, 9 with infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h was performed and those with more than 3 cmH2O raise in CVP were excluded. All mentioned parameters were measured again for remained patient. Fig. 1 showed the patient flow diagram in this study.",

Therefore, fluid therapy needs a reliable, available, and fast measurement tool for estimating the intravascular volume. Despite the wide use of CVP as a tool to guide fluid therapy, there are still some negative points in this regard.14 Use of CVP implies insertion of a central venous line, which requires specialized health institutions and highly trained personnel, and can be associated with significant morbidities. CVC causes more than 90% of catheter related infections in hospitalized patients.15 Thrombosis of internal jugular and subclavian veins occur in 33\u201367% of patients if the catheter is used for more than 7 days.16 Several studies have doubted the efficacy of CVP as a consistent measure in monitoring shock patients due to persistence of elevated shock index even after normalization of this parameter.17 In a study by Kumar et al., CVP & pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) failed to prove a significant correlation with stroke volume and end diastolic volume.18 Also, the use of CVP in evaluating shocked patients can be impaired by multiple confounding factors such as right ventricular dysfunction and valvular heart diseases.8 Other studies have concluded the superiority of dynamic circulatory markers such as variation in cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume, over static measures like CVP and PAOP due to their accurate reflection of intravascular volume.19, 20",

The findings of our study are sort of consistent with the results of a study performed by Kaplan et al. on traumatic patients, showing that the initial measurement of pH, BD, and AG at the ED could predict survival in patients with major vascular injury.21 They also correlate with the results of a pilot diagnostic study by Baratloo et al. which concluded that the correlation between CVP and VBG parameters such as pH, anion gap and bicarbonate can be used to develop a non-invasive tool for monitoring patients with septic shock.2 Considering the findings of current study and also pathophysiology of septic shock, it could be recommended to pay more attention to such easily available paraclinic findings for shock management in ED. Specially BE and HCO3 that directly affected by metabolic acidosis as a result of shock may be more reasonable.",

If so, it could be used at clinic practice. Even base excess that did not show significant statistical correlation with CVP in current study, could be consider as a valuable parameter for evaluating the process and efficacy of fluid therapy.
