However, the primary care system in South Korea is not yet well-established. The Korean health care system is market-oriented and focused on treatment rather than prevention, which encourages further diagnosis and utilization of the large hospital sector. This leads to medically undesirable and unnecessary health care utilization and increased costs.1) The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea was also related to the failure of the Korean primary care system. Therefore, strengthening of the primary care is essential for solving many health care problems in South Korea.",

To estimate the causal effect by adjusting for unbalanced confounding covariates between treatment and control groups, this study used a counterfactual framework (also known as potential outcome framework) and propensity score (PS) analysis.1112) In the PS analysis, the probability of treatment conditional on baseline confounding covariates was first estimated and these conditional probability estimates were used for estimation of treatment effect.1314) We estimated potential-outcome means (POMs) and average treatment effect (ATE) in the general population, patients with hypertension, and those with diabetes mellitus (DM) using an augmented inverse-probability-weighted (AIPW) estimator that combined elements of regression adjustment on PS and PS weighting estimation among several PS analysis methods.15) In the counterfactual framework, each subject had two potential outcomes. One outcome would manifest if the subject were exposed to the treatment and another outcome would manifest if the same subject were exposed to the control. The difference between these two means of potential outcomes was defined as the ATE. We calculated PS using logistic regression analysis with baseline covariates and applied to the AIPW estimator. We used Stata/IC ver. 14.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) for analysis, applied cross-sectional weights, and estimated the confidence intervals using robust standard error.",

First, although the counterfactual framework and PS analysis allow justifiable causal inferences by adjusting for sample selection bias, it is not complete without controlling for the problem of endogeneity. Endogeneity is kind of omitted variable bias that comes from unobserved confounding variables. In our study, participants with poor health may have had a higher probability of having a regular doctor as well as a higher rate of ER visits. Thus, the insignificant ATE in the general population and patients with hypertension may be due to this problem. In order to make more causal inferences, this problem should be controlled. Second, we did not consider the fact that the qualities and characteristics of the regular doctor such as comprehensiveness, care coordination, and individual-focused continuity may affect ER visits. Therefore, further research on the effect of these characteristics is required.",
