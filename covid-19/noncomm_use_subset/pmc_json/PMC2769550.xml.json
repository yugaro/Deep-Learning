For instance, avian metapneumovirus (MPV), which primarily attacks the respiratory tract, replicates inefficiently in embryonic eggs. Diagnosis of MPV infection is mainly dependent on the detection of viral RNA or viral antigens, but not viral isolation [5, 6]. In addition, to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses (AIV) requires efficient and sensitive viral detection and amplification system for comprehensive collection of the viruses from waterfowl and migratory birds [17, 31]. However, the wild-bird isolated AIV are usually mildly or non-pathogenic to chicken embryos [20, 26] and the efficiency of viral isolation is often unsatisfactory in embryonated eggs [11, 19].",

The environment of the viral replication may also selectively modify the original cell tropism and pathogenesis of the isolated virus [15, 25]. It has been shown that a serially embryo-passaged of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) M41 strain exhibited significantly attenuated pathogenesis within the oviduct compared to the parental strain [7]. In addition, egg-mediated epitope alterations in amplified isolates might attenuate the protective efficiency of these viruses when used to vaccinate against the challenge of a wild-type virulent strain [16, 24]. For instance, after egg adaption, human influenza A virus, originally showing \u03b12-6 sialic acid tropism only, exhibits increased hemagglutinin (HA) binding affinity to \u03b12-3 sialic acid-containing gangliosides due to amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the receptor binding site of the HA protein [8, 15]. For primary viral isolates, providing natural host cells for replication might eliminate the selection pressure of an exotic growth environment and avert the alteration of cell tropism and consequent genomic mutations.",

In addition, the global profile of mRNA expression in the cultured cells showed that cytokeratin 14 (K14), a basal cell marker, was highly expressed. However, the protein expression of cell-type specific markers and the existence of mucin-secreting goblet cell are not well-characterized. In this study, we developed a novel culture system to isolate, amplify and passage chicken tracheal epithelial cells in an efficient manner. The avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cell types were identified using immunocytostaining, and the ratio of cell types is statistically illustrated. We further demonstrate that primary ATE cells support IBV replication. The susceptible cell types and the effect of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on IBV attachment to ATE cells was also investigated.",

To culture the ATE cells, specialized commercial media for the tracheal epithelia of humans and rats were first tested (described in the Materials and methods section). None of them supported cell growth or long-term viability of ATE cells. Adjustment of the concentration of retinoic acid, a differentiating factor for tracheal epithelial cells [10], did not affect attachment or cell growth of ATE cells. Increasing FBS from 10% to 20% in the culture medium modestly enhanced the viability of the cells (data not shown). We speculated that unidentified chicken nutrients essential for the promotion of ATE cell growth were absent in the culture medium. CEE, an essential supplement for the culture of mouse neural crest stem cells [27], was added to DMEM-F12 medium with 10% FBS. We found that CEE significantly improved cell growth and reduced cell death of the primary ATE cells (Figs. 1B and 1C). The cell number of initial harvest from one trachea on day 1 is about 2 \u00d7 105 cells. With this optimized culture medium, isolated cells displayed increased MTT activity, and the cell-doubling time was 46 h during the first 6 days of culture (Fig. 1D).

In this study, highly sulfated GAG, such as H and DS, and common GAG, such as HS and CS, were tested to determine whether they possess different neutralizing effects on binding of Taiwan-isolated IBV to ATE cells. JEV was used as a positive control for the evaluation of the GAG effect [28]. Figure 5A shows that both H and DS at 7.5 \u03bcg/mL effectively blocked JEV infection in BHK-21 cells, as previously reported [28]. Complete inhibition of JEV infection was achieved when the concentrations of H and DS were elevated to 30 \u03bcg/mL. Although low concentrations of HS and CS did not affect JEV infection, a modest neutralizing effect was observed when the concentrations of HS and CS were elevated to 30 \u03bcg/mL. In contrast to the JEV results, even when all of the tested GAG were applied at 2.0 mg/mL, no significant inhibitory effects were observed on the infection of primary ATE cells by TW2575/98 (Fig. 5B). In addition, the GAG did not alter the cell tropism of IBV on cilia cells or goblet cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the binding affinity of GAG for IBV is too low to interfere with viral entry into tracheal epithelial cells.\n",

Our results with primary ATE cells also showed that IBV viral protein can be detected in both ciliated cells and goblet cells. This cell tropism may account for the pathogenesis of IBV, such as the ciliostasis in observed IBV-infected TOC and the reduction of sialic acid secretion [3, 22]. In addition, we are the first to demonstrate that IBV does not appear to infect K14-positive basal cells. In an uncomplicated IBV-infected chick, clinical signs such as gasping, coughing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge persist for only 5-to-7 days and disappear within 2 weeks [3, 22]. In the recovery stage, unaffected basal cells may be responsible for epithelial hyperplasia after desquamation of the ciliated and goblet cells and reconstruction of the epithelium of the injured respiratory tract to reestablish normal physiological functioning [12, 13, 22]. The insensitivity of basal cells to IBV infection also suggests that coinfection with other viral or bacterial pathogens is required to disrupt basal membrane integrity and cause hemorrhage in IBV-infected tracheas.",
