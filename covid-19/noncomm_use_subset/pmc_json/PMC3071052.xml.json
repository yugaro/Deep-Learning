RhMBL effectively blocked Ebola GP interactions with DC-SIGN, and HIV particles lacking gp120/gp41 pseudotyped with Ebola or Marburg GPs were neutralized by the lectin complement pathway [2]. To develop an in vivo test of rhMBL effectiveness, we determined that 100 ng/mL of rhMBL was the minimum concentration needed to inhibit \u226590% infectivity of HepG2 cells using Ebola GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to inhibit \u226590% infectivity of Vero E6 cells using recombinant Ebola Zaire virus (Mayinga strain)-eGFP (data not shown). We had previously found that a single intraperitoneal dose of 75 \u03bcg of rhMBL reconstituted the lectin complement pathway in MBL-knockout mice [1]. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters (Table 1) of that single reconstitution dose (4.3 mg/kg) with a higher single intraperitoneal dose of 350 \u03bcg (20 mg/kg) to identify a potentially supraphysiological dose to test in model infections. The average maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of both doses exceeded the minimum concentration of MBL that inhibited infection in vitro by at least 55-fold. The average ratio of maximum to baseline complement component 4 cleavage activity was 1.7 for the 75-\u03bcg rhMBL dose and 5.4 for the 350-\u03bcg dose.",

Treatment with 75 \u03bcg of rhMBL per dose every 12 hours failed to protect mice from that virus inoculum. Therefore, we increased rhMBL to 350 \u03bcg administered every 12 hours for 10 days starting either 1 hour before or 12 hours after Ebola virus challenge (Figure 1A and 1B). When treatment was started 1 hour before virus infection, the supraphysiological dose increased survival to > 40% of mice in several trials (Figure 1A). We then started treatment 12 hours after viral infection. We compared survival in wild-type and complement component 3 (C3)\u2013deficient mice as the inhibitory effects of MBL on Ebola virus are mediated by complement in cell culture [2]. Once again we saw an increase in survival from 0% to >40% in rhMBL-treated mice, and survival was dependent on an intact complement pathway, since C3-deficient mice did not survive (Figure 1B). All inoculated mice showed signs of infection according to standardized observation scores and weight loss, and surviving mice had detectable Ebola virus\u2013specific antibodies 28 days after infection (data not shown).",

(A) Mouse survival when treated with rhMBL before Ebola virus inoculation. Sham-treated wild-type mice were compared with wild-type mice receiving 350 \u03bcg of rhMBL (referred to as Rx) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 12 hours starting 1 hour before mouse-adapted Ebola virus (EBO) challenge (100 pfu). Shown is a Kaplan-Meier probability curve for mouse survival at the indicated times (*log-rank Mantel-Cox test, P = .0075). (B) Mouse survival when treated with rhMBL after Ebola virus inoculation. Sham-treated mice were compared with mice receiving 350 \u03bcg of rhMBL administered i.p. every 12 hours starting 12 hours after mouse-adapted Ebola virus challenge (100 pfu). Both wild-type (WT) and knockout mice lacking complement component 3 (C3 KO) were compared. Shown is a Kaplan-Meier probability curve for mouse survival at the indicated times (*log-rank analyses; WT: sham-treated vs rhMBL-treated, P = .0013; rhMBL-treated: WT versus C3 KO, P = .0003). (C) Platelet count analyses. RhMBL-treated mice had significantly lower platelet counts on day 5 after Ebola virus inoculation than sham-treated mice (*P = .014). (D) Viral plaque assays. RhMBL-treated mice tended to have lower viral titers than sham-treated mice but the differences were not statistically significant. (E) Intrahepatic cytokine responses. RhMBL-treated mice had lower proinflammatory and T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine titers in liver homogenates on day 5 after inoculation (P values as shown). (F) Anti\u2013Ebola virus titers in mice surviving Ebola virus infection. Fifteen wild-type mice received a 10-day course of rhMBL administered every 12 hours that was started 1 hour before inoculation with 100 pfu of mouse-adapted Ebola virus as indicated. Antibody (Ab) titers were obtained on day 21 and again on day 56. Mice were rechallenged with Ebola virus on day 28. The reciprocals of anti\u2013Ebola virus antibody titers in 5 mice successfully treated with rhMBL are shown on the indicated days after initial and repeat challenges with Ebola virus.",
