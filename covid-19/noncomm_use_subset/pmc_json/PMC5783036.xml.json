Moreover, a concerted effort is underway to ensure that the IHR requirements are an integral part of essential public health operations and to better embed them into WHO\u2019s health systems strengthening work. This is to ensure that the IHR (2005) core capacity requirements are integral to national health systems, rather than seen as a top-down set of externally imposed stipulations.",

The result was a new articulation of the IHR in 2005 that widened the scope of coverage to include all events (including chemical and nuclear hazards) that could lead to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC).

The 2014 Ebola outbreak again put the IHR (2005) to the test. And subsequent assessments, including WHO\u2019s own commissioned review by the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel,8 identified a number of failures\u2014most notably that WHO reacted slowly with poor communication, also indicating that the organisation and IHR State Parties did not act on the H1N1 review recommendations.

For instance, the USA employs a public health legal preparedness (PHLP) framework, which represents a legal imperative for multisectoral action in emergencies.18 While the US framework was borne of the need to serve a federal structure, there is a need for something similar in countries in order to formally mandate obligatory multisectoral responses in support of health system emergency preparedness and the IHR (2005). And while this cannot necessarily eliminate the potential for domestic political factors to impede IHR (2005) compliance\u2014 as was the case with both the H1N1 pandemic and Ebola outbreak\u2014such a meso-level bottom-up approach can help to ensure an adequate response and make the case for greater compliance. This is in line with calls from civil society for a \u2018socialisation\u2019 of the IHR (2005),19 the need for strong intervention at and with community level20 and the need to confer national ownership to countries. A stronger implementation of the IHR (2005), both in terms of its embedding into the fabric of health systems and into national law, potentially supported via an external funding source,21 could facilitate improved and timely detection and response to health threats, and governance more widely.",

Towards such an objective, Article 44 of the IHR (2005) on \u2018collaboration and assistance\u2019, requires WHO, to the extent possible, to work with other international bodies and networks, and this could be further leveraged in a more proactive manner.",

When the health system is capable of preventing, detecting or effectively addressing a public health threat, the greatest beneficiary is society at large.

Thus, the messaging around investing in health security needs to be less on the tools and procedures and more on the \u2018destination\u2019, for example, a safer world such that public health emergencies do not spread globally and have limited if any impact on international travel, trade and the economy.",

Moreover, they need to be able to rapidly transform such data into information for real-time decision-making. All of this implies a good integration of data sources and systems, involving surveillance, clinical and laboratory services, alert functions, evidence synthesis and communication activities, census results, observational data and health system resources data. Continuing improvement of incident management systems requires the integration and standardisation of information and reporting requirements so that they are in place during emergency responses. Most countries already have some type of public health surveillance system that measures disease burden and mortality/morbidity trends in order to guide programmes and resources, along with an early warning and response system for public health threats. Integrating the IHR (2005) requirements into such systems, and creating or strengthening them where they are weak or non-existent, is a necessity.",

This is also key in the pursuit of UHC. The message from the US Institute of Medicine is that as health threats require the deployment of the same skills and infrastructure that support routine healthcare, investing in strong and resilient health systems facilitates their emergency response capacity.30 Likewise, the GHRF Commission stresses the need to invest in national health systems to ensure a robust global health risk framework13 and civil society too has pressed home this point.20 Additionally, it should not be forgotten that public health crises also carry economic, development and social consequences that could be mitigated by better health system investment upfront. The World Bank estimated the economic impact of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone through 2015 at US$2.2 billionix; the majority of which were economic impacts that disproportionately affected the poor. WHO itself has consistently stated that health systems are at the heart of how countries respond to new disease threats, and sustained investment to keep them strong is required.16 Ultimately, investing in stronger and more resilient health systems is investing in health security and towards UHC.31 32\n",
