Many things factor into transportation stress to include transport management, climatic factors (temperature, humidity, gases and so on), handling methods and facilities, feed and water deprivation, and so on.1 An animal\u2019s response to the effects of transportation stress creates a complex interaction between neurons and hormones. The results of such interactions are manifested clinically (Minka and Ayo)2 by changes in physical (external changes), haematological, biochemical and hormonal parameters (internal changes) of the body.3 In general, the biochemical changes due to transportation stress include a decrease in glucose concentrations, and an increase in non-esterified free fatty acid, muscle enzymes (such as creatine kinase),4 5 packed cell volume (PCV)6 and serum protein.3 4 Due to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),1 researchers have also reported marked changes in cortisol and catecholamine in different stages of transportation.6 7\n",

Bangladesh is a tropical country where temperature (average 30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) and humidity (average 60\u201385 per cent) become higher during the summer season. Most days are very hot and the UV exposure is high. Animal transporters attempt to move animals under adverse weather conditions and this can be detrimental to the animals. Various cruel practices such as rough handling, high stocking density, transport in high temperature, humidity and so on are different forms of welfare violations that have been observed, and these practices increase the risk of muscle injury and fatigue.13 In a nutshell, transportation stress results in multidirectional effects that include body injuries, bodyweight shrinkage and degradation of meat quality.14 Transportation can also decrease immunity, increase infectious diseases susceptibility and eventually result in the death of an animal. Therefore, the current study investigated the health conditions, and the extent and pattern of cattle injuries, along with haemato-biochemical and hormonal changes, before and after long-distance transportation (\u2248648 km) from the market of origin to the market of destination.",

The Benapole LCM was chosen because of its proximity to the Indian border with southern Bangladesh and the potential for trade of different exotic (imported from India) cattle breeds (Bos indicus) like Hariana, Hallikar, Gir, Ongole and Tharparkar. During the peak season (August to September), just before Eid-Ul-Adha, a big festival for the Muslim community in Bangladesh when people sacrifice animals to satisfy God, between 20,000 and 25,000 cattle are legally or illegally imported each day from India to Bangladesh.15 Haat days, or trading days, at Benapole LCM run on Saturday and Tuesday of each week. This market is the largest of its kind in the south-western region of Bangladesh. On any given haat day, around 15,000\u201320,000 cattle are kept on the market, while on average nearly 10,000 cattle are sold.16\n",

The present study was conducted between July and December 2015, where the fieldwork was performed between August and September 2015, which corresponded to the peak season of cattle trade in Bangladesh. Four different single-decker trucks of the same size (body size: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height: 25 feet \u00d7 9 feet \u00d7 3.5 feet) and from the same vehicle manufacturer (Nitol Tata Company) were used for transporting the animals during the study period.

The space allocation for each animal in the vehicle was 8\u201310 square feet on average per animal. Therefore, the space allocation in the vehicle restricted the animals from lying down, so they remained standing the entire transportation period. The floor of the truck was wooden and the cattle were transported without any bedding materials. The surrounding walls of the vehicles were made of iron. The transportation vehicles did not have ceilings or roof coverings; therefore the cattle were exposed to different weather conditions, such as sunlight or rain. For around half this distance, roads are often damaged with potholes, or are very uneven, which can cause sudden jerks or shaking movements of the truck during transportation. No provision of food and water was made for the animals during transportation. However, the animals were provided with paddy straw (the dried paddy plant after removal of matured seeds) and water before the start (30 minutes or 1 hour) and immediately after the end of transport. Paddy straw and water were also the sole feed for cattle for the next 24 hours when the authors collect blood samples at 24 hours after arrival in the destination market.",

Comparisons of the quantitative parameters of serum and blood analysis between before (0 hour) and after transportation (13.8\u00b10.9 hours and 37.8\u00b10.9 hours) were performed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc tests for assessing pairwise comparison. The paired t test was also applied to assess the mean values of cortisol between before and after transportation. The variations of different parameters were considered significant when the P values were <0.05. The results are expressed as frequency number, percentage, mean and sd. As the floor and wall characteristics, space for animals, provision of feed and water, and other management aspects of transportation were very similar between vehicles, no confounding effect by type of transportation vehicle was therefore expected on the occurrence of outcomes. Therefore, the transport vehicle was not considered as a confounder in the statistical analysis. Transport/vehicle was not considered as a clustered variable because animals within each vehicle were not assumed as homogeneous. Therefore, no random effect of transport was expected in data analysis.",
