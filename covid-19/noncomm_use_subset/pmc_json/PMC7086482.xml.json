Phylogenetic studies of the new virus showed it shared about 79% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV4\u20137, as well as to two SARS-like coronaviruses isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Zhoushan, with which it shared 89% nucleotide homology3,5\u20138, and to a third SARS-like coronavirus from an Intermediate horseshoe bat (R. affinis), with which it shared 96% nucleotide homology4,9.

The outbreak clearly began epidemiologically at the Wuhan market, and a number of environmental samples from around the live animal section of the market were subsequently found to be positive for SARS-CoV-212, but based on current evidence, it may not have actually emerged in the market. The earliest recognised case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was an elderly and infirm man who developed symptoms on 1 December 2019. None of his family members became infected, and the source of his virus remains unknown13. Furthermore, 14 of the first 41 cases had no contact with the seafood market13. In another report, five of the first seven cases of COVID-19 had no link to the seafood market14. Thus, it seems very likely that the virus was amplified in the market, but the market might not have been the site of origin nor the only source of the outbreak. A recent phylo-epidemiological study has suggested that the virus was circulating but unrecognised in November, and was imported to the seafood market from elsewhere, where it subsequently was amplified15.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known to be the cell receptor for SARS-CoV, and also for some SARS-like bat coronaviruses16. Sequence studies found that the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was sufficiently similar to that of SARS-CoV to indicate it could efficiently use the human ACE2 receptor for entry to human cells6,7. Infectivity experiments were undertaken with HeLa cells expressing or not expressing ACE2 from humans, bats, civets, pigs and mice, and the results confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 virus was able to use entry receptors on all ACE2-expressing cells other than mice5. Molecular modelling has indicated that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2 may be even higher than that of SARS-CoV and it may therefore be more efficient at infecting human cells17. Evidence from the sequence analyses clearly indicates that the reservoir host of the virus was a bat, probably a Chinese or Intermediate horseshoe bat, and it is probable that, like SARS-CoV, an intermediate host was the source of the outbreak. To ensure that future cross-species transmission events of this new virus don\u2019t occur again in the future, it is important to identify the reservoir and intermediate wildlife hosts. The closest known wildlife sequence to SARS-CoV-2 remains the sequence from the virus isolated from an Intermediate horseshoe bat, but there were significant differences in the receptor-binding domain between the two viruses. Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) have been suggested as potential intermediate hosts, and SARS-like viruses have been identified in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China, but they only shared about 85\u201392%% homology with SARS-CoV-218. No other possible intermediate wildlife host has been proposed at this time.",

Interestingly, this was the first time that NGS had alerted the world to a new zoonotic virus before the virus had been isolated, and it suggests that a new procedure for reporting outbreaks based on NGS rather than pathogen isolation and identification needs to be considered19. The resulting information flow was a great improvement over the experience with SARS-CoV in 2003, but it is important to continue improving this as the lack of the earliest possible information about the sequences slowed down the development of diagnostics and preparedness capacity. This lack of early information may have extended to case notifications, as no cases were reported between 1 and 17 January 2020, but modelling suggested there may have been over 450 cases unreported in that time20, and indeed a number of such cases were subsequently confirmed retrospectively14.",

            "text": "Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely shown in health care, community and family settings. The dominant mode of transmission is from the respiratory tract via droplets or indirectly via fomites, and to a lesser extent via aerosols. In addition, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect the human gastrointestinal tract21,22, it has been suggested that faecal-oral spread may occur for SARS-CoV-223. The reproduction number (Ro) is generally thought to be between 2.0 and 2.820,24\u201327, although higher reproduction numbers have been suggested in some reports. The mean incubation time appears to be between 4.75 and 7 days20,23,24,26,28, ranging from 3 days to an upper limit of around 11\u201314 days. There is increasing knowledge about the virus load. In one study of symptomatic patients, higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset, with the viral loads higher in the nose than in the throat. In a single asymptomatic patient, the viral load was similar to the symptomatic patients29. In a second and more detailed study, the virus load was investigated over consecutive days in two patients from the time of their hospitalisation, with serial samples throat swabs, sputum, urine and stools. The viral loads peaked around 5\u20136 days after symptom onset, with 104 to 107 copies/mL. The authors also studied the viral loads in throat swabs, sputum and stool samples in other patients, and found viral loads were as high as 1011 copies/mL in throat samples, but with a median of 7.99 \u00d7 104, and 7.52 \u00d7 105 in sputum. In addition, virus was detected by RT-PCR in stools from 9 of 17 confirmed cases, but at titres lower than in respiratory samples30. Several studies have indicated that transmission may occur during the incubation period31,32 and from asymptomatic or very mild infections29,33,34.",

There is some evidence that virus can be isolated from saliva36 and while the initial family cluster found no evidence of virus in stools or urine8, it has since been detected in faeces by PCR in other patients30,37,38 and cultured in one patient, but there has been no evidence of virus in urine. The number of mild or asymptomatic cases has not been determined and relatively few cases have been recorded, but it is probable that current figures only see the tip of the iceberg, and many cases remain undiagnosed19. They pose the greatest threat for increased virus spread27. Information is also needed on the stability of the virus in the environment to better determine transmission risks, and especially the survival of the virus in aerosols and on hard surfaces under different conditions of temperature and humidity.",

In addition, there are several commercially available assays with claimed capacity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 that are also being evaluated. Virus can be found in the upper respiratory tract in nearly all patients beginning at or just before the onset of clinical illness29. The preferred samples are combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and if they have a productive cough, also sputum. In patients with lower respiratory tract infections, virus may be detectable in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples even if undetectable in the upper respiratory tract. Virus can be cultured relatively easily in a number of cell lines, including Vero cells, but requires a PC3 containment laboratory. Virus identification can be confirmed by sequencing if necessary, and a large number of partial and whole genome sequences are available via GISAID and GenBank. PCR tests have become increasingly available since about 25 January, but due to the rapid spread in China and the huge number of cases access to timely and accurate testing has been problematic, especially in the early stages, making it difficult to ascertain the true extent of virus infections and illness42.",

Australia\u2019s response has been similar, and to date has been moderately successful in limiting the number of chains of transmission in NSW, Queensland and Victoria, whereas most cases elsewhere have been in returning travellers or their close contacts. Table 1 shows cumulative cases in Hubei, elsewhere in China, and in other countries on a weekly basis between 21 January and 9 March, and shows the rapid rise in cases in China, particularly in Hubei Province, followed by a slowing down over the past 2 weeks, and a continuing rise in cases outside China with more and more countries reporting cases. As of 9 March, 105 countries had reported cases, but only three countries accounted for nearly 75% of the cases; South Korea with 7382 cases, Italy with 7375 cases, and Iran with 6566, and cases have been reported from all continents except Antarctica45. It has been suggested that up to half of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, and that 40% of travellers, largely asymptomatic, mild or pre-symptomatic travellers, were not detected at airports, potentially resulting in multiple chains of as yet undetected human-to-human transmission outside mainland China46,47. Although WHO finally called the COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March, in many respects it had already begun. This was presaged by the observation that more new cases were reported from the rest of the world than from China for the first time on 28 February, and in addition, secondary and tertiary chains of transmission have been reported in increasing numbers of countries. The Australian Government has already recognised this, and has instituted its emergency response plan and is now operating on the basis that the pandemic is here.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and the third zoonotic virus after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Bats are the reservoir hosts of a number of additional novel coronaviruses, particularly Chinese horseshoe bats, and a number of these novel coronaviruses can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor, human ACE2, and replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titres equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV48,49. This indicates that other potential cross-species events could occur in the future. There is therefore a strong reason to ban unregulated wild animal sales in Chinese wet markets, particularly exotic species, both from a public health perspective and for ecological reasons. Such a ban would be difficult to instigate for cultural reasons, but China\u2019s top legislative committee on 24 February 2020, passed a proposal to ban all trade and consumption of wild animals. If this is legislated as a permanent ban, it might help reduce the risk of another novel virus emerging from wildlife in China in the future.",
