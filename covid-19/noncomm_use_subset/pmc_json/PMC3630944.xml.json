His research finding is life-saving. His clinical service changed the perception of the Chinese people to Western medicine. He laid the foundations for medical education in Hong Kong for the centuries to come. We trace the footsteps of Manson who adventured into the tropics, also known as white men's grave in those days, and how he became the indisputable founder of modern tropical medicine.",

His mother, Elizabeth Livingstone, was a distant relative of the great explorer and Christian missionary of Africa, Mr David Livingstone. Manson, as he used to mock himself as \u2018Scandinavian pirate' owing to his Norwegian descent, was described as a dull but curious child. Among his Presbyterian Christian family, he was noticed to have a good memory for being able to memorize the church sermons at the age of 5 years. As he grew up, he was noted for his interest in carpentry, mechanics, cricket and hunting with shotguns. A minor incident foretelling his career was his shooting and dissection of a lean and ferocious cat which yielded a tapeworm inside. However, his initial enthusiasm for mechanics led to his apprenticeship as an ironsmith at the age of 15 years. His will power was obviously much stronger than his physique; he soon developed a spinal curvature and right arm paresis after working for the same hours as other adult ironsmiths. Being medically certified as invalid, he had to give up engineering which turned out to be a blessing in disguise when he switched to biological science. His personal experience of illness and disability might have contributed to his decision to go into medicine, a caring profession.",

As he finished his medical curriculum at the age of 20 years which was too young for graduation, he had to spend another year in reading and visiting hospitals, schools and museums before he formally graduated in 1865. He then worked for 7 months as an assistant medical officer at a lunatic asylum in Durham during which time he performed 17 postmortem dissections on patients with psychiatric illnesses for his Doctor of Medicine thesis. He reasoned in his thesis that the severity of the brain pathology in these patients correlates with the diameter of their aneurismal internal carotid artery, which is similar to the situation of a cirrhotic liver and the dilated portal vein due to portal hypertension.1",

He sailed for 3 months from London across the Cape of Good Hope, Madagascar, and finally arrived at Takao (present day Kaohsiung) of Formosa. His official daily duty was to inspect the ships calling at the port, treat their crew and keep the meteorological record. He also attended to Chinese patients in a local missionary hospital where he was exposed to a wide variety of illnesses from elephantiasis to leprosy for his postgraduate training without any supervision. His only research tool was a combination of clinical skill, hand lens and good record keeping. He took pride in fishing out leeches from the nose of patients painlessly by soaking and relaxing the leeches with hypertonic saline. He successfully treated European patients who developed tropical liver after too much meat and wine (probably fatty liver) with a prescription of heavy exercise and dietary discretion. However, he was quite disappointed by the death of a young Chinese patient presenting with heart failure who died the next day following his treatment. The patient was not improving after weeks of treatment by a traditional Chinese doctor. Later he realized that this and many similar patients were suffering from beriberi as a result of vitamin B1 deficiency only after many years.2 While he became more and more confident with his successes, he also became humbler and wiser with each of his failures.",

The inhabitants were in extreme poverty who subsisted on rice and sweet potatoes occasionally flavoured with vegetable pickles and salted fish.

In 1877, he excised one ton of tissue from patients with elephantiasis, with only 2 deaths out of 61 operations done under chloroform anaesthesia and without support by blood transfusions and antibiotics. Many of these patients could not find a job because of their grotesquely disfigured and enlarged lower limbs and scrotums. They were abandoned by their families because of the financial burden or the superstition about demon possession. In one instance, he encountered a 19-year-old man badly affected by a huge elephantoid tumour who attempted suicide by swallowing arsenic but failed because the excessive dose of poison caused gastric irritation leading to early emesis of the poison. He agreed to be operated by Manson because he did not mind to be killed anyway. This successful operation by Manson earned him reputation and the gradual acceptance of Western medicine by the local Chinese. Besides elephantiasis, he has relieved many patients suffering from the distressing colics due to renal, ureteric and bladder stones by surgical lithotomies. Despite these achievements, he was modest in describing himself as a good carpenter but an indifferent surgeon.",

He designed the Manson's trocar and cannula for the single-handed blind exploration and treatment of deep seated liver abscess. The trocar and cannula produced at a local ironsmith in Amoy can be fitted to a stylet and perforated drainage tube which could be used for the exploration of hidden liver abscess in the absence of organ imaging and many other surgical conditions (Figure 1).

Western doctors were also accused of harvesting the eyes and hearts of Chinese patients for potions, and of drugging and raping Chinese women. Manson soon noticed that traditional Chinese doctors took the history, examined the pulse and tongue of patients, and prescribed in full view in an open street. Taking into account the patients' psychology, he modified his operating theater so that street onlookers and relatives could peep through wide glass windows to watch his operations. The whole process of putting the patient under anaesthesia, painlessness of the surgical procedure, removal of tumours and stones and the recovery from anaesthesia were open to the public. His sharp observation, humanistic concern and adaptive attitude are keys to his success in winning the locals over to western medicine.",

Despite his daring personality and meticulous surgical skills, he was a conscientious surgeon who did not touch the eye till he had acquired such specialist skill in London. While searching for the most updated information on tropical diseases and entomology, he was quite disappointed to find that such information was scarce and poorly organized. However, he bumped onto the work of Timothy Lewis in the British Museum Library on the finding of a microscopic nematode worm, Filaria sanguinis hominis (Filaria nocturna, Wuchereris bancrofti), in the chylous urine and blood of an Indian patient suffering from chyluria.5 This struck Manson as he had operated on many cases of elephantiasis who also had chyluria.

The interesting observation was that such sheathed and vigorously active microfilariae remained unchanged in the blood at body temperature, but then escaped from the sheath at tropical room temperature. He traced the changes of microfilariae in the alimentary tract of female Culex fatigans (Culex quinquefasciatus) mosquitoes fed with infected human blood.6 After dissecting hundreds of such mosquitoes, Manson found that the microfilariae underwent unsheathing and metamorphosis from the alimentary tract to the thoracic muscles of mosquitoes. In 1899, Thomas Bancroft demonstrated that these infected mosquitoes can inoculate the parasite back to human by biting.7 Finally, Manson and others successfully discovered the adult worms of W. bancrofti with all stages of microfilariae in their uterus within the lymphatics of patients suffering from elephantiasis. Thus, the complete life cycle of filariasis in humans and mosquitoes was described, which clearly illustrates how human-to-human transmission occurs through the mosquito vector.",

He coughed out blood-stained sputum which missed the spittoon and fell onto Manson's office carpet. Manson picked up the sputum and found large operculated eggs under his microscope (Figure 4). When these were put in water jars, they hatched into ciliated creatures after 2 weeks at tropical room temperature.9 Manson later found that this fluke Paragonimus westermanii (Distoma ringeri) in the postmortem examination of a patient suffering from endemic haemoptysis with large operculated eggs in the sputum. He proposed that this lung fluke should have an intermediate host in fresh water crustaceans such as snails for the completion of its life cycle. His hypothesis was finally proven in 1916 by Nakagawa.10 His fresh water snail theory was later applied successfully to schistosomiasis. Manson has made many important contributions to tropical diseases including the discovery of Filaria demarquaii (Mansonella ozzardi), Filaria diurna (Loa loa), Filaria perstans (Mansonella perstans), the tapeworm Bothriocephalus mansoni (Spirometra [Diphyllobothrium] mansonoides), Schistosoma mansoni, and the dermatophytic fungus Trichophyton concentricum which causes tinea imbricata.11,12,13 The identification of these organisms as human pathogens has provided the basis for the current management and prevention of these infections.",

He set up a very successful private medical practice which attracted many Europeans and rich Chinese patients. Besides operating at the Civil Hospital for Europeans, he and Sir Ho Kai founded the Alice Memorial Hospital with the support from the London Missionary Society. This hospital served Chinese patients and was also the teaching hospital for the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese which is the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He was the founding dean who gave his inaugural speech on 1 October 1887 at the City Hall, during which Manson emphasized the role of the college in medical education to fight ignorance, superstition and outdated traditions of the feudal Ching Dynasty, the popularization of Western medical practice to ease suffering and its future contributions of research to advance scientific truth for the Chinese and the world. This college will reinvigorate the 0.3 billion of industrious thrifty, persevering and clever Chinese people who invented printing, gunpowder and smallpox inoculation. He also highlighted the importance of a correct attitude in the process of education on science and medicine, that \u2018high personal character, a reputation for wisdom, humility, honesty and kindness will often do more to recommend our wares (scientific & medical knowledge) than any quality in the wares themselves'.3 The first batch of Chinese medical graduates from this college included the father of the new China, Dr Yat-Sen Sun. It is interesting to note that the Alice Memorial Hospital served as the meeting place for Dr Sun and his revolutionary comrades. In the spring of 1923, Dr Sun made a visit to the HKU at the invitation of the Students' Union, and delivered his historic speech at the now Loke Yew Hall to more than 400 guests. Dr Sun began his speech by saying that, \u2018I feel as though I have returned home, because Hong Kong and the HKU are my intellectual birthplace'.",

Due to such gaps in training, there was often wastage of quinine for non-malarial fever. His philosophy towards the judicious use of antimicrobials is even more important in the present era of rising antimicrobial resistance. Though newly recognized clinical entities such as tropical (fatty) liver could be easily be treated by heavy exercise and dietary (food and alcoholic beverages) discretion, there was no portal of sharing on such important knowledge between doctors till the founding of this medical society.",

He obtained his membership of Royal College of Physicians by examination in 1889 and became the physician to the Seamen's hospital at Dreadnought for 6 years. He was a strong advocate on the necessity for special education in tropical medicine. In an introductory address delivered at the St George Hospital of London, he said, \u2018the course of instruction in general medicine usually received in this country is utterly inadequate to qualify for tropical practice. I say so emphatically, basing my assertion on my own experience, my own mistakes, and what I have seen and still daily see of the mistakes of others'.29 This led to strong repercussions from his colleagues and he had to leave Dreadnought. Though he had to pay the price of honesty and conviction by resignation, he was then given a teaching post for tropical diseases at the Albert Dock Seaman Hospital in 1901. But with time, people were more and more convinced of the necessity of tropical medicine, Manson founded the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1899. At the age of 55 years, Manson had to spend 3 h per round trip and travelled 9 miles to the school two to three times per week for his teaching duties. Similar to most eminent scientists, he was always concerned with how to induce continuous interest in future generations to make keen observations in patients and pursue effective control of infectious diseases.",

Global programmes in vector control remain the mainstay in the control and eradication of malaria, filariasis and dracunculiasis;30,31,32 22.8% of emerging infectious diseases since 1940 are vector-borne diseases.33 Control of arthropod vector-borne diseases includes chemical and biological means, as well as by reducing contact between human and vectors. The best example is the control of mosquitoes, which includes the reduction of the mosquito population by environmental modifications, larvicides and adulticides, and the prevention of mosquito\u2013human contact with medicated bed-nets and insect repellants. Alternative biological control strategies under investigation to reduce insecticide resistance and ecological side effects include the use of a bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia to inhibit the replication of the Plasmodium in mosquitoes, entomopathogenic fungi and genetically-modified mosquitoes.34,35,36 Our understanding of the life cycle of flukes provides the basis for control programmes of schistosomiasis in China, which mainly aims to minimize contacts of snails from excreta of humans or cattle.37 Though the incidence of paragonimiasis has been reduced substantially with education programmes and mass chemotherapy,38 it is the control of the vector population and reduction in human\u2013arthropod contacts that are most practicable and sustainable. The importance of vector-borne diseases extends beyond parasites. Mosquitoes transmit many viruses that cause epidemics, such as yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya virus. The problem of vector-borne disease is further aggravated by climate change. The geographical range of arthropod-borne infections has expanded in recent years in both latitude and altitude.39 For example, chikungunya virus, which was previously limited to tropical countries, has now been found in Italy.40 Many newly described emerging infections also require a vector, for example the new phleboviruses41,42 and Ehrlichia.43",

His long period of stay in the tropics posed significant risk to his health and safety. He has set the personal example of excellence in clinical service, medical education and microbial research. His scientific contributions on the importance of vector control to interrupt the life cycle of many tropical disease agents make him well deserved of the title of Father of Tropical Medicine. In the year 2000, the World Health Organization launched a global campaign for eliminating lymphatic filariasis which would not have been possible without the firm foundation laid down by Manson.31 His contribution to China did not end after leaving China. In 1896, he helped Dr James Cantlie in saving Dr Yat-Sen Sun from the kidnap and imprisonment by secret agents of the Ching Dynasty in London. If not for their effort, Dr Sun might have been executed, and China may not have been liberated from the feudal Ching Dynasty in 1911. In the pursuit of science and medicine, Manson emphasized that most mistakes do not come from not knowing in medicine, but from not looking. It is not the microscope, but the eyes that look through it that counts. Additionally, never refuse to see what you do not want to see, for it is often the finger pointing towards discovery.",
