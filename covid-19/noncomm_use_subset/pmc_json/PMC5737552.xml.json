An example of the former is selection for reverse transcriptase-mediated multiple alternative base substitutions to lead to pathogen surface variability to evade host defenses (1). A different type of productive non-standard polymerase action involves realignment of the template:product hybrid at a slippage-prone sequence to yield product with extra or fewer base(s) than present in the corresponding template sequence (2). This has been studied with DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases, RTs).",

Dissociation of the nascent RNA from its template hybrid complement allows realigned pairing in either direction. A well known Paramyxovirus heteropolymeric slippage motif is composed of A\u2019s followed by G\u2019s with the identity of the mis-paired base in the new re-aligned hybrid being important in determining slippage directionality (30,31). Nearly all work has focused on slippage involving a linear (unstructured) template. However, there is evidence that a protein roadblock or template structure ahead of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribing a slippage motif can stimulate realignment (2,32,33). Also there is one report of roadblock-mediated RT slippage where a polymerase bypasses an RNA-structure forming sequence prior to resumption of synthesis (34). The present work does not explore RT generation of product lacking sequence complementary to template sequence present in RNA structure.",

However, RTs do not contain 3\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity and their templates are prone to form structures at the ambient temperature at which these enzymes act. Better reagent polymerases have been developed from thermophilic DNA-dependent DNA polymerases by adapting their catalytic activity to function with RNA templates (39\u201341), or derived from existing RT polymerase by genetic engineering (42).

These specified the WT, or a variant, of the \u2018model\u2019 RNA stem\u2013loop structure 5\u2032 adjacent to 7A\u2019s. The first construct \u2018wtSL-A7\u2019 has the WT sequence specifying the \u2018model\u2019 stem\u2013loop 5\u2032-GCGGGCgcaaGCCCGC-3\u2032, with the potential of base pairing indicated in upper case. The second \u2018MUTsl-A7\u2019 has the 5\u2032 side sequence of the stem substituted by complementary nt bases, i.e. from 5\u2032-GCGGGC-3\u2032 to 5\u2032-CGCCCG-3\u2032 to prevent potential formation of the model stem\u2013loop structure (Figure 1A and B). RT reactions were performed with all dNTP equimolar at 500 \u03bcM. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase to yield the \u2018RT-PCR products\u2019. The controls for Taq polymerase slippage used two chemically synthetized 75 nt DNAs, whose sequence corresponds to that of the test RNA sequence, used as template for PCR amplification. This yields the \u2018PCR products\u2019 referred to below. Next, the two RT-PCR and the two PCR products were used as templates for Limited Primer Extension (LPE) analysis for detecting the addition or omission of a base(s) in the T/A-tract derived sequence. LPE reactions were performed with one primer whose sequence is complementary to the template sequence adjacent to the T-tract present in one of the two strands of the RT-PCR and PCR products [the other DNA strand has the corresponding A-tract]. The conditions of the LPE reaction enable the primer to be extended to the first template base position at which termination was arranged to occur by incorporation of an acyclic dGTP (acyGTP) base. This leads to efficient termination at the first base C of the template encountered by the polymerase during extension of the primer as the corresponding dGTP standard substrate is absent from the reaction (see Materials and Methods). The C at which LPE termination occurs is 5\u2032 adjacent to the T-tract (other sites and acyclic dNTPs are used as controls in Supplementary Data). The length of the LPE product also depends on the occurrence of any indel in the T-tract motif. In absence of slippage of the DNA polymerases used for amplification of the chemically synthesized DNA (Taq polymerase control) and subsequently for generation of the LPE product (Vent exo\u2212 polymerase), a homogeneous length LPE product is expected. This is used as a length marker. Comparison of the pattern of the LPE product(s) generated from RT-PCR with the marker reveal specific RT polymerase slippage-mediated base indels (Figure 1C).",

To assess whether this also pertains with Reverse Transcriptase realignment, different dNTP concentration ratios were assayed. Nine dNTP ratio combinations with 5, 50 or 500 \u03bcM for the dTTP (specified by the A-tract slippage motif) and 5, 50 or 500 \u03bcM for the dGTP (specified 5\u2032 adjacent to the template motif) were tested; the dATP and dCTP substrates were each present at 500 \u03bcM. Presence of the \u2018model\u2019 WT stem\u2013loop stimulated addition of T (Figure 1D, lanes 4\u20139); this stimulation was increased with higher dTTP concentrations and higher ratios of [dTTP]:[dGTP] (Figure 1D, compare lane sets 1\u20133, 4\u20136 and 7\u20139). In the absence of the \u2018model\u2019 stem\u2013loop, base omission of T was predominant. The most stimulatory dNTP condition was the lower ratio, 1:100, of [dTTP]:[dGTP], (Figure 1D, lane 12). At the highest dTTP concentration tested, a modest level of base addition is also observed but only at the highest ratio of [dTTP]:[dGTP] (lane 16). These results indicate that the RNA stem\u2013loop is a strong stimulator for RT SuperScript\u2122 III realignment directionality, promoting addition of an extra T in the cDNA, but not the omission of a T. Interestingly, in absence of the RNA stem\u2013loop structure, realignment directionality is the inverse. This directionality difference indicates that the RNA stem\u2013loop is also a strong inhibitor for omission of a base complementary to a template base. In summary, realignment efficiency and directionality is influenced by the relative dNTP concentrations and by RNA template structure.",

We first identified the minimal number of nucleotides 5\u2032 of an A7 motif at which formation of the model stem\u2013loop could stimulate slippage. Base C 5\u2032 adjacent to the motif was maintained in all sequences. Derivatives of the \u2018wtSL-A7\u2019 construct were made with 1, 2 or 3 nt insertions between the stem\u2013loop and the A-tract motif (Supplementary Figure S2, panel A). The LPE results showed that by increasing the distance between the model stem\u2013loop and the A7 tract by just one nt, the stimulatory effect of the RNA stem\u2013loop structure on base addition is abolished. The results also show that the inhibitory effect of the stem\u2013loop on base omission is abolished as well. Base omission is now more sensitive to dNTP concentration ratio variation. This is most evident with a higher concentration of the dGTP substrate (specified by the template base 5\u2032 adjacent to the A-tract motif), than that of the dTTP substrate (specified by the slippage motif) (Supplementary Figure S2A and C). The results with E. coli RNA polymerase generated RNA, showed that the model stem\u2013loop 5\u2032 adjacent to an A5 motif does not, at equimolar dNTP, stimulate SuperScript\u2122 III-mediated base addition (data not shown). Interestingly, similar experiments using derivative constructs specifying the model stem\u2013loop 0, 1, 2, or 3 nt 5\u2032 to A5 motif, showed that though the RNA stem\u2013loop does not stimulate base addition on A5, its inhibitory effect on base omission is present when the model stem\u2013loop is 5\u2032 adjacent to the A5 (Supplementary Figure S2B and C).

Also in the WT construct a compensatory base substitution was made in the sequence specifying the 5\u2032 base of the 5\u2032 side of the stem to maintain base pairing (Figure 4A). In the MUT construct a corresponding substitution to preclude base pairing was not necessary as its potential partner is already G (Figure 4B). The second set of constructs \u2018wtSL/U-A7\u2019 and \u2018MUTsl/U-A7\u2019 is as the first set except for the base adjacent to the motif being C with corresponding compensatory base substitutions (A and U respectively) to maintain (wt), or to abolish (MUT), stem\u2013loop structure formation (Figure 4C and D). RT reactions were performed using three specific dNTP concentration ratios (1:1, 100:1 and 1:100) for the dNTP substrate specified by the slippage motif and the RNA base adjacent to the motif. LPE analysis showed a similar result as obtained with the WT and mut \u2018stem\u2013loop\u2019 model structure where the last base of the sequence specifying the 3\u2032 side of its stem has the base C 5\u2032 adjacent to the A7 motif. The RT slippage followed the dNTP ratio \u2018rules\u2019 where higher substrate concentration specified by the slippage motif stimulates base addition (Figure 4E, lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11), and where higher substrate concentration specified by the template base 5\u2032 adjacent to the motif, stimulates base omission (Figure 4E, lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12). The RT slippage also followed the rules of slippage directionality involving potential formation of the RNA structure 5\u2032 of the motif. With the wtSL constructs, base addition is stimulated, and with the MUTsl constructs it is inhibited (Figure 4E, compare lane sets 1\u20132 with 7\u20138, and 4\u20135 with 10\u201311). In contrast, slippage omission of at least one base is favored in the absence of potential for RNA template stem\u2013loop formation (Figure 4E, compare lane 9 with 3, and lane 12 with 6).

We selected three of these candidates for in vitro testing of TGIRT enzyme slippage during reverse transcription of cassettes. In the two Drosophila melanogaster candidates tested pol was in the \u20131 frame with respect to gag, whereas in the third candidate, which was from maize (Zea mays), its pol was in the +1 frame with respect to gag. Drosophila candidate Dme1_ChrX_2630566 has the motif 5\u2032-AU6-3\u2032 and was tested with a chemically synthetized RNA containing 22 nt 5\u2032 and 26 nt 3\u2032 to the motif (Figure 5,A). Candidate Dme1_Chr3_26087113 has the motif 5\u2032-GA4U4-3\u2032 and the chemically synthetized RNA to test it contained 18 nt 5\u2032 and 32 nt 3\u2032 of the motif (Supplementary Figure S7A and C). To more closely resemble physiological conditions, in these reactions the TGIRT-mediated reverse transcription was performed at room temperature and in low salt buffer (this differed from the 60\u00b0C and higher salt conditions utilized in the switching template experiment above). The RT reaction was performed with a sequence specific primer for each test candidate cassette. Each candidate was tested with 3 specific dNTP ratios (1:1, 100:1 and 1:100) for the dNTP substrate specified by the slippage motif and the RNA base 5\u2032 adjacent to the motif. LPE analysis showed slippage for the candidate Dme1_ChrX_2630566 having the U6 tract in the RNA template: efficiency and distribution follow the dNTP rule for slippage (Figure 5B). Candidate Dme1_Chr3_26087113 showed no slippage (Supplementary Figure S7C).",
