Nevertheless, the population in 1997 doubled compared with 1949 because of the momentum of population growth. According to the 2013 International Statistics Yearbook (4), China has also experienced substantial economic growth over the previous three decades. However, increasing demands or depletions of natural resources are always in companion with the rapid growth of both the population and the national economy.",

According to The National Soil Pollution Condition Survey, reported by the Environmental Protection Department and the Ministry of Land and Resources, the first investigation to assess the extent of soil pollution was conducted between April 2005 and December 2013, and suggested that the national soil condition was bleak. Nationally, soil in 16.2% of the whole landed area was polluted, with inorganic pollutants (e.g. cadmium, mercury, arsenic, copper, lead, chromium, zinc, and nickel) and organic pollutants (e.g. DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) contributing to 82.8 and 3.8%, respectively.

For example, the number of Tibetan antelopes decreased from 200,000 to 20,000 in the 1980s because Tibetan antelope fur was much sought after in markets; thus, the species has become an internationally endangered species. In addition, ecotourism endeavors, such as the highway in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve's dense forest and the Qinghai-Tibet railway, has caused shrinkage and fragmentation of wildlife habitat, wildlife death, and changes in their migratory route, which has brought humans, domestic animals, and wild animals into close contact with each other and subsequently altered disease transmission.

Livestock production currently accounts for 40% of the gross value of agricultural production in China (29). However, livestock and poultry rearing have become the second largest sources of pollution, immediately behind industries. One example is that of the substantial blue-green algae bloom in Tai Lake, which contaminated the drinking water of millions of people; ultimately, animal husbandry is also considered a main source of pollution. It was reported that domestic wastewater was the main source of pollution in the Yangtze Delta, followed by pollution from raising livestock and poultry, and industrial wastewater. Pigs and poultry produced approximately 90% of the total pollutants related to animal husbandry. It has been reported that the daily discharge of sewage from one pig is equivalent to wastewater from seven humans, and 100 pigs produce 10,000 to approximately 30,000 tons of sewage each year, including 107 tons of nitrogen and 31 tons of phosphorus, which drain off into soil and are subsequently converted to nitrate and phosphate, which in turn pollute both soil and water (30). A substantial number of odorous gases produced by poultry rearing, which contain many poisonous and harmful ingredients, such as ammonia, sulfur, and methane, negatively impact the air quality. In addition, the feces of livestock and poultry contain a substantial number of pathogenic microorganisms, including parasites that may spread zoonotic infectious diseases.",

Approximately 71.8% of zoonotic events occurring in humans can be traced to wildlife (43), including AIDS, avian flu, plague, foot and mouth disease, rabies, and dengue fever. Wildlife resources are very abundant in China where more than 5,300 types of vertebrates live (44). These wildlife species differ in their habits and also exist in diverse living environments, and the pathogens they carry are complex, which in turn forms a substantial natural pathogen reservoir. Generally, infected wild animals may not exhibit symptoms; however, they can transmit the pathogens to humans via specific mechanisms. Living environments, such as high-density breeding, make contact between captive wild animals and humans easier, which in turn increases the chance of cross-infection. For example, the avian influenza virus H7N9 has emerged with the capacity of cross-species infection; humans would get infected via exposure to the asymptomatic avian influenza virus and then exhibit a high fatality rate (45). Thus, the frequent trade of wildlife and its products has also increased the risk of infection, which clearly threatens public health.",

Overall, China has become one of the countries worldwide with a major issue of bacterial resistance. The most serious consequence of drug abuse is the emergence of superbugs. Resistant bacteria enter the food chain through animals (e.g. Salmonella through chickens) and are subsequently transmitted to humans. In addition, antimicrobial resistance is one of the main threats to modern medicine.",

Second, professor LU chose rural areas in Henan Province as the research field and conducted a baseline rabies investigation. Based on the baseline, a specific community intervention model of One Health was formulated to analyze the residents exposed to rabies. The findings indicated that with the implementation of the One Health community intervention model, the rabies incidence in the residents decreased by 7.59% compared with the previous incidence, and community dog vaccination increased from 13.9 to 82.5%. Third, a study of dengue fever conducted by the Zhongshan CDC and veterinary departments together with the team of professor LU determined that a negative dengue infection is a potential factor in dengue fever outbreak. These findings indicated that One Health plays a vital role in disease prevention and control.
