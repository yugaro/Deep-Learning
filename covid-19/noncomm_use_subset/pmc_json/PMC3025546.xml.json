            "text": "X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) belongs to the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family of transcription factors. XBP-1 plays a major role in regulating unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is under stress (1). XBP-1 has two protein isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S. Both isoforms share a common N-terminus containing a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain which is required for DNA binding. XBP-1U is the dominant isoform under non-stress conditions. Activation of UPR induces the endoribonuclease activity of inositol requiring enzyme 1, an ER transmembrane protein, which removes 26 nts from the open-reading frame of XBP-1 mRNA (2). This unconventional splicing occurs in cytoplasm and causes a frame shift at amino acid 165 of XBP-1, leading to the generation of XBP-1S by replacing the C-terminus of XBP-1U with a strong transactivation domain (2,3). XBP-1S is a transcription activator that up-regulates the expression of ER chaperones and other genes involved in membrane synthesis and the pathway of protein secretion (4,5). Overexpression of XBP-1S increases the secretory capacity of the cell and improves recombinant protein productivity in secretion-limited mammalian cells by expanding the surface area and volume of ER (5,6). It has been shown recently that high-level expression of recombinant secreted proteins in cells and environmental stresses during culture also induce the generation of XBP-1S (7). XBP-1S is also found to be essential in the terminal differentiation of the antibody producing plasma cells by enhancing the secretory machinery of the cell (8,9). The XBP-1-knockout B cells display impaired immunoglobulin secretion, which can be restored by ectopic expression of XBP-1S (8). Furthermore, the involvement of XBP-1 in tumorigenesis has been reported recently (10\u201312).",

            "text": "Recent studies show that cellular UPR can be induced by infection of various viruses, including Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (13), West Nile virus (14), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (15), hepatitis C virus (16,17), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (18,19), dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) (20), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (21), coronavirus (22), Epstein-Barr virus (23) and Semliki Forest virus (24). Some viruses, such as JEV and DEN-2, use the ER of host cells as the primary site of glycoprotein synthesis, genomic RNA replication and virus particle maturation, and thus trigger ER stress as well as UPR (15,20). In the other case, some viral proteins, such as HCMV US11, traffic to the ER of host cells and induce UPR (18). The transactivator of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Tax, has been shown to be localized in the organelles associated with protein secretion including ER and Golgi complex (25), raising the possibility that HTLV-1 may affect cellular UPR as well. We previously discovered that XBP-1S stimulates basal and Tax-activated transcription of HTLV-1. Infection of HTLV-1 was found to induce UPR and up-regulation the expression of several UPR genes, including XBP-1. Furthermore, XBP-1 was identified as one of the Tax target genes in cells (26). Our results not only revealed a positive feedback loop between HTLV-1 and the host cells, but also suggested an important role for XBP-1 in transcriptional regulation of HTLV-1.",

It has been reported that two histone acetyltransferases (HATs), PCAF and p300, are required to activate HTLV-1 transcription through three 21-bp repeats known as Tax-responsive element (TRE) located with the HTLV-1 promoter (30). Each TRE contains a binding site for CREB/ATF proteins, suggesting a potential functional connection between HATs and XBP-1S. We first investigated the interaction between PCAF and two XBP-1 isoforms. Cells were transfected with an XBP-1S or XBP-1U expression plasmid followed by IP analyses (Figure 1A). The anti-XBP-1 antibody used in the assays can recognize both XBP-1 isoforms. The association between PCAF and another member of CREB/ATF protein family, CREB1, was also examined (Figure 1A). PCAF was found in the immunoprecipitated complexes of XBP-1S expressing cells, but not in XBP-1U or CREB1 expressing cells (Figure 1A). Reciprocal IP was carried out using an anti-PCAF antibody and XBP-1S was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes, confirming the interaction between PCAF and XBP-1S (Figure 1B). Interaction between XBP-1S and another HAT, p300, was examined next. However, no association between p300, XBP-1S, XBP-1U and CREB1 was detected (Figure 1C), indicating a specific binding between PCAF and XBP-1S.\n",

The heavy chains of anti-PCAF antibodies were also recognized by the secondary antibody used for the immunoblotting. Since the molecular weights of heavy chains and HA-tagged XBP-1S were similar (\u223c50 kDa), the blot could not reveal the presence of HA-XBP-1S in the immunoprecipitates. We did another western blot using an anti-XBP-1S antibody recognizing the common domain of XBP-1S and XBP-1U and confirmed the interaction between PCAF and HA-XBP-1S (Figure 2B, the anti-XBP-1 blot). It was noted that the interaction between PCAF and endogenous XBP-1S proteins were also detected in the HA-1S(134\u2013376)- and HA-XBP-1U-transfected cells (Figure 2B). Collectively, the results demonstrate that PCAF binds to XBP-1S through the transcriptional activation domain of XBP-1S located in its C-terminal region.\n",

We next wished to determine if the transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter by PCAF was mediated through ERSE as well. The wild-type and ERSE-mutant BiP-Luc reporter plasmids were utilized in the experiments. Extopic expression of PCAF significantly activated the Luc expression driven by the wild-type BiP promoter, while little or no effects were detected on the transcription driven by the ERSE-mutant BiP promoter (Figure 5A). Since the protein level of endogenous XBP-1S was low in the ER stress-free cells, only up to a 44% increase in BiP transcription was observed (Figure 5A). In the XBP-1S-overexpressing cells, PCAF exhibited stronger activation on the expression of luciferase driven by the wild-type BiP promoter (Figure 5B, up to 3-fold). However, no activating effects on the ERSE mutant BiP promoter were detected when both PCAF and XBP-1S were overexpressed (Figure 5B). Collectively, these results suggest that PCAF interacts with XBP-1S and mediates BiP transcription in an ERSE-dependent manner.\n",

Cells were transfected with a control or PCAF shRNA followed by the treatment of Tm to induce UPR. The mRNAs isolated from the cells were analyzed by QRT\u2013PCR. The mRNA levels of BiP and CHOP increased 4- and 14-fold, respectively, after Tm incubation (Figure 8A).

Little or no significant effects on BiP and CHOP mRNAs were detected in the PCAF shRNA-transfected cells (Figure 8B). We further carried out quantitative ChIP to examine the distribution of XBP-1S and PCAF on BiP and CHOP genes during UPR. Incubation of Tm resulted in 15- and 5-fold increases in XBP-1S binding to BiP and CHOP promoters, respectively, while only 3- and 1.7-fold increases in PCAF associating with the two genes (Figure 8C). In another set of experiments with Tg treatment, <2-fold increases in PCAF binding to endogenous BiP and CHOP genes were detected, while more than 20- (BiP) and 5-fold (CHOP) enhancement in XBP-1S binding (Figure 8D).

Two HATs, PCAF and p300, have been shown to interact with Tax and play a role in Tax-activated viral transcription (26,33\u201335). Tax, which does not bind to DNA by itself, activates HTLV-1 transcription through three 21-bp repeats known as TRE, located within the promoter of HTLV-1. Each 21-bp TRE repeat contains a CREB/ATF binding site and is known to associate with CREB/ATF family proteins (36,37). Tax binds to TREs through the interaction with CREB/ATF family proteins (including XBP-1S, CREB1 and CREB2) and recruits PCAF/p300 to HTLV-1 promoter, resulting in Tax transactivation (26,33\u201335). We previously found that XBP-1S bound to Tax and induced stronger Tax transactivation than other CREB/ATF family proteins (26). Interestingly, XBP-1S also stimulated basal transcription of HTLV-1, while CREB1 and CREB2 did not show any activating effects, suggesting a crucial role for XBP-1S during the early phase of viral transcription as well (26). No interaction between PCAF and CREB1 was detected in Co-IP analyses (Figure 1A). This observation could explain why CREB1 and other CREB/ATF family proteins fail to up-regulate HTLV-1 transcription in the absence of Tax. In contrast, the requirement for PCAF in the XBP-1S-dependent HTLV-1 basal transcription was clearly demonstrated in the cell-based reporter assays (Figures 3A and 4A).",

In addition, quantitative ChIP assays showed that XBP-1S recruited PCAF to the promoters of endogenous XBP-1S target genes in vivo, establishing direct functional connection between PCAF and XBP-1S (Figure 7). However, knockdown of PCAF by siRNA or shRNA did not completely inhibit the elevated transcription caused by XBP-1S (Figures 4 and 6). There are two possible explanations for these observations. First, both siRNA and shRNA against PCAF did not completely block the protein synthesis of PCAF (Figures 4A and 6A). Therefore, it is possible that the siRNA- and shRNA-transfected cells still have sufficient PCAF left to participate in the gene activation by XBP-1S. Secondly, PCAF may be one of the cellular co-factors responsible for XBP-1S-dependent transcription. Therefore, elimination of PCAF by RNA interference could only partially inhibit the transactivation of XBP-1S.",

PCAF has been identified as a co-factor of ATF4 (or CREB2) for the expression of CHOP (38). In response to amino acid starvation, ATF4 binds to the amino acid response element located in the CHOP promoter and recruits PCAF to the promoter, leading to the activation of CHOP transcription (38). Besides PCAF, ATF4 also interacts with other HATs, including p300 and CBP, through its N-terminal transactivation domain (39,40). As shown in Figure 1, XBP-1S shows more stringent protein binding than ATF4 and fails to associate with p300. Future study is required to investigate the interaction between XBP-1S and other HATs to further determine the binding specificity of the XBP-1S transactivation domain. Collectively, the findings by our and other groups point out that PCAF may play an important role in transcriptional activation of CHOP through the XBP-1S- as well as ATF4-dependent pathways.",

Co-overexpression of p300, YY1 and ATF6 showed synergistic activation of luciferase expression driven by the BiP promoter, suggesting that p300 might be required for YY1-/ATF6-mediated activation of BiP (41). Similar cell-based reporter assays (i.e. using the BiP-Luc reporter plasmid) were performed to determine the requirement of p300 for XBP-1S-mediated transactivation. Neither overexpression nor knockdown of p300 showed any significant effects on XBP-1S-dependent luciferase expression (Figures 3 and 4), suggesting that p300 might function in a XBP-1S-independent manner. These results were further supported by Co-IP data, in which no interaction between p300 and XBP-1S was detected (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we assessed the requirement of p300 for transcriptional activation of BiP and CHOP genes under UPR. In contrast to the report by Baumeister et al. (41), our results obtained from the quantitative ChIP analyses did not show any increased p300 binding to either BiP or CHOP promoters in the Tm- or Tg-stressed cells (data not shown), raising the questions regarding to the involvement of p300 in the regulation of XBP-1S target genes.",

However, results from QRT\u2013PCR and quantitative ChIP showed that PCAF only exhibited limited involvement in the expression of XBP-1S target genes when UPR was induced (Figure 8). A recent study identified the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as a novel XBP-1S binding protein and demonstrated that the association between XBP-1S and the PI3K subunit could be UPR-dependent (32). We examined the XBP-1S-PCAF protein\u2013protein interaction under the normal or Tm-stressed conditions. As shown in Figure 9, the interaction between XBP-1S and PCAF was not disrupted during UPR. On-going research focuses on the identification of the XBP-1S co-factor(s) required for the transactivation caused by XBP-1S once UPR is induced. GCN5, a HAT which shares 73% identity in amino acid sequence with PCAF (42), is a possible candidate for XBP-1S binding partner. The involvement of GCN5 in XBP-1S-dependent transcription and during UPR is currently under investigation.",

Recent studies show the involvement of XBP-1 in tumorigenesis of various cancers and suggest XBP-1 as a potential target for anti-cancer therapeutics (10\u201312,43). Fujimoto et al. investigated the expression of XBP-1 in 11 primary breast cancers and five breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7. The increased expression of XBP-1 was detected in all breast cancers and cell lines examined, but not in the non-cancerous breast issue (44). In addition, clinical results showed that high levels of XBP-1S increased the survival of breast cancers (45). Our data presented here demonstrate the functional importance of PCAF in mediating the expression of XBP-1S target genes in MCF7 cells (Figures 6 and 7), suggesting a potential role of PCAF in XBP-1S-mediated tumerigenesis of breast cancers. Furthermore, PCAF may be an essential factor for other XBP-1S-mediated signaling pathways. For example, XBP-1S is one of the key components in the transcriptional program controlling plasma cell differentiation (1). It would be worthwhile to examine the importance of PCAF-XBP-1S during the development of plasma cells.",
