Major reasons causing non-traumatic ONFH include hormone abuse, ethanol overdosage, congenital and other unknown factors. In the spring of 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in most cities of China, and the patients who recovered from SARS suffered mostly from the refractory disease \u2013 ONFH. The incidence of ONFH is \u223c60%\u201370% after SARS treatment, and ONFH mostly occurred in bilateral sides.1 It is thought that post-SARS ONFH is mainly caused by the application of high dosage of glucocorticoid hormones during SARS treatment, though some studies indicated that other reasons might be applicable in those cases.2,3 SARS could be one independent risk factor causing ONFH,4,5 perhaps via mediation by S proteins.6,7",

Some surgeons thus suggested conserving the femoral heads maximally instead of artificial hip joint replacement.

Alendronate drugs can inhibit bone absorption ability of osteoclasts, accelerate osteoclast apoptosis, improve bone volume and bone strength, and facilitate bone healing, thus impeding and retarding ONFH progression, decreasing bone absorption and femoral head collapse, as well as decreasing the frequency of surgery for collapse. Hong et al showed that alendronate is one effective method for treating ONFH and can reduce bone marrow edema.13 However, due to potential side effects including jaw bone necrosis or bone fracture after long-term application of alendronate, some surgeons still prefer surgery approaches.13 Bone et al observed 10-year study on menopausal women and found no significant correlation between alendronate drugs and bone fracture.14 This study performed 12-year alendronate sodium treatment (70 mg weekly) on all post-SARS ONFH patients and found no jaw bone absorption or fracture among all patients. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can alleviate or treat ONFH via enhancing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in subchondral bones of the femoral head and induction of de novo angiogenesis to improve femoral head blood supply. Vulpiani et al found that ESWT could benefit bone reconstruction and regeneration via stimulating vascular growth factor expression.15,16 Wang et al compared ESWT and surgery approach and found that ESWT had significant clinical efficacy and less probability of surgery.17 Lin et al also showed efficacy of ESWT on prednisone treatment-induced ONFH after systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment.18 Ludwig et al reported that 1-year ESWT treatment significantly alleviated pain, improved hip joint function and reduced bone necrosis lesions on ONFH patients at ARCO Phase I to Phase III.19 ESWT helps to treat ONFH mainly via inducing tissue regeneration of mesenchymal and extracellular reactions and inducing femoral head angiogenesis. We performed long-term follow-up on all patients receiving ESWT and showed that ESWT could retard disease worsening and improve clinical symptoms on early phase ONFH patients. Moreover, Camporesi et al performed a 7-year follow-up and showed that 6-week continuous hyperbaric oxygen treatment could significantly improve clinical symptoms of ONFH.20 Hyperbaric oxygen environment can enhance oxygen concentration in blood, thus alleviating oxygen perfusion into bone tissues for reducing bone marrow edema, thus reducing bone pressure, venous drainage and microcirculation. Moreover, hyperbaric oxygen can also stimulate vessel angiogenesis and the function of osteoblast and osteoclast cells, thus providing necessary pre-conditions for treating ONFH. Koren et al performed an 11.1\u00b15.1-year follow-up study and indicated that hyperbaric oxygen was 1 effective method for treating Phase I and Phase II ONFH.21 It is still debatable about the effects of single usage of hyperbaric oxygen to treat post-SARS ONFH. Wu et al22 performed a follow-up on Phase I ONFH of SARS patients and reported that hyperbaric oxygen cannot effectively impede or reverse progression of Phase I ONFH after SARS, while Qiu and Zhang3 attributed hyperbaric oxygen to be a satisfactory method for treating post-SARS ONFH. This study performed regular combined treatment consisting of alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen. By 12-year long-term follow-up, some patients showed clinical improvement of ONFH, while most patients showed retardation of disease progression or even reversion. By statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment, we found significant differences (p<0.05). Therefore, we believe that long-term treatment of combined therapy including alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen could effectively retard ONFH progression, alleviate patient\u2019s clinical symptoms and improve hip joint function, thus decreasing the risk of surgery on post-SARS ONFH patients.",
