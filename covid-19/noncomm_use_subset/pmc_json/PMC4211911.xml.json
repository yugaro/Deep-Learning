A total of 12 items measure the dimension of care, and 13 items measure protection, both on a Likert scale. The care dimension of the PBI reflects parental warmth and involvement in contrast to rejection and indifference. The overprotection dimension of the PBI reflects parental overprotection and control in contrast to the encouragement of autonomy. Higher scores on the care and protection dimensions reveal that participants perceive their parents to be more caring and/or protective.",

Although PBI has shown basic reliability for long periods,20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because PBI is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors. Second, certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits, a history of psychiatric disorders, suicidal behavior, and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior. Third, because the participants in our study are medical students, we cannot generalize these results to general practitioners.",

Participants who have experienced a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide occurs commonly and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide. Although parental bonding predisposes these attitudes toward suicide, educational programs could change caretaking practices.21 To achieve more positive attitudes towards suicidal behavior, promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students. Child rearing support might be associated with suicide prevention.",
