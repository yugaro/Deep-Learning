            "text": "Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) is an obligate intracellular microsporidian parasite and infects a wide range of mammalian\nhosts, such as rabbits, rodents, dogs and humans [10, 11, 15]. E. cuniculi is an opportunistic pathogen in human patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other\nimmunocompromised people [3, 8]. Infected animals are arguably the reservoirs of human\nencephalitozoonosis [3]. Encephalitozoonosis is commonly observed in rabbits, and therefore, clinical assessment and diagnosis\nis well established in this species [8]. Although infections due to E. cuniculi are not common in cats,\nE. cuniculi infections have been reported to occur in cats abroad [2, 8, 14]. One author reported that the potential role of cats in the transmission of the infectious agent cannot be\nexcluded [14]. In Japan, a seroepidemiological survey of E. cuniculi infection in domesticated dogs and\ndomesticated rabbits has been performed [7, 16], but the prevalence of E.\ncuniculi infections in cats has not been reported. E. cuniculi in subclinically infected cats may represent a reservoir and potential\nrisk for immunocompromised patients [11, 12]. The purpose of this study was to\ndetermine the seroprevalence of E. cuniculi in cats in Japan to serve as baseline epidemiologic data and a potential source of microsporidial\ninfection in Japan. In addition, we compared the seropositive rate of domesticated cats with feral cats.",

In animals, the main target\norgans are the central nervous system and the kidney, which can result in a granulomatous encephalitis and nephritis [12].\nThe life cycle of E. cuniculi is simple and direct and, like other microsporidia, involves a proliferative merogonic stage, followed by a\nsporogonic stage resulting in rupture of the host cell and release of small (1.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00b5m), environmentally resistant, infective spores [12]. Spores can survive for many months in humid environments [9]. However, the natural\nmechanisms of E. cuniculi transmission are not fully understood. It is believed that the disease is spread horizontally in breeding with larger\nnumbers of animals by the fecal-oral route, but above all, along the oro-urinal pathway [4]. Vertical, transplacental\ntransmission of the infection may also play a key role in the epidemiology and pathogenesis, especially in carnivores and rodents [6, 13]. However, little is known about the occurrence of E. cuniculi in wildlife [12].",

A\nseroprevalence of 24% (17/72) of cats has been reported in Eastern Slovakia [4], and a recent study in Virginia, U.S.A., found\na seroprevalence of 6.5% (15/232) [5]. These differences may reflect the different habitats where samples were obtained and\nthe level of exposure to other sources of infection [12]. Furthermore, it has been reported that there are no sex differences\nin the prevalence of E. cuniculi [1], and the results of our study agree.",

In a previous study, seroprevalence investigations in Japan revealed E. cuniculi infection in feral rodents [18]. In addition, we found 8.3% of feral cats in Japan that had E. cuniculi antibodies. In the cats of Japan,\nthe mouse can be regarded as one of the important source of E. cuniculi infection.",
