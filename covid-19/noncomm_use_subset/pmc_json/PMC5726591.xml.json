As epidemic threats increase so is the potential impact of mathematical and statistical inference and simulation approaches to guide prevention and mitigation plans. As the recent 2013\u20132016 Ebola epidemic exemplified, an infectious disease outbreak often forces public health officials to make key decisions to mitigate the outbreak in a changing environment where multiple factors positively or negatively impact local disease transmission (Chowell et al., 2017). Hence, public health officials are often interested in practical yet mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches that comprehensively assimilate data and model uncertainty to 1) generate estimates of key transmission parameters, 2) assess the impact of control interventions (vaccination campaigns, behavior changes), 3) test hypotheses, 4) evaluate how behavior changes affect transmission dynamics, 5) gain insight to the contribution of different transmission pathways, 6) optimize the impact of control strategies, and 7) generate short and long-term forecasts, just to name a few.",

Models vary in their complexity in terms of the number of variables and parameters that characterize the dynamic states of the system, in their spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., discrete vs. continuous time), and in their design (e.g., deterministic or stochastic). While agent-based models, formulated in terms of characteristics and interactions among individual agents, have become increasingly used to model detailed processes often occurring at multiple scales (e.g., within host vs. population level), models based on systems of ordinary differential equations are widely used in the biological and social sciences. These dynamic models are specified by a set of equations and their parameters that together quantify the spatial-temporal states of the system via a set of interrelated dynamic quantities (e.g, viral load, susceptibility levels, disease prevalence) (Banks et al., 2009).",

In particular, previous analyses highlighted the presence of early sub-exponential growth patterns in infectious disease data across a diversity of disease outbreaks (Viboud et al., 2016). The generalized-growth model allows relaxing the assumption of exponential growth via a \u201cscaling of growth\u201d parameter, p. The model is given by the following differential equation:(1)C\u2032(t)=rCp(t)where C\u2032(t) describes the incidence growth phase over time t, the solution C(t) describes the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is a positive parameter denoting the growth rate, and p, the \u201cdeceleration of growth\u201d parameter varied between 0 and 1. If p=0, this equation describes constant incidence over time and the cumulative number of cases grows linearly while p=1 leads to the well-known exponential growth model (EXPM). Intermediate values of p between 0 and 1 describe sub-exponential (e.g. polynomial) growth patterns. In semi-logarithmic scale, exponential growth patterns are visually evident when a straight line fits well several consecutive generations in the growth pattern, whereas a downward curvature in semi-logarithmic scale indicates early sub-exponential growth dynamics.",

When C\u2032(t) represents the number of new infected cases at time t, the Richards model is given by the following differential equation:C'=rC[1\u2212(CK)a]where r represents the intrinsic growth rate in the absence of any limitation to disease spread, K is the size of the epidemic, and a is a parameter that measures the extent of deviation from the S-shaped dynamics of the classical logistic growth model (Turner et al., 1976). During the early stages of disease propagation when C(t) is significantly smaller than K, this model assumes an initial exponential growth phase. To account for initial sub-exponential growth dynamics (Viboud et al., 2016), we can modify the Richards model replacing the growth term rC by rCp (Viboud et al., 2016), incorporating a \u2018deceleration of growth\u2019 parameter (p). Hence, the GRM has the form:(2)C'=rCp[1\u2212(CK)a]where 0\u2264p\u22641. At the early stages of the epidemic, this model enables us to capture different growth profiles ranging from constant incidence (p=0), polynomial growth (0<p<1), to exponential growth (p=1) (Viboud et al., 2016). This model has been useful to generate post-peak forecasts of Zika and Ebola epidemics (Chowell et al., 2016b, Pell et al, 2016).",

In this method, multiple observations are repeatedly sampled from the best-fit model in order to quantify parameter uncertainty by assuming that the time series follow a Poisson distribution centered on the mean at the time points ti. However, it is also possible to consider overdispersion in the data (see next section). This computational method requires generating simulated data from f(ti,\u0398\u02c6), which is the best fit of the model to the data. The step-by-step algorithm to quantify parameter uncertainty follows (Fig. 5):1.Derive the parameter estimates \u0398\u02c6=(\u03b8\u02c61,\u03b8\u02c62,\u2026,\u03b8\u02c6m) through least-square fitting the model f(ti,\u0398) to the time series data yti=yt1,yt1,\u2026,ytnto obtain the best-fit model, f(ti,\u0398\u02c6).2.Using the best-fit model f(ti,\u0398\u02c6), we then generate S-times replicated simulated datasets, which we denote by f1\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6),f2\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6),\u2026,fS\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6).3.To generate the simulated datasets, we first use the best-fit model f(ti,\u0398\u02c6) to calculate the corresponding cumulative curve function, F\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6), as follows (see Fig. 6):F(tj,\u0398\u02c6)=\u2211l=1jf(tl,\u0398\u02c6)wherej=1,2,\u2026,n4.Each simulated dataset fk\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6) is generated by assuming a Poisson error structure as follows (Fig. 6):fk\u2217(tj,\u0398\u02c6)=Po(F(tj,\u0398\u02c6)\u2212F(tj\u22121,\u0398\u02c6))wherej=2,3,\u2026,nandk=1,2,\u2026,S",

As a general rule, a parameter is identifiable when its confidence interval lies in a finite range of values (Cobelli and Romanin-Jacur, 1976, Jacquez, 1996, Raue et al, 2009). Conversely, lack of parameter identifiability can be recognized when large perturbations in the model parameters generate small changes in the model output (Capaldi et al, 2012, Chowell et al., 2006b, Pillonetto et al., 2003). Multiple factors can give rise to lack of parameter identifiability. For instance, structural parameter non-identifiability (Cobelli & Romanin-Jacur, 1976) results from the particular structure of the model independently of the characteristics of the observed time series data used to estimate parameters. However, even when structural identifiability is not an issue, a parameter may still be non-identifiable in practice due to other factors including: 1) the amount and quality of the data available and/or 2) the number of parameters that are jointly estimated from the available data. This type of parameter non-identifiability is commonly referred to as practical non-identifiability (Raue et al., 2009).",

On the other hand, practical parameter non-identifiability issues could be fixed by 1) employing an alternative model of lower complexity when possible, 2) collecting more data about other states in the system to better characterize the system dynamical features, 3) increasing the spatial-temporal resolution of the data to better constrain the model parameters and/or 4) reducing the number of parameters that are jointly estimated, perhaps by constraining a subset of the unknown parameters based on estimates previously reported in similar studies and conducting extensive sensitivity analyses on those parameters (Arriola et al., 2009). Finally, specific approaches have been adapted to address parameter identifiability including regularization techniques that aim for stable parameter reconstruction (Smirnova & Chowell, 2017).",

Next, we use the simulated data to attempt to estimate parameters randp using the GGM from an increasing length of the early growth phase of the daily incidence curve simulated using the GRM. Fig. 10 shows the resulting empirical distributions of the parameters using an increasing length of the growth phase: 10, 20, \u2026, 80 days. Importantly, Fig. 10 shows that using only 10 days of data, it is not possible to reliably estimate the deceleration of growth parameter, p, because its confidence interval ranges widely from 0.5 to 1.0. Indeed, we conclude that it is not possible to discriminate between sub-exponential and exponential-growth dynamics based on data of only the first 10 days. In fact, the corresponding confidence interval of p include the values of 0.5 and 1.0, which indicate that both linear and exponential growth dynamics cannot be ruled out with the data at hand. As more data of the early growth phase is employed to estimate parameters of the GGM, the uncertainty in parameter estimates is not only reduced, but the parameter estimates are better constrained around their true values (Fig. 10).",

However, it is possible to use the empirical distributions of the parameters to assess the uncertainty associated with composite parameters whose values depend on several existing model parameters and are often useful to gauge the behavior of the modeled system. For instance, a key epidemiological parameter to measure the transmissibility of a pathogen is the basic reproduction number, R0 (Anderson and May, 1991, Diekmann et al., 1990, van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002). This parameter is a function of several parameters of the epidemic model including transmission rates and infectious periods of the epidemiological classes that contribute to new infections. This is an important parameter as it often serves as a threshold parameter for SEIR-type compartmental models. If R0>1 then an epidemic is expected to occur whereas values of R0<1cannot sustain disease transmission. For instance, for the simple SEIR model, the basic reproduction number is given by:R0=\u03b2\u03b3",

We can characterize the effective reproduction number and its uncertainty during the early epidemic exponential growth phase (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 2007). When the early dynamics follow sub-exponential growth, another method relies on the generalized-growth model (GGM) to characterize the profile of growth from early incidence data (Chowell et al., 2016c). In particular, the GGM can reproduce a range of growth dynamics from constant incidence (p=0) to exponential growth (p=1) (Viboud et al., 2016). We can generate the uncertainty associated with the effective reproduction number during the study period directly from the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates (r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i) where i=1,2,\u2026,S.. That is, Rtj(r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i) provides a curve of the effective reproduction number for each value of the parameters r\u02c6i,p\u02c6iwhere i=1,2,\u2026,S. Then, we can compute the curves Rtj(r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i) based on the incidence at calendar time tj denoted by I(tj,r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i), and the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval denoted by \u03c1tj. The effective reproduction number Rtj(r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i)can be estimated using the renewal equation (Chowell et al., 2016c, Nishiura et al., 2009):Rtj(r\u02c6i,p\u02c6i)=Itj\u2211k=0jItj\u2212k\u03c1tkwhere the denominator represents the total number of cases that contribute (as primary cases) to generating the number of new cases Itj (as secondary cases) at calendar time tj (Nishiura et al., 2009).",

In the process we have employed simple phenomenological and mechanistic models to characterize epidemic patterns as well as estimate key transmission parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0 and the effective reproduction number Rt. This uncertainty quantification approach is computationally intensive and relies solely on case incidence series from an unfolding outbreak and allows considerations of different error structures in the case series data (e.g., Poisson vs. negative binomial).",

Instead of relying on a single model, the information provided by multiple contending models can be integrated into ensemble models (e.g., model weighting schemes (Burnham & Anderson, 2002)), analogous to weather prediction systems (Raftery et al., 2005).",
