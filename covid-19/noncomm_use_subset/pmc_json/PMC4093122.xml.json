            "text": "Fatty acids are usually unbranched and contain an even number of carbon atoms, usually from 12 to 20. Fats containing one double bond are monounstaturated and those with more than one double bond are polyunsaturated. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential components required for normal cellular function and play a particularly important role in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields (Lopez-Huertas, 2010). Thereamong, Arachidonic acid (AA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) play a key role in growth and development of an organism and are usually referred to as highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) (Norsker and St\u00f8ttrup, 1994). A rational balanced level of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids is important, and it was found that the ideal n-6/n-3 ratio is 1:1 (Enser et al., 1996; Enser et al., 1998). Several n-3 fatty acid desaturase genes were studied in different species, like plants and algae (Meesapyodsuk et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2004; Sakuradani et al., 2005). These studies revealed that transgenic n-3 fatty acid desaturase genes were efficient in optimizing both kinds and proportions of PUFAs in tissues. The fat1 gene from Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) codes the FAT-1 protein, a 402 amino acid n-3 fatty acid desaturase which can transform C18 and C20 n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs. Supplementing n-3 PUFAs intake may be of benefit in human health. Currently, the study of fat1 gene is becoming an important topic in transgene research, and there have been many important breakthroughs. For instance, Lai et al. (2006) produced the first fat1 transgenic pig (Lai et al., 2006), which produced high levels of n-3 fatty acids from n-6 analogs, and their tissues have a significantly reduced ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids, but the production of the 22C n-3 PUFAs (docosapentaenoic acid, DPA and DHA) which has a higher nutritive value was still at a low level (Pan et al., 2009). A more thorough investigation of n-3 PUFAs and the effects of global climate change indicated that there would be a potential shortage of n-3 PUFAs in human diets (Kang, 2011). It is becoming clear that fat1 transgenic cattle with higher levels of n-3 PUFAs are becoming more urgent than ever. Unfortunately, many of the attempts to express fat1 in a transgenic background do not work well because of the difficulty of gene priming and expression in a different species.",

We also inserted the restriction enzyme digestion sites AatII, XhoI, SmaI and XbaI to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the sequence. Coding sequences and the whole genome of bovine muscle proteins were analyzed by CHIPS of EMBOSS (the European molecular biology open software suite) (Wright, 1990; Marra et al., 2003) and codon usage of SMS (http://www.bio-soft.net/sms/index.html) (Stothard, 2000). The effective number of codons (Frank Wright Nc value) could help to judge the number of codon types. High level gene expression has a low Nc value, by contrast, a high Nc value means a low level of expression efficiency. Codon optimization of fat1 was synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Company (Shanghai, China).",

Our vector, which we named pEF-GFP-fat1, contains a codon optimization fat1 cDNA driven by the EF1\u03b1 promoter (elongation factor 1-alpha promoter). An enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was used for transient expression in cells regulated by IRES sequence, a neo-kan and amp expression cassette served as a selection marker (Figure 1). The eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP was double digested with XhoI and MlsI (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) in a 10 \u03bcl reaction system: XhoI 0.75 \u03bcl, MlsI 0.75 \u03bcl, Tango buffer 2 \u03bcl, pEF-GFP plasmid 2 \u03bcl, Nuclease-free water 4.5 \u03bcl, and incubated at 37\u00b0C 5 h.

However, most of the long-chain n-3 PUFAs are found in deep-sea fishes. These resources are limited because of overfishing and marine environment pollution damage. Lai produced the first transgenic pig rich in n-3 fatty acids in 2006, which showed a 15 fold and 4 fold increase, but the concentration of EPA, DHA and DPA was still at a low level (Lai et al., 2006). Zhu cloned another fat1 gene from Caenorhabditis briggsae, and called it sFat1. The results showed that sFat1 produced a marked effect in transforming n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs, including more long-chain PUFAs like EPA, DHA and DPA (Zhu et al., 2008). However, the vector was driven by two Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters, which have a high expression efficiency and cytotoxicity. Consequently, the biosafety was an issue. It was also found that both the EF-1\u03b1-driven and CMV-driven vectors showed relatively constant expression levels in CHO cells in terms of GFP expression (Bauer et al., 2010). In order to increase the efficiency and transgenic animal safety, our study used EF-1\u03b1 as the promoter, which displayed a good efficiency in the pEF-GFP-fat1 vector and produced considerable long-chain n-3 PUFAs.",

Our results also demonstrate that codon optimization based on the usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein showed high catalysis efficiency. In the pathway of lipometabolism, n-6 PUFAs were catalyzed to n-3 PUFAs with high efficiency. This would be a useful trait to supply the lack of n-3 PUFAs ingestion from food. This study has proved that different methods of codon manipulation can play a role in the specificity of expressed proteins.",

It can transform n-6 PUFAs into n-3 in cells while n-3 and n-6 PUFAs cannot mutually transform in untransgenic cells. The FAT-1 desaturase can manipulate enzyme substrate n-6 PUFAs, while the enzyme catalysis rate partly depends on different inserted gene integration site. Polyclone was mixed in order to eliminate the effects of the inserted gene integration site. But because of the nondeterminacy of non-gene targeting, the results cannot remain stable.",

Although a large number of reports have been published, there are some problems in practical application. The research of the transgenic fat1 catalysis efficiency in vitro can lay the first stone in terms of high expression n-3 PUFAs in transgenic cattle. The results of this study have provided a good prospect for the use of transgenic technology to produce the special fish oil n-3 PUFAs for use as foodstuff. In order to raise the positive value and screen the best donor, we would like to further improve the condition of transfection and further reseach the codon sequence for the optimization of the fat1 gene.",
