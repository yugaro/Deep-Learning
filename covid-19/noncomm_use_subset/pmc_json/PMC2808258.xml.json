Moreover, although many of the proteins\n                            identified could conceivably play a role in adenovirus infection, we\n                            wanted to independently verify any potential changes in the nucleolar\n                            proteome. This would have a further key benefit of prioritizing future\n                            work relating these changes to function. We therefore used a range of\n                            antisera and tagged expression constructs to examine the fate of a\n                            number of proteins identified as being enriched or depleted in the\n                            nucleolus. We concentrated on those proteins for which reagents and\n                            published data on subcellular location were already available so we\n                            could be confident of their locations in uninfected cells. We compared\n                            the location of target antigens relative to adenovirus DBP, a key\n                            component of the adenovirus DNA replication machinery that is expressed\n                            to high levels in the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolus in\n                            virus-infected cells. DBP has a distinct pattern of fluorescence and\n                            well defined localization relative to viral mRNA transcription and\n                                de novo viral DNA synthesis (50). Fig. 3\n                            shows the effects of infection on those proteins apparently depleted\n                            from the nucleolus during viral infection. Two nucleolar antigens, hPOP1\n                            and Nopp140, were clearly depleted from the nucleolus (Fig. 3, A and\n                                B). hPOP1 was sequestered from the nucleolus into a\n                            mottled pattern within the nucleoplasm and was excluded from the\n                            DBP-rich centers (Fig.\n                            3A). Nopp140 protein showed some co-localization\n                            with viral DBP but also significant enrichment in centers adjacent to\n                            DBP, reminiscent of our previously published findings that UBF is\n                            sequestered into regions adjacent to DBP (11). We therefore compared UBF with Nopp140 to\n                            confirm that some Nopp140 is apparently sequestered in a manner similar\n                            to that of UBF (Fig.\n                            3B, bottom row). The next group\n                            of proteins, hnRNPU isoform a, SFPQ, U2AF65, hnRNPA2/B1,\n                            histone H1c, and exportin 5 were not detectable in the nucleolus by\n                            immunofluorescence (Fig. 1,\n                                C, D, E, and\n                                F, top rows). However, they were\n                            consistently detected in the nucleolus using proteomics methods and are\n                            considered components of the nucleolar proteome (51). In adenovirus-infected cells, they all showed\n                            a pattern of exclusion from the DBP-rich replication centers apart from\n                            hnRNPA2/B1, which did not show any striking change in its distribution.\n                            However, we noted that hnRNPU, SFPQ, and U2AF65 were localized adjacent\n                            to DBP-rich centers, whereas histone H1c was clearly distinct and\n                            separated from the DBP-rich centers (Fig.\n                                3G). Exportin 5 was also readily detectable\n                            in the cytoplasm of infected cells but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 3H).",
