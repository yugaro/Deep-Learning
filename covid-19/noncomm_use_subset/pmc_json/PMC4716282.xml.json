Unlike other known coronaviruses, both MERS- and SARS-CoV cause inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and spread down to the lower respiratory tract in most cases, resulting in deadly lung damage and death. The average incubation period, i.e. the period from exposure to symptom onset, is 5-7 days (range: 2-14 days) [3]. The main initial symptom is a fever, followed by symptoms of acute respiratory infection about 5 days later. If the lungs are affected, mechanical ventilation becomes necessary due to acute respiratory failure, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a hemodialysis procedure may be required, depending on the severity of the infection. Chronically ill patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of infection. Because of its high mortality rate, compliance with hospital infection prevention and control guidelines is more important than during any other infectious disease outbreaks.",

The room of a patient receiving mechanical ventilation may have a high degree of viral contamination, and HCWs entering it are at a very high risk of exposure. In such cases, use of a PAPR is recommended because the tight fit of a highly efficient mask cannot be ensured due to perspiration while performing medical procedures, and prolonged use can cause breathing discomfort.
