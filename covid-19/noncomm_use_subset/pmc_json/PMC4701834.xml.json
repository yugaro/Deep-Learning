Among negative-strand RNA viruses, the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the threat of new influenza virus pandemics further highlight the importance of developing effective vaccines and therapeutics that target any of these highly adaptable, genetically labile RNA viruses (1). Dengue virus, originally confined to tropical and subtropical areas, has begun to spread outside its former geographic limitations due to the changing ecology of mosquito populations in the face of urbanization and global warming. Previously dengue-free countries are now at risk: Japan, with no reported cases of dengue fever in 70 years, suffered a disease outbreak in 2014 (2). Due to the expanded range of each of the four dengue virus serotypes, it is now more likely for individuals who have been infected previously with one serotype to become infected with another. Antibodies from the first infection that do not neutralize the newly infecting serotype can enhance its symptoms, increasing the probability of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe and often fatal form of the disease (3). Given the demographics of infection by dengue virus and other emerging pathogens, it is highly desirable to reduce the complexity and expense of vaccines and treatments.",

All RNA viruses display error-prone replication strategies (7). With error rates of 10\u22124 to 10\u22125 per nucleotide copied, which result in accumulative mutation frequencies of greater than 10\u22124 per round of intracellular quasispecies generation (8), a large amount of preexisting diversity is ensured. In an inoculum of 105 dengue viruses, genomes with mutations at each nucleotide position should be present. Understandably, most approaches to reducing the outgrowth of drug-resistant viral genomes aim to reduce the frequency of generation of those genomes. Viral escape from combination therapy, for example, should require multiple mutations to confer resistance to the drug combination. Similarly, if proteins or functions in the human host are targeted, there may be very few ways for the virus to escape its dependence on those human \u201chost factors,\u201d and therefore such viral genomes will be very infrequent (9).",

Usually, drug resistance is dominant, i.e., a newly generated drug-resistant viral genome will be amplified and selected in the presence of a drug, even though it is generated in the same cell as its drug-susceptible parents and siblings. However, in some cases, defective genomes, such as drug-susceptible genomes, are dominant. This often occurs when the defect is in a protein that forms high-order oligomers. Then, in a cell that contains both defective and functional genomes, the final assemblage will contain both defective and functional subunits. Often, such chimeric structures are nonfunctional (10). Applying this principle to viral infections, we have shown that, although mutant poliovirus genomes that are resistant to capsid inhibitor V-073 could be readily generated, they were not selected in cultured cells or in mice (11). We termed viral targets such as the poliovirus capsid, for which drug-susceptible genomes are dominant over their drug-resistant siblings, \u201cdominant drug targets.\u201d",

Both in tissue culture and in mice, the selection of MK-0608-resistant viruses was readily observed. However, viruses resistant to ST-148 were not selected in tissue culture in the presence of drug-susceptible virus, and resistant viruses did not emerge during treatment of infected mice with ST-148.

Dengue virus core protein was determined to be the compound\u2019s target in direct binding experiments and by the mapping of a drug-resistant mutation, S34L, to the coding sequences for core protein (12) (Fig. 1A and B). Even for dominant drug targets, drug-resistant viruses can be readily selected because the necessary mutations preexist in the inoculum. Then, when a stock is passaged in cultured cells at low multiplicities of infection (MOIs), these preexisting variants can infect cells and be selected in the absence of potentially dominant wild-type proteins. Our question is, what about the variants that newly arise?",

These mixed infections were designed to mimic the selection of newly arising drug-resistant variants during infection of an animal. The generation of new drug-resistant genomes by polymerase error occurs within cells that already contain parental and, in most cases, other progeny genomes. Thus, a drug-resistant genome, in its cell of origin, will be outnumbered by its drug-susceptible relatives. The amount of the C-S34L mutant virus was kept constant at an average of 1 FFU (focus-forming unit) per cell. A Poisson distribution would predict that 1/e cells would be uninfected and the rest infected with one or two C-S34L drug-resistant viruses. The number of wild-type viruses per cell ranged from 0 to an average of 3 FFU/cell, an MOI at which almost all cells will be infected by wild-type virus. After one cycle of infection, 24 h, supernatants were harvested and the yields of total and ST-148-resistant virus were determined. The addition of increasing amounts of drug-susceptible wild-type virus resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of total and resistant virus (Fig. 1D). Even when most cells were infected by only one drug-resistant and one drug-susceptible virus, the yield of drug-resistant virus was significantly reduced (Fig. 1D). Therefore, for the core protein inhibitor ST-148, drug susceptibility is genetically dominant.",

The cDNA of the wild-type virus had been engineered to contain a new restriction site so that the proportions of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant genomes could be determined molecularly (Fig. 1F and G). AflII restriction digestion of amplified cDNA products resulted in no change in total or drug-resistant RNA in single infections versus coinfections (Fig. 1E). Therefore, the dominant inhibition of the production of infectious virus was not caused by a failure to synthesize viral RNA or to package it into secreted particles. Instead, particles are generated that are noninfectious. This is consistent with the mechanism proposed for ST-148 inhibition, i.e., targeting core protein assembly and virion morphogenesis.",

To test whether the drug-susceptible and drug-resistant proteins could coassemble, their cellular localizations (Fig. 2A) in single infections and coinfections were monitored. Scatturo et al. (13) found previously that wild-type core protein was predominately associated with cytoplasmic membranes in the absence of ST-148 (Fig. 2B, top row). In the presence of ST-148, the wild-type core protein was also found in nuclear fractions, which might contribute to the compound\u2019s antiviral activity (13). In contrast, the C-S34L mutant protein, which localized almost exclusively with cytoplasmic membranes in the absence of drug, did not relocalize in the presence of drug (Fig. 2B, middle row). To determine whether the drug-susceptible protein could cause the relocalization of drug-resistant protein, or vice versa, we monitored total core protein in 1:1 infections (Fig. 2B, bottom row). The localization of core in the mixed infection in the presence of drug was not the sum of the individual infections (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 to 6). Instead, it was indistinguishable from that of the drug-susceptible virus alone (Fig. 2B, top row right). The different localization patterns of wild-type and C-S34L mutant core proteins (Fig. 2B, top and middle rows) are quantified in Fig. 2C. Figure 2D shows the expected amounts of core membrane association if the patterns are additive (Fig. 2D, left). The observed pattern (Fig. 2D, right) instead mimicked that of drug-susceptible virus alone (Fig. 2C, left). Therefore, the wild-type, drug-susceptible phenotype is dominant over the drug-resistant phenotype in the presence of ST-148. That the drug-resistant protein fractionates differently when in the presence of the drug-susceptible protein supports the hypothesis that the two kinds of proteins coassemble.",

            "text": "Nucleoside analog 2\u2032-C-methyl-7-deaza-adenosine (also termed MK-0608, or 7-DMA) (Fig. 3A) was originally developed as an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus polymerase (14) but also displays antiviral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 in cultured cells and in mice (15). Inhibition of dengue virus serotype 2 in BHK-21 cells is shown in Fig. 3. To select viruses resistant to MK-0608, dengue virus pools grown in C6/36 mosquito cells were serially passaged in BHK-21 cells in the presence or absence of increasing MK-0608 concentrations. For each passage, the multiplicity of infection was below 0.1 FFU per cell, which allowed any drug-resistant variants to propagate in the absence of coinfecting drug-susceptible virus. The amount of viral amplification at each passage is displayed as the ratio of total output virus to the initial inoculum (Fig. 3B). Sequence analysis of passaged viruses revealed mutations in all populations, some of which were identical in the drug-treated and untreated populations (Table 1). Such mutations likely conferred a growth advantage in BHK-21 cells; one of these, Q399H, has proven useful in adaptation to other mammalian cell lines (R. M. Deans et al., unpublished data). Notably, only the two viral pools passaged in the presence of MK-0608 acquired mutations in the NS5 coding region: A60T in pool 1 and Y201H in pool 2 (Table 1). When tested individually, the NS5-A60T and NS5-Y201H mutations each conferred significant resistance to MK-0608 compared to wild-type virus (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, both mutations mapped to the methyltransferase domain of the NS5 protein (Fig. 3D). Thus, it is likely either that MK-0608 inhibits methyltransferase activity or that allosteric interactions between the methyltransferase and the polymerase domains (16) relieve MK-0608\u2019s inhibition at the polymerase active site.",

The growth of a fixed amount (1 FFU/cell) of drug-resistant virus was monitored either alone or in the presence of various amounts of wild-type, drug-susceptible virus (Fig. 4A). Infections were continued for a single cycle of infection in the presence of 50 \u00b5M MK-0608. Supernatant titers were then determined in the absence of MK-0608, to measure the amount of total virus, and in the presence of 50 \u00b5M MK-0608, to measure the amount of resistant virus. When infected in isolation, drug-resistant viruses replicated in the presence of the drug (Fig. 4B and C, left). Upon coinfection with drug-susceptible virus, the titers of drug-resistant virus did not decrease, as had those of the ST-148-resistant virus (Fig. 1D). Instead, the yields of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible viruses increased with increasing MOIs. Thus, the drug-resistant virus rescued the drug-susceptible virus, and drug resistance was dominant. The dominance of drug-resistant virus was observed even when the MOI of drug-susceptible virus was 10-fold higher and when the MOIs of both viruses were increased.",

To quantify the frequency of drug-resistant viruses in the multiple rounds of amplification that occur during murine infection, we needed a mouse model that gave rise to high viral yields. A frequently used mouse model for dengue virus infection is intravenous inoculation into strain 129 IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 (alpha and gamma interferon [IFN]-deficient) mice (15, 17, 18).

C57BL/6 IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 mice were also susceptible to dengue virus infection, and the yield of virus obtained from their spleens following the same inoculum was on average 10-fold higher (Fig. 5E). As this higher yield facilitated the detection of subpopulations such as drug-resistant viruses, we employed C57BL/6 IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 mice to measure drug-resistant viruses during treatment of dengue virus-infected mice with ST-148 or MK-0608.",

After 4 days, MK-0608 treatments significantly decreased total viral yield (Fig. 5B). To determine whether this inhibitory pressure led to the selection of drug-resistant viruses, drug-resistant virus and RNA were quantified as for the ST-148 infection. Virus from control mice showed no increase in drug resistance when passaged in the presence of the drug. However, virus from MK-0608-treated mice showed significantly more amplification of drug-resistant viruses (Fig. 5C) and RNA (Fig. 5D). The amount of drug resistance observed correlated somewhat with the amount of selection pressure exerted (Fig. 5B to D, open symbols). However, this alone does not explain the large increase in resistance observed in MK-0608-treated mice. This highly significant selection for MK-0608 resistance contrasts with the lack of selection observed when the oligomeric core protein was targeted.",

Wild-type and S34L core proteins in mixed infections exhibited similar fractionation patterns, even when the patterns changed in the presence of ST-148 (Fig. 2).

Assuming random assembly, this argues that as much as 50% of an oligomeric assemblage of core protein can be composed of drug-resistant subunits and remain phenotypically drug susceptible.

The intracellular replication cycle of dengue virus differs from poliovirus in several ways relevant to the efficacy of dominant drug targeting. Dengue virus is an enveloped virus that continuously buds from infected cells; therefore, the intracellular copy number of viral genomes and their products is likely to be lower than that of poliovirus. The RNA replication complexes of dengue virus are sequestered within endoplasmic reticulum invaginations, which might preclude access of the products of sibling genomes to each other. Nonetheless, the dominance of ST-148 susceptibility argues that core proteins encoded by different genomes interact directly. The creation of dominant inhibitors of drug-resistant viruses by their own families, while macabre, is a novel application of the \u201cquasispecies\u201d concept (7, 28). If implemented, the use of dominant drug targets should reduce the number of drugs necessary for efficacious inhibition of viral infection.",

The ratios of output over input virus for individual mice are shown as black circles for no drug treatment; colors show values for drug-resistant virus in the presence of selection. (D) Viral RNA was extracted from BHK-21 amplified supernatants and quantified by qRT-PCR. The ratios of output viral RNA molecules and input focus-forming units are shown. (E) Dengue virus yields in spleens of 129 IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 mice retro-orbitally infected with 107 FFU/mouse after 4 days postinfection. Each point represents the results for one mouse. Shown are the average results and standard deviations as determined by the Mann-Whitney test. Open symbols indicate MK-0608-treated mice with a total virus yield lower than any observed upon ST-148 treatment. All data shown are average results \u00b1 standard deviations from two or three biological replicates.",

Following intradermal dengue virus (DENV) inoculation, resident dendritic cells (DCs) become infected and migrate to the spleen through lymphatic vessels. A major viral replication burst occurs in DCs and macrophages (M\u00d8s) in the spleen, where suppression or selection of drug-resistant viruses depends on the choice of viral target: ST-148-resistant core proteins (red circles) coassemble with drug-susceptible core proteins (black circles), resulting in suppression of drug resistance by formation of noninfectious chimeric virions. The formation of replication complexes of MK-0608-resistant NS5 proteins (purple ovals) is not inhibited by the presence of drug-susceptible NS5 proteins (black ovals).",
