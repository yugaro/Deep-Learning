Following Dr. Larrick's introductory remarks regarding an investor's perspective on therapeutic antibody drugs, Max Vasquez (Adimab) will describe state-of-the-art bioinformatic and in silico methods to facilitate preclinical antibody development. Akbar Nayeem (Molecular Discovery Technologies) will expand on this topic describing computational methods to optimize the structure of clinical candidate antibodies. Next, Nicola Beaucamp (Roche Innovation Center Penzberg) will describe Roche's integrated approach to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line selection, upstream process, downstream process and analytics to deliver high-quality bispecific antibodies. Following a break, the workshop will conclude with 2 case studies. The first, by Dorina Saro (Johnson & Johnson), on the development of analytical and biophysical tools to select bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates will focus on product develop-ability, and the second, by Thi-Sau Migone (Igenica Biotherapeutics), will cover proteomic-based discovery of a novel hematologic cancer target and IND-enabling studies of a site-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). We anticipate an exciting and informative workshop.",

Christopher Thanos (Halozyme Therapeutics) and Sanjay Khare (ImmunGene, Inc.) will discuss advances in ADC targeting to improve therapeutic index. Dr. Thanos engineered an EGFR antibody for increased tumor specificity, leading to activity against KRAS/BRAF-mutated tumors in vivo. Dr. Khare demonstrates selective targeting of an interferon (IFN) payload with reduced systemic toxicity. After the break, Davide Corti (Humabs Biomed SA) will turn our attention to infectious disease, in which escape from antibody targeting remains a critical topic. Dr. Corti shows studies for a number of antibodies derived from human infection that employ various antiviral mechanisms to allow for extraordinary breadth in activity against a range of virus subtypes and subfamilies. Rudolf Kerschbaumer (Baxter Innovations GmbH) will discuss novel data on the well-known pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Using phage-display, Dr. Kerschbaumer isolated antibodies that target oxidized MIF (ox-MIF), a previously unrecognized disease-related variant of the cytokine with interesting activity against cancer-associated inflammation and in vivo tumor growth inhibition. Finally, Yuki Iwayanagi (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd) will complete the session by discussing a novel approach to enhance the clearance of soluble antigens by making use of engineered antibodies that combine pH-dependent binding activity with enhanced selectivity for the IgG Fc receptor Fc\u03b3RIIb.",

            "text": "The potential merits of cytokine therapy, such as interleukin (IL)-2 administration in treating cancer, have long been recognized but it was blocked from routine use by adverse side effects that were generally not tolerated by patients at the dosages necessary for therapeutic effects. This barrier was eliminated with the observation in 1992 by Stephen D. Gillies and co-workers that antibody-targeted IL-2 stimulates cytotoxic T-cell killing of tumor cells at doses far below the threshold for IL-2 toxicity. They genetically fused IL-2 to the C-termini of both H chains in the targeting antibody. Since antibody-cytokine fusion proteins are localized in tumors by virtue of association of the antibody with its tumor target, the IL-2 fusion partner can be concentrated exactly where it is needed, so it is locally effective at doses far below the systemic therapeutic window required for IL-2 alone. This discovery was made when antibody engineering had emerged with a new generation of methods and molecules that provided for antibody-targeted delivery of human therapeutic fusion proteins. Four pioneers who used diverse approaches, i.e., a variety of fusion proteins, alternative cytokines and distinct targets, will discuss their work, along with two more recent converts to the development of immunocytokine (IC) therapeutics. The session marks a pivotal juncture for these singular immunotherapeutics, and will include presentations on the latest advances in IC engineering to the most recent clinical results.",

The AABs directed against these epitopes induce their agonist-like effect by cross-linking and stabilization of the active receptor conformation. In contrast to the classical agonists, the functional AABs prevent the receptor desensitization normally seen if the receptors were stimulated for a longer time with the agonists. Because these AABs act like the corresponding receptor agonists and prevent the receptor desensitization, such AABs may play a role in the pathogenesis of several cardiometabolic diseases.",

He will describe a humanized monoclonal antibody (Hu5F9-G4), which was developed by his group to block the interaction between CD47 and its ligand SIRP-\u03b1 on phagocytic cells. Dr. Willingham will share the results of in vivo preclinical studies demonstrating the ability of Hu5F9-G4 to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.",

Dr. Saunders will share evidence of the ability of one of their anti-GARP antibodies, MHG-8, to inhibit immune suppression mediated by Tregs in a graft-versus-host disease model induced by transplantation of human PBMCs (+/- autologous Tregs) into immunocompromised NOD/Scid/IL2Rg-/- mice, suggesting a potential role of anti-GARP antibodies in the treatment of cancer or chronic infections.

Ernest Smith (Vaccinex, Inc.) will provide details of an antibody discovery platform that enables efficient mammalian cell-based expression of a library of human antibodies in full-length IgG format on the surface of vaccinia virus. Upon infection of mammalian cells, the antibody is incorporated into newly produced virus and displayed on the surface of the host cell. This approach combines the advantages of virus panning and cell sorting into one technology. To conclude the session, Diana Bowley (AbbVie Bioresearch Center) will give an overview of an informatics platform that supports the design, cloning, expression, and purification of large panels of bispecific dual-variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-IgTM) candidates. Dr. Bowley will describe how the platform is also used to assess properties of the molecules, including selectivity, cross reactivity, epitope binding, and stability.

This session will focus primarily on emerging data from antibodies that target immune checkpoints to treat cancer.

Moreover, combinations of immune modulating antibodies, such as ipilimumab plus anti-PD-1 demonstrate extremely promising activity in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. Important emerging clinical indications include non-small cell lung cancer, as presented by Hossein Borghaei (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Finally, ADCs are beginning to fulfill their clinical promise, as exemplified by the success of ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an anti-Her2: maytansinoid conjugate. As presented by Kyle Holen (AbbVie), another agent that is showing early promise, ABT-414, targets activated EGFR and delivers a cytotoxic payload.

Recent results suggest that activity in 2015 may be even greater than 2014, which was a banner year for transitions into pivotal studies, as well as for first marketing approvals. Relevant data for transitions to first Phase 3 studies that occurred in 2014 and those projected for 2015 will be summarized.

Productively rearranged VL and VH genes encode the variable domains of antibodies and B-cell receptors; similarly, those of V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 genes encode the variable domains of \u03b1/\u03b2 T-cell receptors. B- and T-cell mRNA encoding antibodies and TcRs, or plasmid DNA encoding phage libraries, constitute the material from which NGS immune repertoires are derived. V regions from tens of millions of cells or phage clones can be sequenced in bulk with high coverage (i.e., in the 100 s of millions) to arrive at DNA sequences reflecting a repertoire's sequence diversity and relative copy numbers. From such data, the progress of phage library screenings can be precisely followed; antibody and TcR repertoires can be assessed in depth (e.g., following residual disease after treatment for leukemia or lymphoma), and differences among B- and/or T-cell populations can be assessed between healthy vs. diseased states, and after vaccination. As well, somatic mutations among clonally related antibodies can be identified, and analyzed to reveal the \u201cphylogenetic history\u201d of B-cell clones.",
