            "text": "Many viruses use programmed ribosome frameshifting to increase the coding capacity of their genome and to regulate stoichiometric ratio between viral proteins (1\u20134). The two HIV-1 genes, gag and pol, encode viral structural proteins and enzymes, respectively, and overlap by 205 nt. Synthesis of the Gag-Pol polyprotein requires \u20131 ribosome frameshifting (\u20131FS) (5). The ratio between Gag and Gag-Pol is crucial for virus propagation and its dysregulation is detrimental for replication, virion formation and infectivity of HIV-1 (6\u20139). The efficiency of gag-pol \u20131FS in human cells is about 10%, ranging from 2% to 11% with different reporters (10\u201313). This \u20131FS efficiency has been recapitulated in vivo or in vitro in mammalian, yeast or Escherichia coli translation extracts (5,11,14\u201322), suggesting that the virus exploits evolutionary conserved features of the translational apparatus.",

            "text": "\u20131FS is governed by two cis-acting elements in the mRNA, the slippery site (SS1) U1 UUU4 UUA7 that encodes Phe (UUU) and Leu (UUA) in the 0-frame (5), and a stem-loop (SL) structure downstream of the slippery site (SL1; Figure 1A). SS1 gives rise to two frameshifting products, one that contains the 0-frame peptide Phe-Leu followed by the \u20131-frame sequence (FLR product; Figure 1A and B), and another with a second Phe incorporated instead of Leu (FFR product). In mammalian cells \u223c30% of frameshifting ribosomes do not insert Leu, but are likely to insert Phe at the same position (5). Also in E. coli, both products are produced, with the FLR constituting about 80% of the product (5,15,23,24). Further HIV frameshifting product heterogeneity may result from \u20132 frameshifting (25). In addition, the gag-pol gene has a second, putative slippery site (pSS2) 38 nt downstream of the canonical SS1 (26\u201330). This slippery site is also conserved albeit to a lesser degree than the first slippery site (31). The sequence of pSS2 (U1 UUU4 CUU7) is not particularly slippery, but a substitution of C5 with U (C5U), which appears as a compensatory resistance mutation during anti-HIV therapy, may facilitate additional FS at this otherwise silent site (26\u201328,30).",

            "text": "The mechanism of frameshifting on the gag-pol mRNA and the factors that define the ratio between the two \u20131FS products are unclear. The variety of proposed mechanisms of \u20131FS (23), the uncertain significance of the second slippery site, and the lack of mechanistic information about alternative slippages (e.g., \u20132FS or +1FS) have prompted us to study gag-pol frameshifting in real time in a fully reconstituted in vitro translation system. We show that FS pathway and efficiency are determined by the availability of Leu-tRNALeu reading the UUA codon. The potential alternative +1 and \u20132 slippages can also operate when other aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are in limited supply. We show that the UUA-specific tRNALeu is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. Furthermore, we have characterized the role of the second slippery site in supporting \u20131FS. Multiple ways to modulate the frameshifting efficiency could help the virus to maintain the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio, which is crucial for its viability.",

Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using Q5 DNA-polymerase (NEB) (42) (Supplementary Tables S2\u2013S4). mRNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA-polymerase (43,44) and purified using the RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Control mRNAs used to determine the rate of Arg-tRNAArg incorporation in 0-frame (Supplementary Figure S3B) were made by chemical synthesis (IBA, G\u00f6ttingen) and contained an E. coli Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence inserted 9 nt upstream of the start codon AUG. For translation in bacterial translation system, a SD sequence was inserted into the HIV mRNA 6 nt upstream of the start codon AUG. In the short mRNAs used in the codon walk experiments, AUG was introduced 8 nt upstream of the SS1 and the length of the sequence following the SS1 was 56 nt encompassing SL1 and pSS2. In the mRNAs used to study +1 and \u20132 frameshifting, the GGG codon (Gly) following the slippery site was mutated to UGG (Trp) to distinguish between the \u20131-, \u20132- and +1-frameshifting products (10). The nearest natural AUG in gag mRNA was used as a start codon in the long mRNAs to study gag-pol translation products by PAGE. The stop codon UAG was introduced in the 0-frame 156 nt downstream of the AUG and 120 nt after the SS1 to allow the separation between the 0-frame (52 aa) and \u20131-frame (120 aa) products. 0-, \u20131- and \u20132-frame control mRNAs contain respective sequence cloned in-frame with SS1 and pSS2 being mutated to prevent slippages; these mRNAs contained 324 nt after the SS1 harboring SL1, pSS2 and pSL2. HIV mRNAs for eukaryotic translation contained the native 5\u2019 UTR from rabbit \u03b2-globin mRNA and a Kozak sequence with an embedded AUGG site to allow for efficient initiation.

Translation products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on an RP-8 column (LiChroSpher100, Merck) applying an adapted gradient of acetonitrile (0\u201365%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted fractions were mixed with Ultima Gold XR scintillation liquid (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed by scintillation counting.

The primer for the reverse transcription entailed a tRNA-specific sequence and a stem-loop sequence (53). The tRNA-specific primer was the same for tRNAUAALeu and tRNACAGLeu (complementary to positions 47\u201355) and different for tRNACACVal and tRNAUACVal (complementary to positions 62\u201370) (Supplementary Table S5). cDNA synthesis was performed as described in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (for gene-specific primers) using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 5 \u03bcl of DNase I-digested RNA (0.25 \u03bcg).

The primers used for qPCR were taken from (53); the forward primer for the qPCR is highly specific to each tRNA and the reverse primer is universal (Supplementary Table S5). For each run, technical triplicates were analyzed for each sample and reactions containing water instead of template cDNA were used as negative control. Cycle conditions were chosen as follows: one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles consisting of 15 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. Finally, a linear temperature increase from 60 to 90\u00b0C with a ramp of 1\u00b0C per step and each step lasting 5 s was performed to obtain a melting curve for each reaction. In order to compare tRNAUAALeu/tRNACAGLeu and RNAUACVal/ tRNACACVal tRNA ratio between cell lines, cycle threshold (ct) values for each tRNA were normalized against the respective ct values for 18S rRNA.",

For the mechanistic work, we used the fully reconstituted translation system from E. coli, because the overall efficiency and the ratio of the FLR and FFR products is similar in mammalian cells and in E. coli (5,15,23,24), the functional centers of the ribosomes where frameshifting takes place are highly conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (54), and it is not feasible to prepare materials for the reconstituted eukaryotic translation system in amounts needed for this type of analysis. We first tested the potential routes for frameshifting. The model HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA encompasses the natural frameshifting site with the translation start codon AUG three codons upstream of the slippery site (Figure 1B). We formed a 70S initiation complex with the mRNA and fMet-tRNAfMet and started translation by the addition of ternary complexes of elongation factor (EF)-Tu\u2013GTP with the desired combination of purified aa-tRNAs and EF-G\u2013GTP. Consecutive amino acid incorporation results in a 0-frame peptide fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Leu-Gly (MQANFLG) and the \u20131-frame peptides fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg (MQANFLR) or fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Phe-Arg (MQANFFR). Peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) (Supplementary Figure S1). The overall frameshifting efficiency was determined as a yield of \u20131-frame Arg incorporation relative to the sum of \u20131- and 0-frame peptides. With the mRNA containing a native slippery sequence, a large fraction of peptides contains Arg (Figure 1B), indicating efficient \u20131FS. As expected, the U4C mutation, which changes the SS1 sequence to U UUC UUA (5), abolishes FS (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S3A).",

If slippage occurred during decoding, the \u20131FS efficiency must depend on the competition between the 0-frame and \u20131-frame aa-tRNAs, Leu-tRNA and Phe-tRNA, for binding at the UUUA sequence in SS1. In fact, the addition of Leu-tRNANAALeu (E. coli tRNA that reads the UUA and UUG codons; the anticodon is indicated as a subscript; N is a post-transcriptionally modified nucleotide) dramatically lowers the \u20131FS efficiency from about 50% in the absence to 12% in the presence of Leu-tRNANAALeu (Figure 1C). In contrast, a mixture of near-cognate Leu-tRNA isoacceptors that collectively read the CUN family of Leu codons has no effect. The high \u20131FS efficiency observed in the absence of Leu-tRNANAALeu indicates that ribosomes can slip into the \u20131-frame prior to, and independent of, Leu incorporation. By estimating the ratio of Leu, Phe and Arg incorporation into the \u20131-frame product, we can determine how the \u20131FS pathway changes with the Leu-tRNANAALeu concentration (Figure 1D). In the absence of Leu-tRNANAALeu, only the FFR product is formed. Upon addition of Leu-tRNANAALeu, the FLR product becomes prevalent. Thus, frameshifting at the gag-pol slippery site can switch between two regimes and their prevalence depends on the concentration of the critical tRNA.",

Again, if frameshifting took place during decoding, the 0-frame Gly-tRNAGly and \u20131-frame Arg-tRNAArg should compete for binding to the ribosome. This is, however, not observed, as the \u20131FS efficiency is independent of Gly-tRNAGly and Arg-tRNAArg concentrations (Figure 1E). This finding suggests that slippage and commitment to the new reading frame occur after Leu incorporation, but prior to decoding of the next codon by Gly- or Arg-tRNA. This is similar to the well-studied cases of \u20131FS on IBV 1a/1b and dnaX mRNAs, where slippage occurs at a late stage of translocation of the slippery-site tRNAs, and suggests a similar two-tRNA frameshifting mechanism (55\u201360).",

Because formation of the \u20131-frame FFR product depends on the slippage at the \u2018hungry\u2019 UUA codon, we further tested whether this allows also \u20132 and +1FS. We note that normally such slippage events would lead to premature termination due to stop codons appearing in the \u20132 or +1 frames downstream of the frameshifting site and that such peptides are difficult to detect in vivo, but alternative slippage events could change the ratio between the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. To distinguish between the products of the 0-, \u20131-, \u20132- and +1-FS, we changed the GGG (Gly) codon following the slippery site into UGG (Trp) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2), a mutation that does not affect the \u20131FS efficiency in vivo in human cells (10). In addition to the aa-tRNAs needed for translation of the MQANFL sequence, we added purified Trp-tRNATrp (W), elongator Met-tRNAMet (M) and Tyr-tRNATyr (Y). The expected 0-frame peptide is now MQANFLW and the \u20131-frame peptides are MQANFFM and MQANFLM. Shifting into the +1-frame should yield MQANFY and into the \u20132-frame MQANFFY and MQANFLY. When all required aa-tRNAs are present, the \u20131-frame peptides account for about 25% of product, consistent with the \u20131FS efficiency on the native gag-pol sequence in the presence of equimolar amounts of Leu-tRNANAALeu and ribosomes (Figure 2), whereas the amounts of the +1 and \u20132 peptides are small. When Met-tRNAMet is omitted, \u20132FS increases more than 2-fold, whereas the +1FS is not changed. \u20132FS is enhanced because \u20131FS exposes a \u2018hungry\u2019 Met codon in the A site, which favors the slippage. In the absence of Leu- and Trp-tRNA, \u20131FS efficiency increases to 45%, as expected; \u20132FS is unchanged; and again a small amount of the +1-frame product is formed. Without addition of Leu-, Trp- and Met-tRNA, the products of all three alternative frames are found. These data suggest that \u20132 and +1FS can occur when one or more of the aa-tRNAs are lacking; however, when all aa-tRNAs are available the \u20131FS pathway is prevalent.",

Because a fraction of initiation complexes does not enter translation, we introduced a step that accounts for this unproductive population (M \u2192 Mn, non-reactive). We also noticed that MQANF-tRNAPhe in the absence of the A-site ligand tends to slowly dissociate from the ribosome (Supplementary Figure S3D); to account for this loss of peptidyl-tRNA we introduced the respective drop-off reaction. Global fitting of the time courses using numerical integration yielded a unique solution for all rate constants (Figure 3A and B; Supplementary Table S1). The step leading to the incorporation of the second Phe is slow, \u223c0.01 s\u22121, compared to all translation steps, which are at least 10 times faster. MQANFF peptides do not accumulate and are converted to the \u20131-frame peptide, MQANFFR.

If Leu is incorporated, the 0-frame MQANFL product can partition between the 0-frame MQANFLG and the \u20131-frame MQANFLR. Global fitting of the time courses gives well-defined rate constants for most of the steps (Figure 3C\u2013E). The rate-limiting step for the \u20131-frame FFR pathway has a rate constant of \u223c0.03 s\u22121, similar to that for the isolated FFR pathway. The efficiency of the FFR pathway depends on the ratio of the rates of \u20131-slippage and Leu-tRNANAALeu binding. While the rate of slippage is constant, the rate of Leu-tRNANAALeu binding increases with concentration. This explains why the addition of excess Leu-tRNANAALeu inhibits the FFR route. At high concentrations of Leu-tRNANAALeu, the probability to bind Leu-tRNANAALeu to the A site is higher than to slip into the \u20131 -frame. At this condition, the FFR pathway is suppressed and only the FLR pathway remains operational. After Leu incorporation, the \u20131FS efficiency of the FLR route is defined at the translocation step, because the partitioning between 0- and \u20131-frames takes place before decoding by Gly- and Arg-tRNAs (Figure 1E). The ratio of the rate constants of Gly and Arg incorporation (0.53 and 0.04 s\u22121, respectively; Supplementary Table S1) gives the \u20131FS efficiency after Leu incorporation.",

Leu-tRNAUAALeu is 7\u201317-fold less abundant than Leu-tRNACAGLeu in cell lines derived from T lymphocytes, and about 20-fold in HeLa cells, whereas in other types of human cells the ratio is about 1:3 (Figure 4). The Leu-tRNAUAALeu concentration varies by as much as 10-fold, whereas for Leu-tRNACAGLeu the differences are smaller, except for HeLa cells, where the Leu-tRNACAGLeu concentration is increased (Supplementary Figure S4A). As a control, we quantified the relative abundance of Val-tRNAVal isoacceptors reading a rare GUA codon and an abundant GUG codon. The tRNAUACVal isoacceptor reading the rare codon is about 7\u20138 times less abundant than common tRNACACVal, except for the 293T epithelial cells, where the amount of tRNAUACVal is even lower (Figure 4). Because the relative abundance of tRNAUAALeu in HeLa cells is similar to that in cells used as a model for the HIV infection, we used total human tRNA purified from HeLa cells for the in vitro translation experiments described below.",

With native human aa-tRNA, \u03b3B-crystallin mRNA is translated efficiently (Supplementary Figure S4D). Introducing synonymous mutations in the mRNA to match the codon usage in E. coli (62) reduces the yield of full-length product (Supplementary Figure S4D).

To distinguish 0- and \u20131-frame translation products, we introduced a stop codon UAG in the 0-frame to obtain a peptide 52 amino acids (aa) in length; \u20131FS results in a 120-aa peptide product.

Formation of 0-frame and \u20131-frame products starts after a 30-s delay that may be caused by an early translational pausing event (appearing as a prominent peptide band between 7 and 30 s of translation (Figure 5B and C; Supplementary Figure S4E). In contrast, the \u20132-frame product appears after a much longer delay of 120 s. At this time, the synthesis of the 0-frame product is already completed on most ribosomes, suggesting that the \u20132FS may arise on a fraction of ribosomes that undergo long translation pausing. Addition of exogenous Leu-tRNANAALeu decreases the \u20131FS efficiency to 4% (Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure S4F). A similarly reduced FS efficiency is observed when the UUA codon is mutated to UUC, which does not interrupt the slippery run of six Us, but changes the identity of the tRNA reading the second slippery codon to the abundant tRNAPhe (Figure 5E). Thus, reassigning the second codon of the slippery site to an abundant tRNA has the same effect as adding excess of tRNANAALeu to the native sequence. Shortening the slippery site to four U residues decreased FS to 2%. Disrupting SS1 alone or together with pSS2 diminishes the FS efficiency to about 1%, which is the background level of these experiments (Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure S5B).",

Ribosomal subunits (40S and 60S), initiation factors (eIF1A, eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF5, and eIF5B) and Met-tRNAi were used to form the 80S initiation complex on an mRNA with an unstructured 5\u2019UTR coding for the SS1 and the SL1 fragment of HIV-1 (Figure 1A). To synthesize the 0-frame MVANFLG and the \u20131-frame MVANFLR peptides, we used the tRNA from HeLa cells aminoacylated with a mixture of the required amino acids with or without Leu; incorporation of the \u20131-frame Arg was monitored by the HPLC analysis (Supplementary Figure S4G). As controls, we included the mRNA coding for MVANFLR in 0-frame (\u20131-frame control), which provides the estimate for the maximum Arg incorporation, and the mRNA without the SS1 but with SL1 (0-frame control). The \u20131FS efficiency in this fully reconstituted eukaryotic translation system is about 20\u201325% in the presence of native amounts of tRNAUAALeu (Figure 5F and Supplementary Figure S4G). When leucine was omitted from the aminoacylation mixture, the \u20131FS efficiency increases to 40% (Figure 5F).

As long as the SS1 sequence is unchanged, mutations in pSS2 have little effect on overall \u20131FS, but change the \u20132FS efficiency, which, in turn, leads to slight variations in \u20131FS. The \u20132FS efficiency is higher when both SS1 and pSS2 are slippery, suggesting that \u20132FS results from dual \u20131-slippage on both sites rather than from \u20132-slippage on pSS2 alone. Replacing the rare CUU codon in pSS2 with the abundant CUG reduces \u20132FS indicating that the second slippage is due to \u2018hungry\u2019 FS on pSS2. When the U-string in SS1 is disrupted, the frameshifting efficiency is higher in the construct where pSS2 is slippery compared to the native sequence. The presumed secondary structure of the mRNA downstream of pSS2 (Supplementary Figure S5) has no effect. Disruption of both slippery sites decreases frameshifting to background levels. Thus, pSS2 supports a low-level FS event that can rescue HIV-1 when SS1 is mutated, but also causes \u20132FS, which in the native sequence leads to premature termination of translation.",

The switch between the two regimes is modulated by the availability of the UUA-specific tRNALeu, which we show to be rare in cell lines derived from human immune cells. This notion is supported by in vivo experiments indicating that limitation of Leu in the culture media leads to increased \u20131FS in E. coli (15). The exact \u20131FS efficiency on the gag-pol mRNA differs depending on the type of model system, a phenomenon that has been noted before and attributed to different translation rates in vivo and in vitro (18,19,63,64); presumably, the presence of the bulk aa-tRNA also plays a role (compare Figures 1C and 5C).

            "text": "As the ratio of the Gag and Gag-Pol products is crucial for virus propagation (6\u20139), HIV-1 must have evolved to achieve the desired \u20131FS efficiency at the concentrations of tRNAUAALeu prevalent in human cells. The UUA codon is rare in the human genome, as are all other A-ending codons. The respective cognate tRNAUAALeu is significantly underrepresented in the tRNA pool as compared to tRNACAGLeu that reads the abundant CUG codon (Figure 4) (53). While in eukaryotes the tRNA expression is tissue-specific, the relative expression of tRNA isoacceptors in some tissues shows statistically significant correlation to the codon usage of tissue-specific genes (69). The low relative abundance of tRNAUAALeu in the lymphocyte-derived cell types may be a result of adaptation to the codon usage in these cells. On the other hand, the rare UUA codon accounts for 45% of all Leu codons in late-expressing HIV-1 genes including gag and pol (70\u201372). Expression of the late HIV genes would increase the demand for a tRNAUAALeu that is rare in the respective cells, which may delay the decoding at any UUA codon, including the key codon in the slippery sequence. When the delivery to the UUA codon at the slippery site is too slow, the ribosome switches to the FFR route leading to robust \u20131FS. The codon usage disparity between HIV and its human host can be utilized to disrupt the late stage of virus production (73). For example, the interferon-induced antiviral protein Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) selectively abrogates the expression of late viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner (73). SLFN11 induces specific cleavage of tRNAs with a long variable loop, which include all serine and leucine tRNAs. If the already rare tRNA, such as tRNAUAALeu, is further reduced, tRNA availability might manifest as the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of proteins involving those tRNAs (73). A tRNA-dependent modulation of frameshifting was also reported within the expanded CAG stretch in the huntingtin gene (74): the translation of expanded CAG repeats in mutant huntingtin exon 1 leads to a depletion of charged Gln-tRNACUGGln that pairs to the CAG codon, which results in translational frameshifting. The frameshifting frequency varies strongly among different cell lines and is higher in cells with intrinsically lower concentrations of tRNACUGGln (74), which emphasizes the biological significance of tRNA concentrations in modulating frameshifting efficiencies.",

            "text": "Anti-HIV therapy with protease inhibitors leads to accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 protease that impair the recognition of its specific cleavage sites. To allow for polyprotein maturation by the mutated protease, secondary mutations arise at the pSS2, which harbors the p1/p6 cleavage site of Gag polyprotein (75\u201379). The C5U mutation in pSS2 substitutes Leu with Phe, which enhances van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the mutant protease, thereby increasing the protease activity by about 10-fold (80). The same mutation produces a slippery sequence that can support \u20131FS, but the role of pSS2 depends on the sequence of SS1. With native SS1, the joint activity of SS1 and pSS2 is not different from SS1 alone, but when SS1 is mutated to a non-shifty sequence, the C5U mutation in the pSS2 is sufficient to support a level of \u20131FS that may be sufficient for virus propagation. The finding that pSS2 can alleviate the detrimental effects of SS1 mutations is consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo reports (26\u201330). Interestingly, during antiviral therapy, drug-resistant herpes simplex viruses also develop an unusual slippery site that supports both \u20131 and +1FS at levels sufficient for virus replication and pathogenicity despite the treatment (81,82). Similarly, the C5U mutation in the pSS2 of gag-pol HIV-1 mRNA does not only modulate the FS efficiency, but also improves the activity of mutant proteases that emerge upon protease inhibitor treatment. The evolutionary pressure that has led to the conservation of pSS2 in HIV-1 is not known, but this sequence seems to allow rapid adaptation to anti-viral therapy (31). Thus, HIV-1 constitutively uses different FS regimes that have evolved to ensure a low but crucial level of FS required for its proliferation.",
