However, the gold-standard methods for detecting viral infections, non-molecular methods, have critical limitations such as the requirement of labor-intensive and complex procedures and time-consuming steps [12]. Therefore, in many instances, cell culture is no longer considered the gold-standard method, and molecular assays have become the standard of care for diagnosis [13]. Multiplex real-time PCR is useful for diagnosing respiratory viral infections because the process time is faster than that of viral culture, it detects multiple pathogenic viruses simultaneously, and it is reliable [3].",

It covers adenovirus (AdV); coronavirus 229E (229E), coronavirus NL63 (NL63), and coronavirus OC43 (OC43); FluA and influenza B virus (FluB); human bocavirus 1/2/3/4 (HBoV); human enterovirus (HEV); human metapneumovirus (MPV); human rhinovirus A/B/C (HRV); parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV2), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), and parainfluenza virus 4 (PIV4); and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA) and respiratory syncytial virus B (RSVB). Additionally, it is a one-step PCR assay and is therefore much simpler than other commercial multiplex PCR assays for respiratory viruses. Thus, we evaluated the performance of All16 compared with Anyplex II RV16 (Any16, Seegene), which also detects 16 viruses without FluA subtyping. Additionally, we analyzed the test time and hands-on time from the start of nucleic acid extraction until result acquisition.",

Nucleic acids were extracted and prepared for PCR using the STARMag 48\u00d78 Virus Cartridge Kit (Seegene) and MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). All samples were first tested with Any16 followed by All16, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further analyzed using monoplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), with the same primer pairs as for All16 and Any16, and the FluA genotyping results of All16 were compared with hemagglutinin gene sequencing results. FluA subtyping results of the 26 samples with FluA positivity in All16 were compared with the results of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel (FilmArray, BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).",

The MuDT technology saves time because the melting curve analysis step is unnecessary. A 2.2-hour reduction in the test time for All16 is achieved, regardless of the sample number, compared with Any16; this finding reflects the application of MuDT and a one-step process, including PCR and cDNA synthesis, in All16 compared with the two-step analysis, including PCR amplification after cDNA synthesis, used in Any16. Reduction of the hands-on time, workload, and test time because of the simple one-step analysis with MuDT used in All16 is helpful in clinical laboratories.",

However, slight discrepancies were observed for HEV and PIV3; discrepancies in HEV results might reflect low viral loads or primer competition. Any16 detected more positive results for HEV than that by All16. The analytical sensitivity of All16 is reported as 50 copies/\u00b5L, except for when PIV1 is analyzed, yielding a sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction, and when PIV4 and MPV are analyzed, with a sensitivity of 103 copies/reaction [7]. In contrast, the sensitivity of Any16 under the same conditions is approximately 6 copies/\u00b5L [8]. Based on the manufacturer's package inserts, the analytical sensitivities of Any16 and All16 are 50 copies/reaction and 100 copies/reaction, respectively. Therefore, HEV results were consistent with the package inserts. Additionally, Any16 involves a two-step analysis with PCR following cDNA synthesis. Separation of the cDNA synthesis step from PCR might have influenced HEV RNA purity or extraction, but other RNA virus results were inconsistent with this. Therefore, we speculate that the results were likely due to primer competition.",
