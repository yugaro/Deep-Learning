The genomic diversity of these phages is high, and there are many groups (\u201cclusters\u201d) that share little or no nucleotide sequence information (1, 5). Currently, 20 clusters have been described (clusters A to T), as well as nine singletons, i.e., phages for which relatives have yet to be identified (2, 3). Genomes within a cluster generally share nucleotide sequence identity spanning greater than 50% of genome length, but there is considerable diversity within most of the clusters, and many can be readily divided into subclusters based on relative nucleotide sequence similarity (5); the largest group, cluster A, currently is divided into 11 subclusters (2).",

In contrast, the mycobacterial hosts M. smegmatis mc2155 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv have high GC contents\u2014with 67.4% and 65.6% GC, respectively\u2014typical of the genus Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium leprae is atypically low with 57.8%) (6). However, other species within the family Mycobacteriaceae span a broader percent GC range, including Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, with 52.2% GC, and Corynebacterium variabile, having 67.2% GC. The percent GC correlates closely with cluster designation (1), but those with the lowest percent GC are relatively rarely isolated, including the singleton Patience (50.3%) and the five cluster H phages (average, 57.3% GC). The genome diversity and percent GC range of the mycobacteriophages support a model for phage genome evolution in which phages migrate much more rapidly across a diverse bacterial landscape than their genomes ameliorate toward that of any one host (4). Thus, mycobacteriophages at the lower end of the percent GC spectrum are predicted to have infected lower-GC hosts in their recent evolutionary pasts (4). We note that there are other phage-host systems with mismatched GC contents, such as T4 and the right arm of phage lambda (35.3% and 44.4%, respectively), relative to their Escherichia coli host (50.8%).",

Many have no tRNA genes, and some have only one or a small number, while others\u2014such as the members of clusters C and M\u2014have more than 20 (7, 8). The rationale for carriage of these is unclear, and there is no obvious correlation between tRNA content and percent GC that might reflect tRNA acquisition to augment gene expression in newly acquired hosts. It has been noted that there is no close correlation between the tRNA specificities encoded by D29 and infrequently used codons (9) or between Bxz1 and phage codon preferences of putative high-expression genes (10). Analysis of the codon usage of 32 mycobacteriophage genomes showed that there is variation in codon usage preferences (11). In some phage genomes, the tRNAs may counteract host measures to protect themselves from infection by tRNA destruction (12).",

Of the predicted 109 Patience protein-coding genes, 61% are \u201corphams\u201d with no close mycobacteriophage relatives in the Phamerator_285 database, and most of the 48 genes with homologues in other mycobacteriophages are most closely related to those in clusters H, R, and D, which also have below-average GC contents. However, Patience has a distinctly different codon usage profile from both its host and other mycobacteriophages and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in the host. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry provides evidence for expression of at least 83 Patience proteins, two of which are from cryptic open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes. We propose that Patience is a relatively recent visitor to the Mycobacterium neighborhood, having evolved primarily in lower-GC hosts within the Actinomycetales, and is in the process of adapting to growth in its new high-GC genetic environment.",

Isolation and purification of Patience were components of a 2-week workshop on mycobacterial genetics offered in July 2009; the genome was sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh and annotated in a second 2-week workshop at UKZN in July 2011. Patience forms normal-size hazy (~1-mm-diameter) plaques on M. smegmatis mc2155 at 37\u00b0C under standard conditions, although we have been unsuccessful in recovering stable lysogens. It can easily be propagated on solid media to titers greater than 1010 PFU/ml. The genome is 70,506 bp long, circularly permuted, and presumably terminally redundant. For linear presentation, coordinate 1 is designated the beginning of an open reading frame upstream of the large terminase subunit consistent with the organization of the cluster H phages that contain homologues of the first open reading frame at their left ends (7). The GenBank submission (JN412589) has been reported previously (3). Genome annotation identified 109 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and one tRNA gene (Table 1); one additional ORF was annotated using mass spectrometry analysis (see below).",

This is atypically long not only because of the long tape measure gene corresponding to the long phage tail but because of a dozen genes of mostly unknown function located between the terminase large subunit (gene 6) and portal (gene 8) genes, between the portal (gene 8) and protease (gene 19) genes, and between the MuF-like gene (gene 20) and the putative scaffolding gene (gene 22) (Fig. 5); most of these are orphams (i.e., they do not have a close mycobacteriophage relative), with the exceptions of genes 10 and 18 (Fig. 5). Gene 7 encodes a putative Endo VII protein and has weak similarity (<30% identity) to genes in phages Konstantine and Predator (subcluster H1), as well as Dori (singleton).

Using stringent criteria for peptide identification, we identified 79 of the 109 previously annotated predicted gene products (82 different gene products, including previously unannotated genes) present in at least one of the samples, including 34 of the 35 putative virion structure and assembly proteins (genes 5 to 39), 27 of which are particle associated (Fig. 5). Although gp9 was not detected, particle-associated peptides corresponding to a previously unannotated 37-codon gene between genes 8 and 9 were identified, which we designate gene 111 (Fig. 5). Particles contain four additional products, gp1, gp4, gp79, and gp86, although gp86 is abundant in lytic growth and the few particle-associated peptides could be contaminants in the phage preparation (Table S1). The capsid subunit (gp23) appears to be proteolytically cleaved between residues 82 and 83 to generate a 35.3-kDa mature protein product; that and the gp31 major tail subunit (30.5 kDa) and gp15 (32 kDa) likely correspond to the three major species observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that\u2014with the exception of 31-residue gp9\u2014all of the genes corresponding to insertions within the otherwise canonically syntenic virion structure and assembly operon are present in Patience particles, although only 3 spectra of gp21 were identified and could represent contaminants from the lysate (Fig. 5; Table S1).",

A total of 17 instances of seven different peptides were identified, and the spectra and fragmentation tables strongly support the peptide assignments (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Moreover, 10 peptides correspond to the extreme N terminus with the methionine present, and there is a strong ribosome binding site upstream (Fig. S2). Although the protein is seemingly expressed, the functional relevance is unclear. The predicted product has no close database relatives, and the evidence for conservation is ambiguous (Fig. S1A). Barnyard contains a similar open reading frame within its polymerase, and the products share 30% amino acid identity, whereas the corresponding segments of the polymerases share only 53% identity.

If Patience currently exploits more GC-rich hosts, then it would experience not only mutational biases, which would increase its GC content, but selective pressure on its most highly expressed genes to use tRNA pools poised to translate GC-rich genes. This selective pressure would be reflected in a preferred usage of GC-rich codons within highly expressed genes. Patience does experience codon selection, which is shown by the robust positive correlation between codon selection (adapative codon enrichment [ACEz] [25]) (see Materials and Methods) and level of gene expression, using total numbers of peptides as identified by mass spectrometry under stringent conditions as a surrogate for expression (Fig. 6B). Codon selection is measured using \u03b4 values, or the ratio of codon frequencies in genes experiencing codon selection normalized to their frequencies in genes lacking codon selection. Preferred codons are those with \u03b4 values greater than 1, indicating more frequent use in genes experiencing codon selection, frequently those expressed to greater levels. Patience favors the use of GC-rich codons in genes experiencing codon selection (Table 2), with 24 of 33 preferred codons bearing GC base pairs in their third positions, whereas 21 of 26 nonpreferred codons end with AT base pairs. Moreover, the patterns of codon preference in Patience (which codons are preferred and which are not) are strongly correlated with that of M. smegmatis (Fig. 6C), suggesting that this host imposes codon selection congruent with that currently being experienced by Patience. In contrast, Patience codon selection is not congruent with that imposed by hosts with more moderate GC content, such as Escherichia coli (Fig. 6C, inset), although such surveys can never be conclusive.",

Its overall GC content and codon usage profiles are distinctly different from those of its mycobacterial host, suggesting that it primarily evolved in a moderate-GC (~50%) environment. Growth in high-GC bacteria may have required multiple events, including acquisition of part of a tail gene (gene 47) by lateral gene transfer. Nonetheless, the mismatch between viral and host genomic profiles does not appear to have been a substantial impediment to host range expansion, although the highly expressed viral genes are under codon selection for more efficient translation by the host apparatus. Interestingly, although Patience conceivably could have responded by acquisition of a tRNA repertoire to facilitate phage gene expression, this has not occurred; the only phage-carried tRNA is tRNAGln(UUG), and CAA is not a rare codon in the Patience genome (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).",

Moreover, a previously unannotated gene was identified (gene 111) containing only 37 codons, and the revision of start codons indicates that two pairs of genes have significant overlaps (>60 bp). Phage genome annotation is generally more error-prone than that of other genomes because of the abundance of small open reading frames and relatively small gene size (average mycobacteriophage gene length is 640 bp). HPLC-MS/MS adds confidence to genome annotation, especially for phages such as Patience, whose coding potential does not closely match its bacterial host. It is surprising to find that at least two reading frames embedded out of frame within annotated genes are also expressed. These ORFs are generally not conserved and may not express functional products, but an intriguing possibility is that this expression is a consequence of movement into higher-GC hosts, presenting a small reservoir of new products available for selection and further adaption at little evolutionary cost.

Their codon usage profiles (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material) more closely reflect those of the lower-GC mycobacteriophages such as Patience. Patience may share gene content with phages of such hosts, but to date, few have been characterized, other than some prophages such as phage Beta of C. diphtheriae (27, 28).

Next, adaptive codon enrichment (ACEu) values (25) are calculated for all genes as described previously (25), using this table to represent codon frequencies under codon selection (fo) and the frequencies of codons among all genes in the Patience genome to represent codon frequencies expected from mutational processes alone (fN). High ACEu values are shown by genes which favor codons which are overrepresented in the fo table relative to the fN table. Those genes with the highest ACEu values were used to construct another codon table; this process was repeated 50 times, reducing the size of the table to 5,000 codons total. Codon selection was measured as \u03b4 values (25), where \u03b4 = fo/fN for each codon. Preferred codons show \u03b4 values greater than 1.0.",

Phage particles were allowed to adsorb for 15 min, and then 4.5 ml of fresh 7H9 medium was added to the culture and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 37\u00b0C; the OD600 was monitored throughout to follow cell growth and lysis. At 30 min and 150 min postadsorption, a 1-ml aliquot was removed from the culture, the cells were pelleted via centrifugation (1 min, 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and then shipped overnight on wet ice to the University of California, Davis Proteomics Core (UCDPC) (http://proteomics.ucdavis.edu). There, the cells were lysed via a MagNA Lyser, the insoluble fraction was removed, and the soluble proteins were precipitated, digested with trypsin, and cleaned up using a MacroSpin column. The peptides were then separated using an Easy-LC II high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and loaded into a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo) for tandem MS analysis. Detected spectra and fragmentation profiles were matched against a database comprised of a six-frame translation of the Patience genome, the annotated proteins of M. smegmatis mc2155, and UniProt using X! Tandem. Peptide matches were analyzed using Scaffold4. The \u201cRelaxed\u201d settings (as reported in Table S1 in the supplemental material) used a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and a protein FDR of 5%; the \u201cStringent\u201d settings used a peptide FDR of 0.1% and a protein FDR of 0.6%.
