            "text": "Previous studies have shown that the metabolism of L-arginine is one of the important mechanisms underlying the regulation of immune responses (5,6). L-arginine is a substrate of arginase (Arg), including Arg I and II, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), including NOS1, 2 and 3). Arg I and II hydrolyzes L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea, and L-ornithine is further metabolized into polyamines, which are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells (7). NOS catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine into citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), and NO is an important effector and regulator of the immune system (8,9). Arg I is released from immune cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils, during inflammation, and is also involved in the inflammatory response (10). NOS2, or inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in a variety of immune cells (11). Studies have reported that Arg I regulates the bioavailability of L-arginine, which is involved in certain immune-associated pathological processes, including inflammation-triggered immune dysfunction, immune evasion of cancer cells, fibrosis, immunosuppression and immune responses to infectious agents (5,11,12). As a competitor to Arg I, iNOS hydrolyzes L-arginine into NO, which is important in destroying parasites, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells, as well as in vascular dilation (13\u201315).",

In addition, peripheral superficial biopsies of the LNs were collected from the neck and armpit of 13 subjects without HIV infection, recruited from the 302 Hospital of PLA, and were processed for pathological examination by two experienced pathologists. Exclusion criteria included the presence of cancer, infection and autoimmune diseases, and the presence of reactive hyperplasia was confirmed in those subjects who then served as controls.

This mechanism is important in the immunosuppression of certain inflammation-associated conditions. For example, certain cancer cells and pathogens, including Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii, may use arginine to induce inflammation-associated immune suppression, leading to immune evasion (12,31,32,39). In the NOS pathway, L-arginine is metabolized by iNOS into citrulline and NO, and NO is important in the destruction of cancer cells, viruses, bacteria and parasites and in regulation of a variety of immune cells (40). NOS has three isoforms, which include two constitutive isoforms, neural NOS and endothelial NOS, and one inducible isoform (iNOS) (41). Constitutive NOS is predominantly involved in the physiological synthesis of NO and the regulation of different physiological functions, and its activity is Ca2+-dependent (42). However, iNOS is predominantly involved in the immune regulation and pro-inflammatory response (43,44).",

A reduction in L-arginine causes a decrease in NO through the iNOS pathway (11). The competition between Arg and iNOS is pivotal in the immune response to infection and determines the course of infection. For example, the peritoneal macrophages in rats differ from those in mice by being resistant to Toxoplasma gondi infection in nature. This resistance has been ascribed to the increased expression and activity of iNOS and, reduced activity of Arg I in rat peritoneal macrophages, compared with mouse peritoneal macrophages (12). HIV infection significantly reduces the number of CD4+ T cells, particularly in the AIDS phase, and as polyamine, which is the metabolic product of L-arginine by Arg, is an essential substrate for cell proliferation, increased Arg I in the peripheral blood and LNs can increase the number of CD4+ T cells following HIV infection (11). The results of the present study indicated the negative correlation between the expression of Arg I in peripheral T cells and LNs and peripheral CD4+ T cell count, suggesting that the expression of Arg I increased to compensate for the reduction in CD4+ T cells.",

Thus, the increase in the expression levels of Arg I in the peripheral blood and LNs of HIV-infected patients may cause a reduction in the expression of iNOS. This Arg-induced reduction in iNOS synthesis leads to a reduction in the production of NO, and this release of NO by macrophages is important role in innate immunity (11). The reduced synthesis of NO may directly impair innate immunity and affect anti-infection ability, increasing immune dysfunction in HIV-infected patients. This may contribute to the increased replication of HIV and reduced anti-infection ability in patients with AIDS, causing opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculosis, cytomegalo-virus and Epstein-Barr virus. Furthermore, the consumption of L-arginine by Arg causes downregulated expression of the CD3\u03b6 chain in CD8+ T cells (6,45,46). All these factors contribute to the significant increase in HIV replication and compromise anti-infection ability in the AIDS phase, resulting in the development of opportunistic infections.",

Thus, as an important metabolic enzyme, which affects NO synthesis, mechanisms to inhibit the progression of disease by inhibiting Arg activity and functional interference remains an area of increased interest. Certain synthetic and natural compounds that inhibit Arg have been investigated as disease therapies, with certain small molecule inhibitors of Arg showing potential in the treatment of diabetes, allergic inflammation and Schistosoma mansoni parasitic infection (47,51,52). At the same time, evidence in rats shows that Arg I may serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (53). The results of the present study also showed that HIV load and peripheral CD4+ T cells were independently associated with the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS. Thus, although HAART may exert therapeutic effects by reducing the expression of Arg I and increasing the expression of iNOS, Arg inhibitors may be used as an adjuvant therapy to treat HIV infection, particularly in those with AIDS, and to improve immune function, prevent opportunistic infections and inhibit viral replication. In addition, this correlation suggests that the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral T cells may be used diagnostically to predict the progression of HIV infections.",
