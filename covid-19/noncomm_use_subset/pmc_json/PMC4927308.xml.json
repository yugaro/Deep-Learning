The IISP reflects ILI in the outpatient setting; thus, our analysis does not capture PIV patients with non-ILI presentation. However, we found that among a limited number of sites conducting surveillance including all ARI patients, 79% of the PIV-positive patients reported ILI symptoms within the 7 days before the clinical visit. As a more sensitive case definition, we expect that surveillance of ARI patients would have produced greater numbers of PIV cases than ILI surveillance; however because of decreased specificity, the percent positivity of PIV among ARI patients would be lower than among ILI patients. Surveillance for PIVs was reduced in the 2013\u20132014 surveillance year from 12 to 5 participating health departments, leading to decreased PIV detections for that year; although PIV data from 2013 to 2014 was consistent with previous surveillance years, the analysis may have been subject to bias related to decreased specimen collection and testing. Finally, although all sites used sensitive and specific reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assays for PIV detection, small differences between the assays may have resulted in minor differences in PIV detection.",

            "text": "It is well-established that PIVs contribute substantially to ILI morbidity and hospitalization among children, being second only to respiratory syncytial virus in hospitalizations because of respiratory tract infections among children aged <5 years.2,3,6,16,25 Here we use population-based surveillance data to calculate the incidence of ILI visits and demonstrate the appreciable contribution of PIVs to respiratory illness among children in the outpatient setting. Although PIVs are the leading cause of croup and contribute substantially to rates of upper and lower respiratory tract disease among children, there are currently no available antivirals or vaccines to treat PIV infection. Because PIV infections may be clinically indistinguishable from other ILI etiologies, it is important that surveillance be conducted to provide a resource to inform clinicians of viral circulation. We demonstrated the consistent seasonality and high-risk age groups which may help outpatient providers to better identify the etiology of PIV-related illness. Furthermore, population-based estimates of the incidence of PIV-associated outpatient ILI visits improve our understanding of the circulation and burden of PIV and support efforts for the prevention and treatment of infections, including the development of a PIV vaccine for very young children.",
