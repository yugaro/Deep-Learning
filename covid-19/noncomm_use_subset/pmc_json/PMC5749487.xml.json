Mathematical models are effective for understanding and controlling the spread of MERS-CoV, and so far, many attempts at applying mathematical models have been made to understand the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea [1\u20139]. The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. Using a mathematical model, we investigated whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy.",

In particular, these results were evident from the average and standard deviation, which were smaller in the early intervention period. The difference was markedly larger 100 days after the identification of the index case, and the difference in the effect of the intervention over time showed a decreasing trend.",

As a result, the intervention on the 20th day after the identification of the index case was much better than the intervention on the 60th day.
