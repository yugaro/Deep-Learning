For instance, in the case of Zika, it was essential to understand the disease early in the epidemic through the autopsy case report of a conceptus with microcephaly, whose mother acquired the disease in northeastern Brazil. It was possible to describe macroscopy and microscopy of the brain in detail, to observe the agent by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy in the lesions, and to sequence the viral strain obtained in the brain tissue, determining its phylogeny.3 Subsequently, works by Chimelli et al.4 and Martines et al.5 demonstrated that the Zika virus can produce a myriad of lesions in the central and peripheral nervous system due to a change in neuronal development, maturation, and migration, as well as lesions in the maternal placenta. The amount of research accumulated in Zika since the beginning of the epidemic is huge, and the pathology of infectious diseases plays a decisive role. More recently, during the yellow fever epidemic in Brazil from 2017 to 2019, previous and current pathology studies have allowed a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.6-9 In our region, where hemorrhagic fevers are endemic (e.g., dengue, leptospirosis, spotted fever, hantavirus, sepsis), the emergence of yellow fever has become a problem for clinicians and epidemiologists. The pathologist\u2019s action is decisive for the definition and exclusion of suspected cases, especially fatal ones, allowing accurate knowledge of the mortality rate and the magnitude of the problem.",

In general, the literature describes the pathology caused by pyogenic bacteria, whether gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli, as a suppurative inflammatory process, which is indistinguishable between agents regardless of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.10 In particular, I disagree with this point of view, at least partially. Little is known about the pathology of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and studies\u2014even case reports\u2014are extremely welcome as is Larry Nichols\u2019 report Death from pan-resistant superbug, in this issue of Autopsy & Case Reports, describing the autopsy of a \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficient patient who was a chronic corticosteroid user and developed fatal pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to all tested antibiotics.11 The description of the pathology of multi-resistant pyogenic agents may raise relevant insights for understanding the pathogenesis of infection and the virulence of an agent. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a gram-negative bacillus, which causes pyogenic infection, with a particular vascular tropism inducing coagulative vessel necrosis and ischemic tissue damage.12",

Some hypotheses may arise for this morphological scenario, which may be answered in the future by controlled experimental studies: is the macrophage response effective in destroying A. baumannii? Are the macrophages present type M1 or M2? Are the neutrophil response, complement, and antibodies compromised? It should be considered that the patient was a chronic user of corticosteroids. However, are there particularities in A. baumannii virulence? Some of these pathogenetic responses, if answered, may allow the discovery of new therapies. Therefore, the relevance of a detailed description of the pathology of multi-resistant superbugs. As a note, some autopsies of A. baumannii pneumonia recently performed by Departamento de Patologia \u2013 Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (personal observation, unpublished data), present the same morphological findings as described by Nichols. Of course, detailed pathology studies with larger numbers of resistant bacteria with different phenotypic susceptibility patterns would provide more information on pathogenesis. Perhaps it would only be possible through the interaction between different health centers around the world.",

Moreover, the pathology of infectious diseases is part of preparedness in case of an epidemic, as it defines or excludes the diagnosis of a disease. With this medical and social function, the pathology of infectious diseases can reach the fullness of its importance with the autopsy, when the pathologist examines all organs of a fatal case, allowing him/her to determine the mechanism of transmission, the mechanism of injury through the involvement of all organ systems, and to determine the cause of death. Of equal importance, the pathologist can characterize the individual\u2019s in situ immune response, and predict the prognosis of an infectious disease and the therapeutic response by analyzing tissue damage.20-22",

Perhaps it is in the field of infectious diseases where the great importance of EM still lies, and it is worth maintaining the technique and art of this old ancillary method. EM can elucidate difficult cases by discovering the etiology of a disease (especially viruses), in glutaraldehyde-fixed or paraffin-embedded tissues during epidemics, where immunohistochemistry antibodies or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers are not yet available.24 Molecular biology techniques such as in situ hybridization, PCR and gene sequencing\u2014including next generation sequencing\u2014are new methods that can be used with frozen or fixed tissues; however, these techniques are not always available in resource-poor regions (Figure 2).25",
