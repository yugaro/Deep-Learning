Hall and later Brenner and Horne used phosphotungstic acid for contrasting plant viruses.8,12 This technique was extended in 1959 to coliphage T2.9 Viruses and their components stood out as white on a dark background with unprecedented clarity. Negative staining by phosphotungstates rapidly superseeded shadowing for virus visualization. Uranyl salts and ammonium molybdate were introduced later. The standards of viral electron microscopy were set in the 1970s.11,20,21 Today, negative staining is done almost exclusively with uranyl acetate (UA) and phosphotungstate (PT) salts (Figs. 1\nand\n2) and has been applied to thousands of viruses. At present, at least 6,300 bacterial and archaeal viruses have been examined in the electron microscope after negative staining.6",

These instruments were marketed almost simultanously by three major competing companies that did so with meager or no instructions relating to contrast and image quality. An additional modification by microscope manufacturers was to change the focal length of the objective pole piece (zeta or Z angle) to increase fidelity at the cost of reduced contrast. All these factors could explain a wave of poor electron microscopical images1 which, seemingly, has not abated. Unfortunately, this wave coincided with the death of several famous and highly skilled electron microscopists, such as E. Kellenberger in Switzerland, D.E. Bradley in Canada, and A.S. Tikhonenko in Russia, who could have stemmed the tide.",

The adjectives \u201cpoor and good\u201d are somewhat subjective and we apologize for this.

One also finds a few old AEM (England) and Tesla (Czechia) instruments. The prevalence of JEOL and Hitachi instruments may be attributed to their relatively low cost. The most popular types are the JEOL 1200 EX, the Hitachi H-1700, and three instruments of the Philips family (FEI CM 100, Technai Spirit or Morgagni). A few \u201cmanual\u201d microscopes, for example the Philips EM 300, persist and seem to be, because of their high quality, the objects of a cult among inconditionals of electron microscopy. FEI-Tecnai electron microscopes appear to be the most highly evolved TEMs and have indeed produced excellent micrographs, whereas, for example, the JEOL 1200 is often associated with poor pictures. This impression is superficial. Indeed, good and poor pictures have been produced with JEOL, Hitachi and Philips-FEI instruments.

Crude lysates contain huge amounts of impurities, notably proteins (Figs. S4 and S19). This results in contrastless, flat images and the presence of bacterial debris and even complete bacteria. The debris may mimic certain types of bacteriophages (Table 2). Images of nonpurified specimens should not be accepted for publication. Purification can be achieved by centrifugation in sucrose or CsCl density gradients; unfortunately, this technique is limited to a small number of specialized laboratories. Instead, we recommend to sediment phages in Eppendorf tubes followed by two washes in buffer or even tap water. Using fixed-angle rotors, phages can be sedimented in as little as 1 h at 25,000 g. It is not necessary to stain phages for long minutes or to fix them. Staining is almost instantaneous and fixation is merely a complication. While purification is mandatory for any real investigation, crude lysates can be examined for quick checks of phage presence and identity. It is also possible to examine phages extracted from a lysed agar surface.23 For this, a drop of staining solution is deposited on the agar and the Petri dish is agitated gently. The drop is then touched with a grid and excess liquid is drawn off.",

Both focusing and astigmatism correction can go wrong and produce unsharp images. Much has been said in manuals of electron microscopy (e.g., in ref. 7) about focusing and astigmatism and this does not need to be repeated. Digital microscopes allow the investigator to use the FFT (Fast fourier transform) function as a measure of astigmatism (Fig. 3). This function is available in FEI, Hitachi, and JEOL instruments and, for example, the widespread AMT, Gatan, and OlympusSis cameras. If fuzziness and astigmatism persist, the electron microscope should be checked by the installer.

Finally, contrast can be improved in the darkroom by means of fast developers, polycontrast papers and optical filters. Unfortunately, this is very difficult with \u201cdigital\u201d electron microscopes where contrast must be adjusted before or after image acquisition. CCD digital technology offers a wide range of gray scale values. They can be selected to favor the mid-tonal range, thus reducing the extreme dark and white values. For example, a 12-bit image comprises 4,096 levels from black to white. If the software is set to adjust the predominant intensity to a middle tonality, all values will be adjusted accordingly. The mid-tones typically yield low-contrast images. Contrast levels should therefore be set to exclude a given percentage of black and white outliers. After image acquisition, the histogram camera software allows for adjustments of gamma (a function of luminance), contrast, and brightness.19 The observer is left to find his or her best combination by trial and error. Contrast may also be improved by third-party software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop or Image J; http//rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). This seems often to be misunderstood or ignored. Poorly contrasted digital images should be a thing of the past.",

It might be acceptable if phage researchers themselves have access to the electron microscope used or the technician that carries our investigations, is properly qualified or backed by an experienced phage researcher.

Uranyl salts cause both negative and positive staining, while phosphotungstates and molybdates cause negative staining only (Table 1). The principal incriminated stain is uranyl acetate (UA). In positive staining (Figs. S9 and S13), virus particles themselves are stained and then may appear black on a white background. This is due to the strong affinity of uranyl ions to dsDNA13 and seen in any viruses with compact masses of DNA, e.g., phage heads and adeno- or herpes-viruses. It never occurs in filamentous or ssRNA phages. Positively stained phage heads are invariably shrunken by about 10\u201315%5,16 and show neither capsomers nor transverse edges. Phage tails are not stained and appear as shadows. Consequently, these viruses can rarely be identified by EM. Their dimensions are perfectly useless and should not be published. If positive staining is generally an undesirable artifact, it has however two important applications. It allows (A) the visualization of phage heads in sectioned bacteria and (B) facilitates the quantification of aquatic viruses.4 The reasons for positive staining are unknown. Both negative and positive staining may occur in adjacent areas of the same EM grid (Figs. S10, S12 and S13).

CsCl forms flat crystals, but does not interfere with staining. Arborescent or flat NaCl crystals are frequent in lysates from halophilic bacteria which require NaCl for growth, e.g., Vibrio and Halobacterium. Again, bacteriophages may act as nuclei of crystallization (Fig. S18). NaCl crystals may obscure phage particles, but do not alter the quality of staining. In lysates from bacteria prepared with meat-based media, e.g., of clostridia, one may observe occasional fibers of striated muscle and bundles of double-walled rings which resemble phage tails (Fig. S41) and may be be attributed to self-assembly under the action of phospholipase C.3",

The past five years have generated scores of strange publications. Some investigators of soil phages saw novel viruses in every round or oval particle or isolated tail sheath, others interpreted particles with contracted and extended tails of the same Bacillus myovirus as members of different species, and still others confused negative and positive staining or myo-, sipho- and podo-viruses. This denotes a decline in the general knowledge of viruses and of bacteriophages in particular. Misdiagnosis is particularly frequent in the interpretation of natural samples (water, soil and feces) because these may contain almost anything: algal, plant and vertebrate viruses, muscle fibers, abiogenic material, and of course the omnipresent bacterial debris of any kind. Ultimately, the human factor is the root cause of most problems: failure to maintain, repair and align an electron microscope; failure to focus properly and to correct astigmatism; improper or no specimen preparation; failure to recognize artifacts and fake viruses; absence of magnification control; finally failure to consult the now very abundant literature on electron microscopy in general and that on phages in particular.
