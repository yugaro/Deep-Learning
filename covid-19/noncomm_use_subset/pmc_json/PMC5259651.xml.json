Haptoglobin showed a more gradual increase and decrease and therefore did not reflect clinical recovery as well as CRP and SAA. Because there is a wider range of concentrations and the magnitude of change is more pronounced in SAA compared to CRP, SAA might be a better diagnostic and follow\u2010up marker than CRP in dogs with BP, as already suggested by a recent study comparing CRP and SAA as diagnostic markers of systemic inflammation.45\n",

            "text": "C\u2010reactive protein continued to increase within the first 24 hours in 5 dogs. This is not unexpected because dogs with BP were presented acutely and CRP is known to reach peak concentrations approximately 24 hours after the onset of an inflammatory stimulus.48 Consequently, it is not meaningful to interpret the possible CRP decrease as early as 24 hours after initiation of treatment. However, a decrease in serum CRP is expected 48\u201372 hours after initiation of successful treatment, and a failure to show a decrease has been associated with a poor prognosis in dogs with systemic inflammatory conditions.22, 23, 24 Consecutive measurements of CRP have been to be found useful in humans with CAP, and the magnitude of CRP decrease at days 3 and 4 has been shown to have prognostic value.49, 50, 51 A connection also has been shown between the pattern of serum CRP concentrations and outcome in humans. Patients with persistently high CRP (so\u2010called nonresponse) or an increase in serum CRP after an initial decrease (so\u2010called biphasic response) during the first days of hospitalization had a poor prognosis.52 In our study, the CRP ratio, describing the magnitude of decrease after 48 or 72 hours, did not correlate with the duration of hospitalization. This finding could be a consequence of the small number of samples available for CRP measurement at 72 hours: Only 5 dogs with msBP were still alive and hospitalized 72 hours after presentation. Another limitation concerns the method used for CRP measurements. The upper detection limit for the assay used was 210 mg/L, and measurements exceeding this concentration were set at 211 mg/L. Doing so underestimated the increase in serum CRP, because it has been shown that serum CRP can increase markedly above 211 mg/L in dogs with aspiration pneumonia.45 This approach will affect the interpretation of the CRP ratio during the recovery process. These limitations make the interpretation of the CRP ratio in our study less informative. One dog, which was euthanized because of refractory BP, had a biphasic CRP response pattern similar to that described in connection with poor prognosis in humans with CAP.52\n",

Respiratory samples in dogs with msBP were characterized by significantly more pronounced neutrophilia, eosinopenia, and lymphopenia compared to dogs with lsBP. These variables therefore could be useful as early markers aiding in the identification of dogs with a more severe course of BP. Escherichia coli as a causative agent additionally was correlated with a more severe course of BP. Moreover, coagulation abnormalities were detected only in dogs with msBP caused by E. coli. These findings likely are due to endotoxin produced by E. coli, affecting hemodynamics, blood clotting, and cellular and humoral immunity.53 A similar finding of increased disease severity has been described in E. coli\u2010induced CAP.54 Additionally, prolonged aPTT has been correlated with a worse prognosis in both humans and dogs with systemic inflammation or sepsis.55, 56\n",

However, because thoracic radiographs were not repeated daily, an exact time point for the resolution could not be determined. Alveolar infiltrates resolved relatively rapidly in our study (69% of dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10) compared to studies of humans. Only 33% of human patients with CAP had clearance of radiographic infiltrates at day 7 and 62% at day 28, and it also has been shown that radiographic normalization lags behind clinical cure as assessed by physicians.57, 58 With CAP, current research has not been able to show benefits for routinely repeating thoracic radiographs after clinical recovery.57, 58, 59 Repeating thoracic radiographs during and after hospitalization therefore is not recommended in patients with uncomplicated recovery.27 Additional information gained by thoracic radiographs, especially after the clearance of alveolar infiltrates, was minimal in our study in dogs with otherwise satisfactory clinical recovery.",

Antibiotics are recommended for 7\u201310 days in cases of mild\u2010to\u2010moderate CAP, and the use of biomarkers has proved useful in determining optimal treatment duration.27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 60 No published clinical studies exist addressing the optimal duration of antimicrobials in dogs with BP, and current recommendations may overestimate the treatment duration needed, especially in uncomplicated cases. Considering the variety of infectious agents and the individual differences in the interactions between microbe and the host immune system, a need also exists in dogs with BP for customizing antibiotic treatment duration according to disease severity and response rate. In our study, normalization of CRP was used to guide duration of antimicrobial treatment in 8 of 17 dogs and resulted in significantly decreased treatment duration compared to 9 of 17 conventionally treated dogs. It would have been ideal to randomize the chosen treatment regimen and stratify the randomization according to disease severity. Instead, conventional treatment was used at the beginning of the study, because previous information on the applicability of CRP to predict treatment duration was lacking. When clinical experience was gained and serum CRP was found to reflect the recovery process well, it was considered safe to stop administering antibiotics after CRP normalization. Ending antimicrobials at the point of CRP normalization was still considered premature and, to increase safety, antimicrobials were administered for 5\u20137 days after CRP normalization. Relapses of BP were not noted in dogs receiving a CRP\u2010guided course of antibiotics, and therefore, the approach appears to be safe. However, because the incidence of relapse was low in both groups, our study was not able to identify an optimal end point for antimicrobial treatment and even shorter courses than those used in the CRP\u2010guided group may have been sufficient in dogs with BP. Additionally, the small number of dogs and lack of randomization are limitations, and larger randomized studies are warranted.",
