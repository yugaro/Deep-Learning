            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. The mortality rate is higher in children under five years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (1, 2). The most common causative agents of ARTIs are viruses. Influenza A virus (IFV-A), influenza B virus (IFV-B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (AdV), and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequently reported viruses associated with ARTIs in the general population. However, their distribution varies by season, geographic region, and age group (3, 4).",

Early detection of related causative agents is crucial for providing an appropriate treatment regimen, decreasing the use of unnecessary antibiotics, limiting the spread of infection, and shortening the hospitalization duration (2, 3, 5). Different laboratory diagnostic methods are available for determining the causative pathogens related to ARTIs. The conventional methods, such as viral cell cultures and antigen detection tests (such as enzyme immunoassays and direct fluorescent antibody tests), are effective and often complementary, but they have some limitations. Although the cell culture technique is considered to be the gold standard for virus detection, the process is laborious and time-consuming, and it is almost impossible to obtain results during the acute phase of the disease. Antigen-detection tests can provide more rapid results, but are less sensitive and/or specific compared to cell culture techniques (5, 6).",

            "text": "Rapid and accurate identification of the viral agents of ARTIs is critically important in order to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy and to prevent the overuse of antibiotics, nosocomial transmission, and lengthy hospital stays (7, 13). Molecular techniques with higher sensitivity and rapidity play a critical role in the early identification of respiratory viral pathogens, particularly during epidemics (13). However, the virus-detection rate varies depending on the specimen type, the method used, the working group, and when the study was performed (2). In our study, nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 18 respiratory viruses and four bacteria by using a multiplex real-time PCR assay, and at least one agent was identified in 72.4% of the samples. This high positive detection rate is similar to the rates reported in other studies, in which molecular methods were performed (13-18). The results indicated that individuals in all age groups were susceptible to multiple respiratory viruses that simultaneously circulate in the community. Moreover, despite no significant differences, the detection rate of pathogens in children (75.1%) was slightly higher than in adults (70.9%) (Table 1). Previous reports suggested that positive detection rates (in the range of 30.9% - 96.1%) for respiratory viruses in pediatric groups were higher than in adult groups (19). Viral ARTIs have been suggested to occur more frequently in males (15, 20). Our data also showed a slight male preponderance (53.4%) among the positive cases, but the overall positive detection rate was not significantly different between male and female patients.",

In addition, the detection rates of IFV-A and IFV-B in adults were found to be significantly higher than in children. In contrast to our results, Javadi et al.

Similarly, Byington et al. (22) found that the detection of HBoV was not associated with clinical symptoms in 54% of cases. On the other hand, although nasopharyngeal samples were suggested to reveal reliable results for detecting viral agents, the findings described above may indicate that pathogen detection in the nasopharynx may not accurately represent the situation in the lower respiratory tract (14, 17, 18). Moreover, the possibility of contamination during sample collection or analysis could not be excluded, and this should be kept in mind in clinical evaluations. Assessment of viral load may be a better choice in the interpretation of positive co-infection results, but it has been reported that more studies would be required to clarify the potential value of quantitative test results (9). In addition, in most studies, it has been suggested that the presence of more than one pathogen in a respiratory sample did not affect the clinical presentation of ARTIs, but the relationship between co-infection and severity of disease remains debatable (4, 13-15, 19).",

            "text": "It is known that viral ARTIs have a seasonal character, particularly in regions with temperate climates, and the peak periods may change from year to year. In many studies, respiratory viruses have been reported to be active during the cold seasons (generally from November to March) in the Northern Hemisphere (20). In our study, interestingly, IFV-B was not detected in the autumn months or in December; it began to appear in January (Table 4, Figure 1). In contrast, IFV-A was seen throughout the year, with peak activity in March and April. RV/EV was most frequently seen in the autumn and winter months, RSV A/B and HMPV in the winter and spring months, HCoVs in the spring months, AdV in the spring and summer months, and HBoV and PIVs in the summer months. The differences in the peak periods, compared to previous reports, could be explained by the smaller number of cases in our study (particularly for HCoVs, PIVs, and HMPV), regional differences, or annual variability, which has been demonstrated in other studies (13, 20, 25).",

First, we were unable to obtain accurate inpatient or outpatient data of the cases and thus we could not present the distribution of respiratory viruses according to inpatient and outpatient groups. However, most of our contracted healthcare institutions consisted of local outpatient polyclinics in Istanbul, and a high proportion of the samples may have been collected from outpatients and a minority from inpatients. Second, although multiplex real-time PCR assays are reported to have excellent sensitivity and specificity, there is a possibility of false-positive or false-negative results. As mentioned above, it may be difficult to diagnose whether a positive nasopharyngeal swab shows the etiology or evidence of nasopharyngeal colonization. Lastly, one year may be considered too short a time for an epidemiologic study, but we think that our preliminary data could provide useful findings for further investigations.",

In our region, respiratory viruses were generally active in the early spring and winter, and the peak months for these agents were different from each other over a one-year period. Early detection and monitoring of respiratory pathogens is essential in order to avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics, to control the spread of infection, and to contribute to public health surveillance efforts, and the multiplex real-time PCR assay could be a suitable and effective method in this regard.",
