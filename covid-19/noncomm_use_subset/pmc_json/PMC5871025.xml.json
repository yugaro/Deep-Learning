            "text": "Drugs that directly inhibit virus replication have become mainstays in the treatment of chronic viral infections such as HIV/AIDS,1 hepatitis C virus (HCV),2 hepatitis B virus, herpesvirus and acute infections such as influenza. RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV possess ideal targets for virus inhibition such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease. Proteases are a particularly good target because they are involved in virus maturation (HIV) or production of functional viral proteins (HCV). Protease inhibitors are also used in combination with inhibitors of reverse transcription for HIV/AIDS for lifelong therapy, and combinations of different protease inhibitors have been highly effective in curing HCV infection in people.2 Therefore, it is not surprising that viral protease should also be an attractive target for research on RNA virus infections of animals. Kim et al synthesized peptidyl compounds that target 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) and evaluated them for their efficacy against feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline calicivirus, as well as important human RNA viruses that encode 3CLpro or related 3C protease.3\u20136 They identified a series of compounds that showed potent inhibitory activity against various coronaviruses, including FCoV, with a wide margin of safety. The in vivo efficacy of their 3CLpro inhibitors was evaluated in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus A59, a murine coronavirus, and found to cause significant reductions in virus titers and pathologic lesions.5",

This was demonstrated to be the case in a subsequent study using experimental feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) infection in laboratory cats.6 Although experimental FIPV infection is highly fatal once the infection reaches a definable stage, 14\u201320 days of GC376 treatment caused rapid disease remission in six cats that has lasted over 12 months at the time of writing in the remainder.",

Any abnormal signs or behaviors were to be noted and promptly reported. Euthanasia, when required, was conducted either at UC Davis or by the primary-care veterinarian. Bodies of cats euthanized by primary-care veterinarians were immediately refrigerated and sent on ice packs by overnight express mail to UC Davis for necropsy.

A rapid improvement in health was observed in all cats and treatment was stopped. Despite the favorable initial response, disease signs recurred 1 (CT01, CT05), 2 (CT03, CT04) or 7 (CT02) weeks after the 2 week treatments ended (Figure 2). The cats were then retreated, the rationale being to progressively extend primary and secondary treatment periods for as long as their FIP remained responsive to GC376 (see CT04, CT22, Figure 2). New cats that entered the trial were next treated for 3 (CT07) or 4 weeks (CT08, CT16). Cats CT08 and CT16 responded initially, but their disease signs reappeared while on treatment. Cat CT08 developed neurologic disease, whereas cat CT16 had a recurrence of abdominal lesions (Table 1). The primary and secondary treatment periods were then extended to 9 weeks (CT07, CT09, CT10, CT14) (Figure 2). Cat CT09 developed neurologic signs during the 9 week primary treatment and was eventually euthanized when disease signs became severe. Cat CT07 developed neurologic disease 6 weeks after starting the second treatment. At that point, all new cats admitted to the trial, and earlier cats such as CT10, were treated or retreated for at least 12 weeks. The benefit of 12 weeks of treatment was most apparent in cat CT04 that had been treated three other times for shorter periods and then eventually relapsed (Figure 2). Treatment was stopped in cats that had no clinical or laboratory disease signs after 12 weeks of either primary or secondary treatments. It was determined that a minimum treatment period should be around 12 weeks. Cat CT21 was treated for 17 weeks because of delayed improvement in total protein and white blood cell counts (Figure 2). This cat suffered a relapse of pleural FIP 13 weeks later and is at the time of writing receiving more treatment.",

Cats CT15, CT16 and CT17 had 955, 1699 and 2937 times higher levels of viral RNA, respectively, than CT02, which had the lowest virus load in effusion prior to treatment (Figure 7).

The failure of viral RNA levels of CT16 to rapidly decrease, along with severe lymphopenia, may explain why it did not respond to treatment. CT10 also had a somewhat slower drop in virus levels and relapsed twice after antiviral treatment. It is noteworthy that viral RNA levels in ascites cells from cats CT15, CT17 and CT18 decreased the fastest and were also among the five cats that went into a sustained disease remission.

Experimental disease bypasses the critical early stage that starts as kittens with exposure to an innocuous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV).12 Naturally occurring FIP results from specific mutants that arise following FECV infection and FIP occurs in the presence of FECV immunity.13,14 Experimental FIP, in contrast, is induced in coronavirus na\u00efve cats by an intraperitoneal injection of a large dose of laboratory cat-passaged and purified FIPV. Naturally occurring disease is often subclinical for many weeks or months before outward signs of disease are observed, whereas experimental disease signs appear within 2\u20134 weeks and rapidly progresses. Naturally occurring FIP presents in a variety of clinical forms, whereas the experimental infection is almost always effusive and abdominal. FIP in nature is also affected by a milieu of disease enhancing cofactors, while experimental disease occurs in cats that are free of such extraneous influences.15 Differences may explain why a small proportion of cats naturally exposed to FIPVs develop disease, whereas 80\u2013100% of experimentally infected cats die.15,16 Our predictions proved correct and naturally occurring FIP was much more difficult to treat than the experimental disease. It must be stressed, however, that this trial would not have been approved without the information obtained from pharmacokinetic, acute and chronic toxicity, and efficacy studies conducted on laboratory cats.",

Although no specific antiviral drugs are yet available for coronavirus infections in people or animals, antiviral drugs for other viral infections of people, such as HCV and HIV-1, have been developed for treatment and the use of these drugs provided a sound base for their application to animal diseases such as FIP. HCV mainly infects liver cells, causing persistent viral infection in a majority of people. However, only about 20\u201330% of them develop liver diseases in 20\u201330 years. HCV infection can be cleared with non-specific antiviral treatment (interferon and ribavirin) over 6\u201312 months in about half of patients, and recent introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs of 3\u20136 months, duration considerably increased the cure rate to more than 90%.2 HIV infection in people leads to a prolonged asymptomatic state and eventually to advanced HIV disease. HIV-1 infects T cells and macrophges and survives in a latent state. More than 30 antiretroviral drugs, most of them used in combinations of two or more drugs, have been successfully used to reduce viral load to undetectable levels in the blood of HIV/AIDS patients. However, the virus rebounds on discontinuation of antiviral treatment, necessitating life-long antiviral treatment. Dissemination of virus to the brain, which is mainly mediated by virus-infected macrophages, and subsequent development of neurologic disease occurs in more than 50% of HIV infections.17 Therefore, neurologic impairment still remains an important problem even in this antiviral treatment era. These precedents of antiviral treatment of HCV and HIV-1 infections show that treatment outcome (viral clearance vs viral persistence), treatment duration (finite vs continous) and the presence of neurologic sequelae are greatly influenced by viral pathogenesis.",

This result confirms our findings of rapid reversal of clinical signs in laboratory cats with experimental FIP treated with GC376,6 and extended our knowledge of the drug\u2019s effects on a broad spectrum of forms of naturally occurring FIP. Cats came from various parts of the USA and even Peru, thus confirming that geographically diverse field strains of FIPV were equally susceptible to this inhibitor. Marked reductions in viral RNA transcripts occurred in effusions within days of treatment and were associated with rapid improvement of health. However, disease remission was sustained for 3 months and longer in only 7/20 of these cats. Failure to achieve long-term disease remission was ultimately associated with the occurrence of neurologic disease in the absence of gross abdominal lesions or a recurrence/persistence of gross abdominal lesions in the presence of histologic lesions in the brain and/or eyes. These findings indicate that FIPV has a greater propensity to spread from the body cavities to the brain than previously assumed, especially if given enough time. This spread most likely involves infected macrophages that enter the brain through small blood vessels in the meninges and ependyma.18,19",

The most likely explanation for this delay, as well as some therapeutic benefit of higher dosages, was that some GC376 was still able to penetrate into the brain. GC376 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were only 3% of plasma in the brain at 2 h after a subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 10 mg/kg (unpublished data). Although the relative brain drug concentrations in these cats were low, they were still 21.4-fold higher than the levels required to inhibit virus replication in tissue culture. Given this finding, it was assumed that higher dosages would allow more drug into the brain. This assumption was bolstered by experiences with two cats that manifested neurologic signs. Increasing the dosage of GC376 to 50 mg/kg q12h in one cat (CT01) resulted in a noticeable improvement but did not eliminate the signs of brain disease. Extending treatment for a period of almost 3 months at a dosage of 15 mg/kg q12h appeared to delay the progression of neurologic signs in a second cat (CT12), whereas attempts to reduce the total daily dosage in this cat to 10 mg/kg q12h or 15 mg/kg q24h caused neurologic signs to worsen. This suggested that dosages of 15 mg/kg q12h or above allowed enough GC376 to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier to retard but not eliminate neurologic signs.",

            "text": "The high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in this study was greater than previously reported and unexpected given that cats with signs of brain or spinal cord involvement were excluded from the trial.20 CNS disease was much more likely to occur in older cats with dry or dry-to-wet disease than in young cats with wet FIP. This indicates that FIPV can enter the brain in many cats, if given enough time. Infection of the CNS appears to involve peritoneal-type macrophages, as FIPV-infected cells in the brains of cats with neurologic FIP more closely resemble peritoneal rather than resident brain macrophages.18,19 This should not be surprising, as macrophages migrate to various tissues, including the brain, to carry out immune surveillance and are also targets for a range of infectious agents, such as FIPV and HIV-1. Infected macrophages play a major role in viral dissemination to the brain in patients with HIV and detection of virus in the brain can occur within weeks of infection.21,22 However, neurologic impairment usually occurs at a later stage. Anti-HIV drugs also reduce the frequency of severe neurologic impairment,23 as observed with FIPV and GC376 in the present study. There are also alternative explanations. It is possible that extra-CNS involvement may inhibit the development of brain disease and vice versa. It is common to see CNS disease occur in the absence of visceral disease and vice versa.13,20 Suppressing viral replication in the non-neuronal tissues may also enhance positive selection for mutants that are more neurotropic or neurovirulent. However, proof for the latter would require considerable studies using laboratory cats.",

However, viral resistance did not appear to be responsible for relapses of abdominal diseases in five treated cats. These cats had granulomatous-like masses, often in the colon and ileo-cecal-colic lymph nodes, which may have provided a protected place for viruses to persist. Protection of pathogens within granulomas is a well-documented phenomenon for mycobacteria and applies to other pathogens such as viruses.24 The status of liver disease (cirrhosis) in HCV infection also increases the risk of relapse and necessitates longer treatment, indicating that viruses may also be protected from drugs when in certain protected sites.2 The formation of \u2018protective granulomas\u2019 involves a large number of chemokines and cytokines and upregulation of chemokine receptors, addressins, selectins and integrins.25 Persistence of pathogens in such protected sites may require a higher dose of drug and a longer treatment period.",

The seventh cat, CT04, was an extreme to these six younger cats. CT04 was the oldest cat in the study at 6.8 years that presented with substantial weight loss (30%) and disease limited to mesenteric lymph nodes.

The expectation based on experimental studies was that 2 weeks of treatment might be sufficient; hence, that was used as a starting point. However, this study indicated that a minimum treatment period was closer to 12 weeks, which was surprisingly close to the usual 12 week period required to treat humans with HCV using protease inhibitors.2 However, the treatment period for HCV can vary from 8\u201324 weeks in different people. Cat CT21 was outwardly healthy, active and growing after 12 weeks of treatment, but total proteins and white blood cell counts had still not returned to normal as they had in the other six cats. Nonetheless, a decision was made to stop treatment after 17 weeks because of the long period of outwardly normal health. Whether treating for a longer period of time would have prevented a disease relapse 13 weeks after stopping treatment is open to conjecture, but it does raise the point of how long treatment is required in some cats. It also raises the question of how long remission must be sustained to declare the disease cured rather than in a sustained remission. The longest disease-free period has been over 11 months at the time of writing, with five other cats free of infection signs for 5\u20139 months. Based on clinical and histologic evidence of neurologic disease at the time of fatal relapses, it would seem that the virus will eventually reach the brain and that this may be the most important limiting factor in antiviral drug treatment of FIP.",
