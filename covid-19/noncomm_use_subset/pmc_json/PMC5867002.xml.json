Although the diagnosis can be suggested based on clinical features, confirmation by non\u2010invasive imaging techniques is necessary. This report describes a rare case of IJVP in a one year old Warmblood horse. The horse was admitted with a huge, soft intermittent swelling of the right jugular groove, especially when lowering the head. Ultrasound showed an enlarged vein which ended abruptly cranially near the mandibula but which showed normal drainage towards the heart. Cardiac function was normal. Angio CT confirmed the findings and showed secondary distention of the venous system on the right side. Due to an uncertain future sport career and the extent of the venous dilatation, surgical intervention was declined due to the complexity, and the horse was euthanized. On necropsy the right external jugular vein was smaller compared to the left. In addition, a persistent and enormously dilated right internal jugular vein (10 cm diameter), which is normally absent in horses, was present. Based on these necropsy findings, diagnosis of IJVP could be made.",

It is used primarily for cytological evaluation of non\u2010septic conditions, and is especially helpful when severe equine asthma, mild equine asthma or exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) is suspected. Some clinicians have observed by endoscopy that in some horses the sampled bronchus collapses when vacuum is applied to retrieve the BAL fluid, and thereby reducing the amount of recovered fluid. Poor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovery has been observed in horses with moderate to severe inflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate if the administration of a single dose of a bronchodilator in equine patients with a suspicion of severe equine asthma could help in improving recovery of BALF. A total of 15 horses with severe equine asthma were evaluated: 6 horses were once pretreated 30 minutes before BAL with 0.001 mg/kg of inhaled salbutamol, while 9 horses was not treated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with BAL\u2010catheter by instilling 300\u2013350 mL of warm sterile saline, using 60 mL syringes. Amount of recovered fluid was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with a two\u2010tailed Student T\u2010test using Excel. Mean BALF recovery in treated group was 53.9%, while in not\u2010treated group 35.61% (P < 0.05). We can conclude that single pretreatment with salbutamol in horses with severe equine asthma improve the volume of recovered fluid after BAL, therefore clinicians should consider such procedure before performing BAL on horses with suspicion of bronchoconstriction.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ileal impactions and the use of flax shives opposed to straw as bedding. Medical records of 2,337 referral cases evaluated for abdominal pain between January 2008 and May 2017 were reviewed. Diagnosis, date of admission, age, breed, gender, weight, stall bedding and outcome were recorded. The association between bedding and ileal impaction was evaluated by a Chi square test; the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The proportion of cases stabled on flax bedding was 11.4%. The overall prevalence of ileal impactions was 4.2%. In the flax group, the prevalence of ileal impaction was 9.4% as opposed to 3.6% in the straw group. The OR (2.83; 95% CI, 1.83\u20134.40; P < 0.001) indicated that horses stabled on flax bedding were approximately 3 times more likely to have ileal impaction compared to horses stabled on straw. No significant association for date of admission, age, breed, gender and weight was found in a multivariate model. Survival to discharge was 72.5% in the medically treated group compared to 76.7% in the surgically treated group. No significant association was found between survival to discharge and type of bedding. These results suggest that horses housed on flax bedding were more likely to develop ileal impaction compared to horses on straw.",

The aim of our study is to describe changes in QRS morphology in relation to the site of ventricular ectopy. In 4 horses, under general anesthesia, a mapping catheter (Intellamap Orion, Boston Scientific) was used for ventricular pacing at specific locations in the left and right ventricle. The catheter was guided by 3D electro\u2010anatomical mapping (Rhythmia, Boston Scientific) and transthoracic ultrasound. After placement of the catheter in the right and left apical, high septal and high free wall area, supra\u2010threshold ventricular pacing was performed at a pacing cycle length between 800 and 1,000 ms while a modified base\u2010apex ECG (Televet100) was recorded. From this ECG, at sinus rhythm (SR) and at each pacing location, 20 QRS complexes were used for QRS morphology description and measurement of QRS amplitude and duration. Compared to SR, paced QRS complexes had longer duration. A large positive R and small negative s morphology was found at high septal and high right ventricular free wall pacing while apical and high left ventricular free wall pacing resulted in small positive r and large negative S morphology. These preliminary results suggest that typical ECG characteristics from a modified base\u2010apex surface ECG may be helpful to identify the site of ventricular ectopy. These findings might be helpful in future for diagnosis and treatment of complex arrhythmias and development of new treatment strategies.",

The control ponies (n = 6; BCS 4\u20136/9) received 100% of their daily digestible energy needs. Non\u2010invasive blood pressure measurements (oscillometric device on coccygeal artery; Cardell 9402) were taken weekly during the experimental period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of both the control group and test group were recorded to examine the effect of an excessive diet. SBP, DBP and HR were significantly higher in the test group compared to the control group, moreover significant changes in HR and DBP occurred directly after starting the diet (wk 1; wk 0, respectively) and SBP changed after about 10 weeks on the diet. The same experiment was repeated one year later after a 16\u2010week period of only hay before restarting the excessive diet. Groups slightly differed (test n = 5, 2 new; control n = 5, 3 new). Heart rate and blood pressure changes over time showed the same pattern as the year before.",

            "text": "Assessment of insulin dysregulation (ID) is essential to diagnose EMS. However, protocols for implementation of oral diagnostic test vary from glucose administration with the animals' feed to glucose administration via naso\u2010gastric tubing. Manipulation\u2010induced stress response during naso\u2010gastric tubing is a common concern, resulting in missing owner compliance and an uncertainty about impairment of test results. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the impairment of naso\u2010gastric tubing on clinical relevant parameters during oral glucose test (OGT). Eighteen Icelandic horses of varying sex, age, weight and insulin sensitivity were included into the study. OGT was performed with 1 g/kg BW glucose in 2 L water administered via naso\u2010gastric tubing, followed by a Sham\u2010OGT (SOGT) with administration of 2 L water without glucose three weeks later. Blood samples were collected for 2 hours and were analyzed for insulin, glucose, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. OGT caused time\u2010dependent increase in glucose concentration (P < 0.0001) and endogenous insulin response (P < 0.0001), whereas glucose and insulin concentrations remained unaffected during SOGT, differing significantly from OGT (P < 0.0001). ACTH and cortisol increased immediately after naso\u2010gastric tubing, however both were not significant different from baseline concentrations after 120 minutes. To conclude, clinical relevant insulin and glucose concentrations determined between 60 and 120 minutes showed no variation in SOGT, suggesting most likely no impairment by acute stress response due to naso\u2010gastric tubing. Therefore, glucose application during OGT procedure can be performed via naso\u2010gastric tubing without falsifying the relevant test results in terms of ID although an influence on glucose kinetics related to OGT remains unknown.",
