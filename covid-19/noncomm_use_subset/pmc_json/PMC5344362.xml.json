CQI is an approach to the management and improvement of organizational services and processes (Dilley et al. 2012; Nicolucci et al. 2010; Radawski 1999). The approach stands in contrast to quality control and assurance by virtue of its focus on identifying opportunities to improve work processes as opposed to identifying individualized problems and maintaining a status quo (Dever 1997). CQI relies heavily on performance measurement and analysis, as well as on the involvement of leadership and front-line staff in decision-making processes (Kosseff 1992; McLaughlin 1987; Radawski 1999).",

The four dimensions of CQI represent an assessment framework derived from systematic reviews of empirical healthcare research. In addition, Shortell et al.'s earlier research on the cultures of high-performing organizations is used to augment the cultural dimension of the adapted framework (Shortell et al. 1995). For instance, developmental cultures featuring an emphasis on risk-taking, innovation and change, as well as group cultures with strong teamwork and participation, found the greatest success in supporting CQI initiatives. Hierarchical and rational cultures that stress bureaucratic norms and narrow definitions of achievement were found to act as barriers.",

Resource inadequacy was a key barrier in McLees et al.'s (2014) study of 74 public health agencies involved with the National Public Health Improvement Initiative in the US, as it is in the strategic dimension of Shortell et al.'s framework. The importance of training and education in quality-improvement concepts and techniques is also stressed in both the public health literature and the technical dimension (Corso et al. 2010). Knowledge transfer and exchange, supportive organizational cultures and the influence of implementers in decision-making outlined in the structural, cultural and strategic dimensions were factors that did not appear to have extensive profiles in the public health literature.",

            "text": "This study is limited by its small public health unit sample, which, although offers valuable insight into a nascent quality improvement process, ultimately, cannot represent the broader set of units. Also, while boards of health are acknowledged to be important stakeholders in Ontario's public health system, members were not included in this study because of unsuccessful recruitment. Furthermore, this study offers a snapshot of an initiative in a fluid environment and in its very early stages. Changes to the approach are expected, which have potential implications on the perceptions of informants. This also means that evidence of outcomes resulting from the presence of facilitators and barriers was beyond the scope of this study.",

The study also represents one of the first attempts to examine the implementation of a CQI initiative across a complex public health system using an empirically derived and validated framework from the healthcare field. Insight provided by the framework relating to facilitators and barriers of CQI implementation has largely confirmed disparate public health research on the topic (Corso et al. 2010; McLees et al. 2014; Riley et al. 2012; Shortell et al. 1998). This confirmation is a promising indicator that the framework may hold value as a tool for public health decision-makers developing and implementing CQI systems. Finally, future research should test the four-dimensions framework in other public health environments and, more importantly, examine the linkages between the framework's indicated outcomes and attributable facilitators and barriers.",
