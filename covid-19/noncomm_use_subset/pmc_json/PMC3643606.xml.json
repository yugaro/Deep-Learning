            "text": "Organization of the Dengue virus (DENV) genome represents an example of intra-genomic long distance interactions that modulate molecular processes. DENV is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive (+)-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, whose members are responsible for diseases of major health importance, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, dengue fever and a dengue hemorrhagic fever. The DENV genome encodes a single-open reading frame, flanked by highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs) (5\u20137). The secondary structure of DENV UTRs has attracted attention, as they have been shown to encompass motifs involved in regulation of translation, replication, transcription and viral pathogenesis (7\u201310). It has been proposed that the 3\u2032-localized elements, including the terminal stem\u2013loop (3\u2032 SL) together with cyclization sequence (3\u2032 CS), the upstream of AUG region (3\u2032 UAR) and the downstream of AUG region (3\u2032 DAR), are crucial for the initiation of (\u2212) strand, RNA-dependent RNA synthesis (2,5). These motifs are proposed to interact with their complementary elements positioned at the 5\u2032 terminus, the 5\u2032 CS, the 5\u2032 UAR and the 5\u2032 DAR, resulting in long-range RNA\u2013RNA\u2013mediated genome circularization (5,6,11). Following hybridization of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini, the DENV genome has been proposed to endure extensive rearrangements of both UTRs, opening of the 3\u2032 SL to form an extended duplex with the 5\u2032 UAR and formation of a double-stranded region via 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 CS interactions (12). As a result, the viral NS5 polymerase initially docked at the 5\u2032 stem\u2013loop A (SLA) would be relocated to the structurally reorganized 3\u2032 terminus, allowing launch of (\u2212) strand synthesis (6,11). Additional structural motifs of the 3\u2032-UTR have also been shown to modulate DENV molecular processes. Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that the tandem, almost identical dumbbell structures, designated 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 DB, might participate in regulation of RNA synthesis and translation (13\u201315). The leftmost hairpins of both DBs contain a set of identical five nucleotide motifs, referred to as TL1 and TL2 (5\u2032-GCUGU-3\u2032). The top loop (TL) regions have been suggested to pair with complementary motifs (PK2 and PK1, respectively) nested within A-rich sequences flanking both DBs (13,16). The TL1/PK2 and TL2/PK1 interactions would promote formation of two pseudoknots, which have been proposed to modulate both viral replication (15) and translation (8).",

With respect to the structure of 5\u2032 terminal motifs, the majority of data originate from chemical or enzymatic probing of short RNA segments (12), often in the absence of their complementary partners (17). In this study, we have analyzed the interplay of these regions by solving the secondary structure of DENV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal regions in the context of a 719-nt subgenomic minigenome (hereafter referred as \u2018DENV-MINI\u2019) (18). We combined selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) with Pb2+ ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis of DENV-MINI mutant RNAs to examine the previously proposed cis-acting RNA motifs and their potential binding partners, as well as identify long-range tertiary interactions between them. Our findings provide new insights into the secondary and tertiary interactions of DENV-MINI RNA and contribute to the understanding of viral RNA replication.",

Two regions that exhibit high sensitivity to NMIA modifications were located within the 5\u2032 stem\u2013loop A (SLA), A31\u2013U34 and U48\u2013A50, which corresponded to the TL and the side stem\u2013loop (SSL), respectively. Three helical regions of 5\u2032 SLA, U3\u2013G9:C64\u2013G70, C11\u2013G15:A56\u2013G61 and C24\u2013A29:U35\u2013G40, were insensitive to NMIA. The remainder of the reactive nucleotides were situated within the U62\u2013U63 bulge and internal loops G17\u2013A19 and G22\u2013A23. Downstream of SLA, the oligoU tract spanning nt U71\u2013U80 was predicted to be single-stranded. This region was followed by the unreactive double-stranded upstream of AUG region (dsUAR), formed via a long-range interaction between the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs (nt A81\u2013G96 and nt C638\u2013U654). Here, the only reactive residues occupied the vicinity of bulge (C646), mismatch (G84) and the closing base pair of the helix. The internal loop enclosing the first AUG codon (nt A97\u2013A104 and G631\u2013C637) was predicted to be single-stranded followed by the double-stranded 6-nt long downstream of UAR region (DAR) containing reactive residues within the mismatch (A108) and the closing pairs of the helices. The capsid hairpin (cHP, A115\u2013U133) (12), displayed an unreactive stem followed by a 7-nt reactive apical loop. As suggested by previous chemical probing studies, the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 terminal interactions were mediated by base pairing between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 cyclization sequences, which formed 11-nt double-stranded cyclization region (CS) (U134\u2013G144 and C614\u2013A624) (12). Subsequently, two short hairpins that formed downstream of the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS were found within the sequence of the 5\u2032-end of the capsid protein gene. One contains a purine-rich and moderately reactive apical loop (A152\u2013U159) and the other with a reactive 3-nt loop and A\u2013C mismatch (G165\u2013C185). Both hairpins were followed by 5-nt helical region (A190\u2013U194 and A444\u2013U448), which provided additional linkage between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini.",

            "text": "With regard to the 3\u2032-UTR, SHAPE provided information on the 3\u2032 SL structure, obscured only at the extreme 3\u2032 terminus because of the presence of hybridized primer (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1). The 3\u2032 SL displayed NMIA sensitivity at the apical loop (A674\u2013C680) and insensitivity at its leftmost side. The fact that this large 79-nt stem\u2013loop was followed with reactive stretch of 3 nt (C655\u2013U657) and unreactive dsUAR region (nucleotides A81\u2013G96 and nucleotides C638\u2013U654), enforced the proposed conformation. Previous phylogenetic comparative studies suggested that the 3\u2032-UTR enclosed two almost identical DBs that might assume a pseudoknot conformation with their downstream complementary regions (13,16). SHAPE data confirmed the presence of both, and in addition provided detailed insight into their secondary structure. The 3\u2032 DB contained a 6-bp unreactive stem (U536\u2013G541 and C598\u2013A603) and two hairpins on opposing ends (G547\u2013U571 and G584\u2013C597). The apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporated the highly reactive TL2 sequence (G558\u2013U562). The reactivity of TL2, combined with the fact that its downstream complementary partner PK1 (A613\u2013C617) was involved in formation of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS region, would likely prevent the previously suggested TL2/PK1 pseudoknot interaction (13,16). Regarding the 5\u2032 DB, it likewise contained an unreactive stem (G449\u2013G454 and C511\u2013C516) and two hairpins on opposing ends (C462\u2013G482 and G497\u2013C510). Here, however, the apical loop of the leftmost hairpin incorporating the TL1 sequence (G467\u2013G477), although predicted to be single-stranded, harbored mainly unreactive nucleotides. The fact that its complementary partner PK2 was likewise unreactive and enclosed within single-stranded loop (G526\u2013C530) was strongly suggestive of a TL1/PK2 base pairing interaction (Figure 2) (13,16). In addition, both DBs comprised reactive bulges (A491\u2013C496 and A578\u2013A583) and moderately NMIA-sensitive purine-rich internal loops. One of the internal loops of the 3\u2032 DB (G572\u2013A575) was insensitive to modification as it contained a -GGAA- motif. Such -GNRA- tetraloops represent a unique fold, which include a trans sugar edge/Hoogsteen edge G\u2219A pair between the first and the last residues, a hydrogen bond between the 2\u2032-OH of G and the N7 of A and 3\u2032 stacking of all tetraloop bases except the G. This architecture would account for lack of reactivity towards NMIA (31).\n",

Our probing analysis indicated its propensity to form long single-stranded stretches (A274\u2013A291, U364\u2013A376, G418\u2013C424 and U439\u2013A443). One of the loops (U439\u2013A443), composed almost exclusively of adenine residues, was mainly NMIA unreactive. It was shown previously that consecutive adenine bases in single-stranded regions are often involved in stacking interactions, which would account for their inaccessibility towards NMIA modification (34,35). The 3\u2032-UTR region also contained two stable tetraloops (C352\u2013G363 and C425\u2013G438). As expected, the -GNRA- tetraloop (C425\u2013G438), restricted by extensive stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, was NMIA-insensitive (31). On the other hand, the -CAAG- tetraloop (C352\u2013G363) behaved differently. Here, only its GC residues showed little reactivity, which could be interpreted as formation of an intraloop G\u2219C base pair, whereas its AA residues were reactive. The apical loops of two other hairpins (G377\u2013C392 and G396\u2013C412) showed strong NMIA reactivity. Also, an extended hairpin containing internal asymmetric loop (A296\u2013U301 and U345\u2013G346), a bulge (C307\u2013A313) and A-rich, moderately reactive apical loop (A323\u2013A331) was predicted to form between nucleotides G292\u2013C350. Another long hairpin (U206\u2013A267) with a reactive apical loop (A233\u2013A241) and two reactive internal loops (G218\u2013A222 and C252\u2013A256; A227\u2013A229 and G245\u2013A247) enclosed a linker sequence that stretched from A227\u2013G268.",

In addition, positioning of the hybridized 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 termini and the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot on opposite termini of the DENV-MINI RNA is consistent with the two domains playing independent structural/regulatory roles in DENV replication. TL2 of the 3\u2032 DB is likewise spatially separated from other structural motifs, suggesting a functional role for TL2 that does not involve interactions with other RNA elements in the context. The 3\u2032 DB itself is linked to adjacent segments of the DENV-MINI RNA by relatively long, presumably flexible segments of single-stranded RNA. It is conceivable that a second TL2/PK1 pseudoknot could be formed by rotation of the 3\u2032 DB motif, thereby bringing TL2 into proximity with PK1. However, such a rearrangement would also require partial dissolution of the hybridized 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 termini. It is important to note, however, that there is no evidence that base pairing between TL2 and PK1 occurs in the DENV-MINI RNA in vitro.

Our combined SHAPE, aiSHAPE and Pb2+-induced cleavage analysis of the DENV-MINI RNA establish the existence of multiple motifs required for initiation of (\u2212) strand RNA synthesis (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1). The presence of the 5\u2032 SLA, demonstrated crucial for initial binding of RdRp (6,17), the single-stranded polyU tract providing the flexibility to the 5\u2032-UTR (17), together with the rearrangements occurring within 3\u2032 SL (17,30), established replication competency of DENV-MINI RNA (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1). Our results have experimentally verified long-range interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal regions, which involved hybridization between (i) 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS, previously demonstrated to initiate the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 long range RNA\u2013RNA hybridization (5,15), (ii) the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 UAR, required for the correct orientation of the SLA with respect to the 3\u2032 end (30) and (iii) 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 DAR, extending the CS-initiated 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 interaction (11). We have predicted additional regulatory motifs that might contribute to the overall functionality of DENV-MINI RNA. Probing analysis identified tandem DBs spaced by A-rich single-stranded regions in the 3\u2032-UTR, as well as internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA/GNRA-like motifs within the VR domain (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1). These elements may represent candidate assembly sites for proteins, as previous studies identified several host factors that not only bind to DENV UTRs but also actively participate in regulation of replication and translation efficiency (41\u201344). In addition, -GNRA- tetraloops could act as \u2018anchors\u2019 by interacting in a sequence-specific manner with motifs at distant locations along the molecule to enhance RNA self-folding (45,46).",

These authors suggested that the single-base pair difference (A\u2013G), distinguishing PK2 and PK1, conserved in all DENV strains, must have a functional reason to differentiate between both motifs (13).

Also, both sequences were resistant to the complementary strategy of Pb2+-induced hydrolysis, supporting their potential base pairing interactions (Figure 1B insert and Supplementary Figure S2). aiSHAPE lends further credence to TL1/PK2 tertiary interactions (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3), as outcompeting one base pairing partner increased reactivity of the other and vice versa. Moreover, SHAPE analysis of the PK2Flip mutant indicated a major increase in NMIA reactivity of TL1 and PK2 nucleotides, validating disruption of the TL1/PK2 base pairing interaction (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). Consequently, we propose that in the context of DENV-MINI RNA, the TL1 loop of the 5\u2032 DB is involved in hairpin-type (H-type) pseudoknot interactions with the downstream PK2 region (Figure 2) (47). This pseudoknot was predicted to have two helical regions, including base paring between PK2 (G526\u2013C530) and TL1 residues (G470\u2013U474), as well as the stem of the leftmost hairpin (C462\u2013G466 and C478\u2013G482), and three single-stranded loops: A468\u2013G470, U474\u2013C476 and C516\u2013C525 (Figure 2B).",

As noted in Figure 7, the hybridized 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 termini and the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot are located on opposite ends of the DENV-MINI RNA, suggesting an independent structural/regulatory character. Also, the fact that hybridization of LNA/DNA chimeras to either TL1 or PK2 failed to induce extensive structural changes within the interacting 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 termini (Supplementary Figure S3) suggests the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot might indeed function as an autonomous element. In addition, TL2 of the 3\u2032 DB is spatially separated from other structural domains and linked to adjacent segments of the DENV-MINI RNA by relatively long single-stranded regions. It is possible that a second TL2/PK1 pseudoknot could be formed by rotation of the 3\u2032 DB, thereby bringing TL2 into proximity with PK1. However, such a rearrangement would also entail partial dissolution of the hybridized 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 termini and perhaps even the TL1/PK2 interaction, such as might occur in the presence of viral proteins and/or host factors, or in the event the 5\u2032 terminal portion of the genome has been removed by ribonucleases (10) or is sequestered during translation. A similar hypothesis was proposed based on MPGAfold-directed secondary structure prediction of DENV MINI RNA, which indicated differences in the folding behavior of the two DBs (8). In the lack of the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 communication, it was proposed that TL2 could be available to bind PK1 in the 3\u2032 DB to form the putative TL2/PK1 pseudoknot (8).",

It has been shown that \u2018flipping\u2019 of PK2 in the context of luciferase-based DENV2 replicon did not affect translation, but disrupted replication (8), from which we conclude that the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot participates in regulation of DENV RNA synthesis. It is also possible that the TL1/PK2 pseudoknot might create a critical recognition element for host proteins. Supporting this notion, pseudoknots have been shown to cause distortion of A-form helices, creating a bend in the complex to provide a recognition site for ligands (56). Also, it was shown that DEAD-box RNA helicase (DDX6) binds to both DBs and their corresponding PKs regions (43). These authors suggested that the putative pseudoknots might provide assembly sites for DDX6, and that proper assembly of this protein had functional consequences for DENV replication.",

            "text": "SHAPE-directed prediction of RNA folding indicated similar structure rearrangements for the TL2FlipPK1Flip mutant RNA (Supplementary Figures S10\u2013S12), suggesting PK1 is mostly responsible for correct long-range communication between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal regions. Even the presence of compensatory mutations within 5\u2032 CS (TL2FlipPK1Flip-3 mutant) to restore base pairing with PK1 (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures S13\u2013S15) did not entirely reinstate the secondary structure of DENV-MINI RNA. Previous studies using DENV-MINI RNA as templates in in vitro RdRp assays have shown that replication of PK1Flip, TL2FlipPK1Flip mutants was significantly affected, supporting the importance of the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS interaction for RNA synthesis (8). However, the introduction of compensatory mutations at the 5\u2032 CS in DENV-MINI TL2FlipPK1Flip-3 mutant restored replication to nearly wild-type level. This was in contrast to the effects of the PK1 \u2018flipping\u2019 mutations on replication of luciferase-based DENV2 in BHK-21 cells, which showed essentially no replication (8). Related studies using luciferase containing Dengue virus (15), Kunjin virus (57) and West Nile virus replicons (58) carrying point mutations at the 3\u2032 CS are consistent with our observations. In all cases, the altered sequence of 3\u2032 CS attenuated replication, even when mutations were compensated at the 5\u2032 CS. Also, a mutation introduced into the 3\u2032 CS extending the region of complementarity between 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS by one nucleotide was shown to negatively affect replication kinetics of the subgenomic DENV reporter replicon (59). Apparently, not only the secondary structure of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS region but also its sequence composition governs the efficiency of RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "In addition, the TL2FlipPK1Flip mutant (Supplementary Figure S10) provided insight into the second, previously proposed TL2/PK1 pseudoknot (13,16). It was suggested previously that PK1 could modulate DENV genome cyclization via either a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS interaction or by base pairing with TL2 (13,25). Also, studies showed that the long-distance 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS complementarity interferes with efficient translation of DENV2 luciferase (LUC) reporter system in Vero cells (25). It was suggested that the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS interaction may play role in regulating the transition from the translation to the replication phase of the infection. Thus, we expected that release of PK1 from 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS together with the conserved complementarity between both partners, would support formation of TL2/PK1 pseudoknot. SHAPE analysis, however, indicated no reactivity change within \u2018flipped\u2019 TL2 and PK1 (Supplementary Figures S10 and S11). As the addition of \u2018flipping\u2019 mutations within TL2 did not cause any further structural rearrangements compared with PK1Flip mutant (compare Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures S7 and S8), this would dismiss the involvement of TL2 in tertiary interactions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo a TL2/PK1 interaction could be stabilized by participation of host or viral factors for the purpose of other molecular processes, i.e. translation, before the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 CS interaction. Indeed, it has been proposed that the viral NS3 helicase can modulate the folding of cis-acting RNA elements via dual RNA unwinding/annealing activities, providing the switch between alternative conformations of the DENV genome (38,60).",
