Currently available statins include lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin. Statins have a low frequency of side effects including hepatotoxicity, myotoxicity, and proteinuria23. However, adverse reactions involving the respiratory system are uncommon. Several cases of statin-induced pulmonary toxicity have been reported456. Regarding statins, most cases were associated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin. Interstitial lung disease secondary to rosuvastatin is rare78. In addition, rosuvastatin-induced interstitial lung disease has not been reported in Korea. Herein, we will present a patient who was diagnosed with drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) secondary to rosuvastatin.",

He had been diagnosed with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis 18 months previously and was treated with a steroid therapy for 6 weeks. Cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis had been confirmed as being fungus derived from old wallpapers at the time. After the cause removed, it had not recurred over 2 years. He had also been administered metformin 500 mg daily for 16 months for diabetes mellitus. For a transient ischemic attack secondary to vertebral artery stenosis, he was hospitalized and started on acetyl-L-carnitine, cilostazol, and rosuvastatin according to the following schedule: acetyl-L-carnitine, 500 mg, once daily for 48 days prior to this hospitalization; cilostazol, 100 mg, twice daily; and rosuvastatin, 5 mg, once daily for 27 days prior to this hospitalization. While continuing those medications, he developed a fever and cough 3 days prior to this hospital visit. Although he was prescribed an antibiotic (Augmentin) for 3 days at a local clinic, his dyspnea, cough, and fever gradually increased. He was referred to our hospital for proper evaluation and management. He had no known drug allergies.",

On physical examination, a coarse breath sound with fine crackles but without wheezing was heard upon auscultation of both lungs. The patient's laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; white blood cell count, 8,770 cells/\u00b5L (neutrophils, 62.6%; lymphocytes, 26.0%; monocytes, 7.2%; eosinophils, 3.9%; and basophils, 0.3%); and platelet count, 391,000 cells/\u00b5L. The patient's serum biochemistry test results revealed the following: aspartate aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 311 IU/L; total protein, 7.6 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 26.0 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.84 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 106 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 1.06 mg/dL; and LDL cholesterol, 56 mg/dL. His coagulation profile was within normal limits. A urinalysis with microscopy was clear. An arterial blood gas analysis of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was conducted with the patient breathing room air and revealed the following: pH, 7.46; partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), 54.6 mm Hg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), 37.4 mm Hg; bicarbonate (HCO3-), 26.0 mEq/L; and saturation level of oxygen (SaO2), 85.9%. A chest radiograph showed a subtle, diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lower lung fields and subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe. A chest computed tomography scan revealed diffuse ill-defined ground-glass opacities with septal line thickening bilaterally, combined with several subpleural ground-glass opacity nodules (Figure 1). A pulmonary function test revealed the following: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, 102; FEV1, 2.8 L (94%); FVC, 3.47 L (92%); and diffuse capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 57%. Based on his past medical history, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of DILD was suspected. Consequently, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. There were no endobronchial lesions revealed with bronchoscopy. The BAL fluid results were as follows: white blood cell count, 480 cells/\u00b5L (neutrophils, 9%; lymphocytes, 30%; macrophages, 57%; eosinophils, 4%; and basophils, 0%); and red blood cell count, 30 cells/\u00b5L. Microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction of the bronchoscopic wash specimens were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumococcus and respiratory virus. The real-time polymerase chain reaction of bronchial washing specimens was performed as following: Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella, Bordetella, Haemophilus pneumonia, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, bocavirus, metapneumovirus. The results were all negative. Additionally, the urine antigen and immunologic study were performed to exclude others pathogen. The results revealed the following: streptococcal pneumonia and Legionella urinary antigen, negative; Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG/IgM, negative; and Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG (17.65, positive; normal range, <9 index), IgM (4.62, negative; normal range, <9 index). According to the cytology, the majority of the alveolar macrophages had a foamy appearance (Figure 2). To make a differential diagnosis of connective disease or allergic disease, immunologic studies and multiple allergosorbent test system (MAST) were performed as follow: all allergens of MAST, class 0 (0.00-0.34 IU/mL); rheumatoid factor, negative; C3 complement, 135.00 mg/dL (normal range, 90-180 mg/dL); C4 complement, 42.20 mg/dL (normal range, 10-40 mg/dL); anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, negative.",

The prednisolone dose was gradually tapered over 2 weeks.
