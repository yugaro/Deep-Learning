So traditional medicine is still the mainstay of health care and most drugs come from plants. Although many plants have long been recognized and widely used in Nepalese traditional medicine, some are relatively unexplored and not arrived to mainstream medicine (1). Therefore, the search on new drugs must be continued and natural products from plants, microorganisms, fungi and animals can be the source of innovative and powerful therapeutic agents for newer, safer and affordable medicines (2,3). On the other hand the screening of plants as a possible source of antiviral drugs has led to the discovery of potent inhibitors of in vitro viral growth (4\u201311).",

Polyphenols, especially high polymeric procyanidines possess strong anti-influenza viral activity (17), which is in agreement with our previous study (18). In our previous study (19), methanol\u2013water extract of Bergenia ligulata, which is taxonomically closely related to B. ciliata, inhibited the growth of influenza virus A in cell culture with IC50 of 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121. The extract also inhibited the viral protein and nucleic acid synthesis (18). In the present study, the methanol extract of B. ciliata inhibited the influenza virus A and HSV-1 indicating that the genus Bergenia could be the source of potent antiviral drugs. Again potent activity of A. rivularis against both viruses indicated the high prospect of finding antiviral drugs in Saxifragaceae family.",
