In a study of PCT levels in adult patients in various inflammatory states, PCT levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients with bacterial or fungal infections, but normal or slightly elevated in those with several inflammatory diseases3). Furthermore, in a study of PCT levels in pediatric patients, PCT was found to be a significant biomarker for diagnosing pediatric urinary tract infection and neonatal sepsis, and for identifying patients without serious bacterial infections in order to prevent antimicrobial overuse in the pediatric intensive care unit456).",

The present study also showed similar results: (1) The mean PCT level in patients with KD and in those with bacterial infection was significantly higher than that in patients with viral infection. (2) The mean PCT level in patients with KD was lower than that in patients with bacterial infection; however, this difference was not significant. We speculated that immune responses to bacterial infections may occur in patients with KD, although the causative microorganism of KD has not yet been confirmed. The definite cause of KD is currently unknown; however, it is generally accepted that KD develops as a result of a genetic predisposition combined with an infection with an undefined trigger or an autoimmune mechanism. Many bacterial and viral agents have been suggested but not confirmed as triggers of KD infection. Recently, bacterial toxins or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies associated with viral infections have been newly hypothesized as causes for the development of KD18).",

Another study investigating responders and nonresponders to initial IVIG treatment demonstrated that PCT levels were significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders10). This result was similar to the findings of our study. A recent study enrolled 77 patients with complete KD and 24 patients with incomplete KD, and showed that the PCT levels of patients with complete KD were significantly higher than those of patients with incomplete KD11). The authors described that nonresponders to initial IVIG more frequently had complete KD than incomplete KD (16% vs. 4%).

Although PCT levels were not useful in differentiating between KD and bacterial infections, ESR and CPR levels were significantly higher in patients with KD than in those with bacterial infection.
