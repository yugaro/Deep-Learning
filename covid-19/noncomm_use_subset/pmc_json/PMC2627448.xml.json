Two patients were less than 15 years old, 20 patients were 18 to 49 years old, three patients were 50 to 59 years old, and three patients were older than 60 years. All subjects experienced fevers exceeding 38\u2103 (100.4\u00b0F) and fulfilled the WHO criteria for probable SARS (9). All 28 patients were subsequently shown to have significant seroconversion of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody indicating arecent infection by the coronavirus. In addition to having a respiratory illness of unknown cause, during the 10 days prior to onset of symptoms, 12 patients had either lived in an area in which community transmission of SARS was documented, eight patients had traveled to such an area, and eight patients had come into close contact with a person known to have SARS. The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study, and informed consent was not required from the patients.",

The studies were obtained using either conventional radiography (274 examinations, AMX-4, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) or computed radiography (187 studies, Fuji Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) with images archived through a picture archiving and communications system (PACS, Centricity Workstation, version 1.0, General Electric Medical Systems). Hard-copy images from both the conventional and computed radiographies were viewed for all reports. The settings for portable radiography were 72-80 kVp at 1.25-1.5 mAs. The number of radiographs obtained for each patient ranged from 4 to 50 (mean \u00b1 SD = 17.18 \u00b1 9.84). The hospitalized days ranged from 11 to 29 with a mean of 18.17 days; thus, an average of approximately one radiograph was obtained each day for each patient, particularly during the critical period. The frequency of radiography decreased as patient symptoms abated.",

The radiographic findings were recorded without the knowledge of the clinical data but with the knowledge that the patients were victims of suspicious or probable cases of SARS. Any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. On each radiograph, each lung was divided into upper, middle and lower lung zones transversely, with each zone spanning one-third of the craniocaudal length of the lung. The severity of the SARS-related lesions within each lung zone was evaluated by scoring the radiographs with a four-point scale based on visual assessment, as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = up to one-third of lung zone involved, 2 = between one-third and two-thirds of lung zone involved, and 3 = more than two-thirds of lung zone involved. The scores for all 6 zones on each radiograph were added to provide a cumulative score that had a range from zero to 18 (Figs. 1, 2). In addition, data collected from all available chest radiographs included the following: whether the SARS-related lesions were unilateral or bilateral; were associated with radiographically identifiable pleural effusion (defined as increased pleural density with obscuration of the costophrenic sinuses and the hemidiaphragm with meniscus-shaped or horizontal upper border); mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (defined as widening or increased opacity of the mediastinum and pulmonary hila); cavitary lung lesions. The mean radiographic score for each patient during hospitalization was obtained by summation of the radiographic score on each radiograph divided by the total number of radiograph obtained. The maximal radiographic score for each patient represented the worst condition of lung opacities during the clinical course.",

Three of 28 patients expired due to SARS: these included two women without comorbidity, aged 47 and 72 years, and one 41-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus. The onset of illness was based on the clinical manifestation of fever or body temperature above 38\u2103.",

In patients with SARS, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 50 years was 13 times higher than for patients younger than 50 years (17).

Hypoxemia occurred in 60% of our cases (mean 52.53/mmHg \u00b1 13.42) that was most severe on average on day 19 (17). However, the mean and maximal radiographic scores in this series were significantly correlated with the severity of retained arterial CO2, and the maximal radiographic scores also correlated with the degree of hypoxemia. Retained CO2 reflects the severity of lung dysfunction when there is increase of intrapulmonary shunt; this occurred in 71% of our patients (mean 64.93/mmHg \u00b1 28.73) that was most obvious on day 24. The relationship between the severity of lung change and blood gas found in this series is consistent with previous reports describing an inverse relationship between radiographic scores and the percentage of oxygen saturation, particularly at the time of maximal disease (29, 30). The maximal percentages of the involved lung in the mortality and survival groups were significantly different (41.5% \u00b1 8.6 vs 16.4% \u00b1 10.0, p < 0.001) (38).",
