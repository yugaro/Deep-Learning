Both viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality in numerous mammalian species, including humans. HeV first appeared in 1994 in Australia (1), while NiV emerged in Southeast Asia in 1998 (2), where it continues to cause regular outbreaks with very high mortality rates, between 50 and 100% (3). The natural hosts for both viruses are fruit bats (Pteropidae family), with a wide distribution in Australia, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. Potential new virus spillovers thus present a constant risk for future outbreaks (3). The endotheliotropism of these henipaviruses is responsible for systemic infections with generalized vasculitis and may be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome and encephalitis (3). Both viruses are classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogens and present important biosecurity threats (4). There is currently neither a vaccine nor approved treatment against human henipavirus infection.",

NiV has been found to use another unknown attachment receptor to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host and trans-infection of permissive target cells (8). This attachment molecule was sensitive to proteolytic degradation, and virus internalization was not required for cell-mediated trans-infection. As proteoglycans are used by several viruses for binding to target cells (9, 10), we investigated their potential role as a henipavirus attachment receptor.",

HS has the ability to bind to a vast repertoire of proteins and is involved in many physiological as well as pathological processes (11). In addition, the long carbohydrate chains of HS provide easily accessible binding sites for a wide range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (11, 12). Commercial heparin (HP), which is widely used for its anticoagulant properties, is a GAG that is chemically related to HS (13, 14) and displays protein-binding properties similar to HS.",

The treatment of CHO-K1 cells with heparinase 3 inhibited their trans-infection properties by >90%. Accordingly, CHO-derived cell lines that lacked expression of HS because of their deficiency in GAG biosynthesis enzymes (15) were also highly deficient in their ability to mediate trans-infection of NiV (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the NiV-GAG interaction, we compared the ability of virus particles pseudotyped with NiV G and F glycoproteins or vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) (8) to bind surfaces coated with the HS analog heparin by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The strong hyperbolic association shape observed during the injection phase of the sensorgram for NiV, but not for VSV pseudoparticules, clearly indicated a much stronger binding affinity of NiV-pseudotyped viral particles (Fig. 1C), underlining the importance of NiV glycoproteins in the analyzed interaction. To assess the specificity of the NiV-GAG interaction toward HS, by using SPR we compared the binding of NiV-pseudotyped virus to surfaces displaying HS, HP, or dermatan sulfate (DS), another sulfated GAG (Fig. 1D). Although NiV-pseudotyped virus efficiently bound to HP and HS, we did not detect any interaction with the DS surface, suggesting an implication of specific carbohydrate features. Altogether, these results suggested that NiV could specifically use HS as an attachment receptor to promote efficient trans-infection.",

Heparin reduced the trans-infection property of PBLs and CHO-K1 cells by 80% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, heparin was also active when applied after contact with the virus, and both pretreatment and posttreatment with heparin were effective in inhibiting human PBL-mediated trans-infection of either NiV or HeV (Fig. 2B). This inhibition reflects the known capacity of heparin to bind multiple cell surface proteins due to its high negative charge (14). Furthermore, in a pretreatment regimen, heparin also prevented the binding of NiV to CHO-K1 cells by 99%, as measured by cell-associated viral RNA, while the residual binding to the HS-defective pgsA-745 CHO cell line remained unaffected (Fig. 2C). These results indicated the ability of heparin to elute viral particles from cell surface HS by competition.",

Notably, other GAGs found on cell surface proteoglycans, such as chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A), CS-C, and DS, were devoid of inhibition properties (Fig. 2E), revealing the specificity of the inhibition of NiV binding to HS by heparin. Finally, to determine which of two NiV membrane glycoproteins, F or G, was responsible for binding to heparin, we analyzed HP binding of pseudotyped NiV expressing either NiV-F or -G by SPR (Fig. 2F). Significantly more binding was obtained with NiV-G than with NiV-F (Fig. 2F), and results were further confirmed using HeLa cells transfected with either NiV-G or -F (data not shown). We concluded from these results that NiV trans-infection requires binding to cell surface HS via NiV-G, a process that can be inhibited by competition with heparin.",

This resulted in a modest but significant reduction in the number of infected cells at 3 days postinfection (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the inhibition of HS sulfation in Vero cells after treatment with sodium chlorate significantly reduced infection with both NiV (Fig. 3B) and HeV (Fig. 3C), the latter being much more sensitive to sodium chlorate pretreatment than the former.

Heparin pretreatment of Vero cells reproducibly reduced the number of cells infected by either NiV or HeV (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, pretreatment of either the cells or the virus was efficient, even with very low concentrations (5 \u00b5g/ml) (Fig. 4B). To distinguish the contribution of heparin-mediated inhibition of NiV-G binding to cell surface HS from binding to an EFN-B2/3 entry receptor, HS-negative CHO-pgsA-745 cells stably expressing either EFN-B2 or -B3 (7) were pretreated with 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of heparin and infected with NiV (Fig. 4C). Heparin treatment modestly, but significantly, reduced the percentage of infected cells from both cell lines, indicating that this molecule may also directly inhibit or delay the binding of NiV to its entry receptors EFN-B2 and -B3. This effect may be the consequence of direct heparin binding to EFN-B2 and/or -B3, as recently suggested (17). Indeed, SPR analysis suggested that both CHO-pgsA-745\u2013EFN-B2 and -B3 cells bound to heparin, in contrast to nontransfected CHO-pgsA-745 cells (Fig. 4D), and proportionally to the level of expressed EFN-B2 and -B3 transcripts (Fig. 4E). Accordingly, soluble recombinant EFN-B3 bound to heparin in the SPR assay as well (Fig. 4F), fitting a 1:1 Langmuir binding model and yielding a Kd of 16 \u00b1 6 nM (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) for the interaction. Additional SPR analysis showed interactions of EFN-B3 with both HS and heparin, but not with CS (data not shown). Thus, by its ability to compete with HS for binding to NiV-G and to interfere with EFN-B2/B3 receptors, heparin can restrict both trans- and cis-infection by henipavirus.",

Since PO-heparin inhibited lymphocyte-mediated NiV trans-infection in vitro similarly to heparin (Fig. 5A), we tested its antiviral properties in the golden hamster model of NiV infection, which closely reproduces the NiV pathogenesis seen in humans (20). While all nontreated animals succumbed to infection in less than 6 days, survival in the PO-heparin-treated group increased moderately (P = 0.017) (Fig. 5B), thus suggesting a biological relevance for NiV-HS interaction and revealing potential antiviral properties of heparin-like molecules in vivo.",

In contrast to human lymphocytes, specific subsets of porcine lymphocytes could be infected with NiV and thus participate in the transmission of the virus in the swine host, also in cis (21). Low levels of viral replication were detected in human dendritic cells, suggesting that this cell population could contribute to transmission of NiV both in cis and in trans (8). Recently, a CD169-dependent trans-infection pathway in dendritic cells was demonstrated for henipaviruses (22); however, the molecular mechanism of NiV trans-infection mediated by lymphocytes, which do not express CD169, has remained obscure.",

HS has been shown to bind many different viruses by interacting with either one or more viral glycoproteins. Interactions between HS and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 (23, 24) and with vaccinia virus A27L protein (25) have been demonstrated. Furthermore, HS can bind measles virus hemagglutinin (H) (26) and the fusion (F) proteins of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (27) and human metapneumovirus (28). In the cases of bovine RSV and canine distemper virus, both H and F seem to interact with HS (29, 30). Our results suggest that NiV-G interacts with HS. Although VSV-G protein has been shown to interact with HS (31), our SPR analysis indicated that binding of NiV-G to HS had a higher affinity. Further studies using recombinant soluble viral G protein should give better insights into the biochemical characteristics of this interaction and identify binding sites on both ligands. HS has been previously suggested to capture, protect, and transmit HIV-1 (9) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) (10) in trans. Similarly to what was shown for HIV-1 (23), the other sulfated GAGs, such as CS or DS, were inactive, implying that structural features beyond charge density on the polysaccharide backbone could be important for the activity. The implication is that different HS-binding sites may be involved, as shown recently for papillomavirus, for which sequential engagement of three different HS-binding sites leads to virus attachment, interaction with the receptor, and entry into the cell (32). Likewise, HS stabilizes varicella-zoster virus, making it more accessible for binding to its entry receptor (33). Thus, similar to its role in other viral infections, HS could improve the contact of henipavirus with host cells so as to help the virus reach the cellular receptors EFN-B2 and -B3 (summarized schematically in Fig. 6).",

Owing to its capacity to bind multiple cell surface proteins via negatively charged sulfated groups (14), heparin could prevent henipavirus attachment to cell surface HS. As it is more sulfated than HS, it could also bind viruses with higher affinity than HS and thus act as an efficient competitive inhibitor for virus binding. Furthermore, heparin significantly reduces direct virus infection in cis, in addition to affecting infection in trans. This effect may also result from the interaction between heparin and henipavirus receptors, as evidenced by SPR for EFN-B3 and in agreement with a recent report (17). These results allowed us to propose a model for the role of HS in henipavirus binding and entry and possible interference of heparin with viral infection (Fig. 6). In addition to the inhibition of henipavirus infection by binding to either viral G glycoprotein or viral entry receptors, heparin may significantly limit virus spread within the organism by blocking binding to the attachment receptor HS and consecutive trans-infection of permissive cells.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which a heparin molecule devoid of anticoagulation properties (13) restrains virus infectivity in vivo most likely depends on the combination of its different biological activities. In addition to affecting henipavirus infection in cis and in trans, heparin could constrain inflammation and consequent tissue damage by binding various inflammatory molecules. Indeed, both heparin and HS bind to important immunoregulatory molecules, such as the chemokine CXCL10 (34), which is strongly upregulated during NiV infection (35). Moreover, as heparin is a heavily sulfated electronegative molecule, it might enhance the antiadhesive properties of the endothelium against leukocytes (36). This effect may rely on the ability of heparin to bind directly to several adhesion molecules that are expressed during inflammation, including L-selectin (37), CD11b/MAC1 (38), and P-selectin (39). Finally, heparin-like derivatives can stabilize the endothelium (40) and help in blocking the passage of both humoral and cellular immune factors, as well as viruses, through the blood-brain barrier (14, 41). This process may also contribute to the antiviral effect observed during in vivo experiments, together providing a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for further development of this antiviral approach.",

Indeed, heparin treatment reduces NiV infection in a hamster animal model, thus opening interesting therapeutic perspectives to complement treatment of this highly lethal infection. Additionally, the acute nature of henipavirus infection makes it more prone to the regulatory action of heparin, compared to some chronic infections, including HIV or HTLV, where heparin showed in vitro antiviral activity (9, 10). The HS mimetic PI-88 has already been shown to have significant beneficial effect in vivo in the outcome of dengue virus and encephalitic flavivirus infections (42). The use of derivatives that mimic the heparin/HS structure (43), synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptides that bind HS moieties on cell surfaces (44), or polyanionic compounds with longer half-lives in vivo (40), devoid of anticoagulant activity and with potentially higher affinity to henipavirus G-protein, may further improve therapeutic effects.",

HS (Celsus, Cincinnati, OH, United States), HP (Sigma), and DS (Sigma) were biotinylated and immobilized on Biacore sensor chips, as described before (49). Briefly, two flow cells were activated with a mix of 0.2 M N-ethyl-N\u2032-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Then, streptavidin (50 \u00b5g/ml in 10 mM acetate buffer [pH 4.5]) was injected over the activated flow cells, to obtain an immobilization level of ~2,500 response units (RU). One of these flow cells served as a negative control, while biotinylated HP, HS, and DS were injected on the other flow cells, to obtain suitable immobilization levels (50 to 70 RU for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc and pseudotyped viral particles analysis; 200 RU for cells). Interaction assays were performed at a flow rate of 5 \u00b5l/min and involved 5- to 10-min injections of sample over the HP and negative-control surfaces, followed by a 5-min washing step with HBS-P buffer to allow dissociation of the complexes formed. At the end of each cycle, GAG surfaces were regenerated by sequential injections of 0.05% SDS (1 min) and 2 M NaCl (2.5 min). Typical sample concentrations used were 10 \u00b5g/ml for recombinant human ephrin-B3 Fc (R&D Systems), 1 \u00d7 107 to 2.4 \u00d7 107 particles/ml for pseudotyped viral particles and 0.5 \u00d7 106 to 0.7 \u00d7 106 cells/ml for CHO-pgsA-745 and HeLa cell transfectants. The sensorgrams shown correspond to on-line subtraction of the negative-control signal from the GAG surface signal.
