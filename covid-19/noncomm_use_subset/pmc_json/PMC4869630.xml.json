This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent.1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.",

Our analysis is based on a reflection of the social\u2013ecological model widely used in health behavior research and practice to assess the multiple levels that influence a health issue. More specifically, this model is unique because it allows the researcher or practitioner to identify the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors that contribute to a particular health issue or event so that health professionals and/or researchers may identify the best intervention or research methods. Therefore, we will detail the ethical issues that impact the Ebola epidemic from a social\u2013ecological model analysis.",

Only three infections occurred outside West Africa (two in the US and one in Spain). At the time of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths. This was contained, and the country has remained EVD free since November 2014. The West African region had been on the brink of being declared EVD-free several times but for instances of new case identification in Sierra Leone4 and Liberia.5 The region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016.6 There are, however, potentials for multiple flare-ups in the region as some survivors could sexually transmit infection.7,8",

First, it is the largest and longest EVD outbreak in history,3 involving several developed and developing countries. Fears of cross-border transmission resulted in over 50 countries around the world issuing travel restrictions to and from EVD-affected countries.9 Second, the epidemic garnered international support, including significant investment in the research and development of vaccines10 and therapies11,12 for EVD infection, although the response was slow and arguably inadequate.13,14 Third, it stimulated debates at many international, regional, and national fora about compassionate access to experimental regimens for therapy during epidemics and alternative clinical trial designs to test the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and therapies. The debates resulted in guidelines being developed,15 and considerations for revised ethical guidance on clinical trial design and sharing of biospecimens and data.16 Actions are also being taken to institute structural measures for improved emergency response capacities around the world.3",

Accordingly, we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the West African EVD outbreak from a perspective that is grounded in a critique of the social and structural elements that contributed to the deprivation of the individuals and communities that bore the brunt of the epidemic. These include ethical analysis of public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, protection of health care workers, and travel restrictions. We also analyzed the debates that had taken place regarding research ethics, including the conduct of research during public health emergencies, the ethics of randomization, standards of care both within and outside research studies, and the sharing of biospecimens and related data internationally. Finally we considered the ethical issues surrounding the topic of EVD survivors.",

            "text": "Quarantine helps to contain new infections during an infectious disease outbreak.35 One of the criticisms of the initial outbreak response was that the quarantine was poorly managed. Koch35 and Barbisch et al36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for \u201cspatial\u201d quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the \u201cprinciple of least infringement\u201d, an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty.37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties.37",

We consider, however, that the probable benefits of a restrictive measure for health care workers returning to their home country are not sufficient to justify any burden placed on individuals through the restriction of their liberty, taking into consideration any probability.40 Subsequently, the quarantine order for health care workers returning to their homeland from the EVD zone was deemed counterproductive and \u201cmorally wrong\u201d by the President\u2019s Bioethics Commission.41 The action was also not evidence based, infringed the right to liberty of affected individuals,42 fueled stigma,43,44 and constituted a roadblock to the ongoing EVD response.45 It imposed barriers to the movement of health care workers to and from affected areas and impeded their ability to contribute their skills to the management of the public health emergency.45",

There were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. Much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality.67\u201371 Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty, and therefore justified randomization to experimental treatment versus placebo.72\u201374 Also, drug registration for licensure would require data generated through randomized clinical trials.70,71 Those in favor of alternative trial designs67,68,75\u201378 noted that ethical standards guiding therapeutic research should be flexible enough to give the dying \u201ca chance at rescue\u201d.78 Also, alternative research designs facilitated access of persons to experimental products to reduce the risk of fatality, especially with promising experimental products.67,78,79 The Ebola ca Suffit trial provided evidence on the suitability of an alternative vaccine trial design to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a vaccine.80",

This raises ethical issues about informed consent. While informed consent ought to be obtained before taking any specimen, caring for very ill people focused on survival in often suboptimal treatment units makes this difficult. Also, there are concerns about obtaining informed consent from minors who may not have parents or guardian present while quarantined, or the parents may have died as a result of the epidemic. In the case of deceased people, the USA regulations do not require consent before taking biospecimens. It is, however, recognized that deceased people may have had interests and values regarding the use of their specimens that should be respected.86 Similarly, the USA does not require consent for use of deidentified specimens, but the ethical concerns still hold, since genomic research, where data cannot truly be deidentified given that every human genome is unique, is possible.48 Jecker et al87 therefore identified the need for additional guidance on the challenges of obtaining informed consent for collecting and sharing biospecimens in the context of a public health emergency.",

Altogether, 26,350 persons were managed for EVD infection and 11,315 lives were lost.97 The extensive casualty and the embargoes on travels and movements during the outbreak also affected trade and agriculture, resulting in food insecurity in affected countries.98 The impact of the epidemic on education remains unmeasured, yet the fact that schooling was extensively disrupted would have short-, medium-, and long-term consequences at the individual, family, and community/national level. Extensive donor investment in the EVD response also has implications for funding of other research in the region as research funds were moved away from other disease areas to address the EVD emergency response needs.99 The instituted infection control measures also affected social interactions, although the scope of impact of EVD epidemic on the social dynamic of affected countries remains largely unknown and would be difficult to measure because pre-epidemic data are rarely available due to the unpredictable nature of disease outbreaks. However, it is known that infectious diseases have severe impact on biodiversity.100\u2013102",
