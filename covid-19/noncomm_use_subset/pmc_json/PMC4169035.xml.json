Two-thirds of all IgGs contain the kappa (\u03ba) light chain (Lc) isotype, with the remainder containing the lambda (\u03bb) Lc.1 This well-studied structure provides a relatively stable scaffold, as well as unique Fc effector functions such as complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), making human IgG1 a natural and desirable choice for therapeutic antibody development in oncology. Considerable effort has focused on improving the stability and Fc function of this IgG1 subclass through protein and glycan engineering.2-8 Twenty-two of 27 FDA approved therapeutic antibodies belong to the human IgG1 subclass.9 Among approved IgG1s, IgG1\u03ba is the predominant isotype.10 The bias toward the \u03ba isotype is likely due to the fact that most of these antibodies are chimeric or humanized derivatives of antibodies generated from mouse, in which the ratio of IgG\u03ba to IgG\u03bb isoform is 19:1 in serum.11 With the advent of human phage display libraries, which contain a more balanced \u03ba to \u03bb ratio, therapeutic antibody with the IgG1\u03bb isotype has either emerged in clinical pipelines or recently gained market approval.12,13 Previous studies have reported, however, that IgG1\u03bb has a slower assembly rate, and is thus less stable under reducing conditions, than the \u03ba isotype.14,15 Given the recent trend of developing \u03bb Lc-containing antibodies as therapeutics, it is important that we critically examine the molecular basis for the observed instability of IgG1\u03bb and attempt to rationally improve the stability and function of this molecule class.",

            "text": "The reversible nature of disulfide bonds supports their pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of functional proteins, including IgGs. Although a disulfide bond is a covalent linkage with a dissociation energy of 60 kcal/mole in the protein structure, it has been considered a relatively \u201cweak link\u201d in the molecules architecture, being 30% weaker than a carbon-carbon bond (dissociation energy of 83\u201385 kcal/mole).16 Recent findings have shown that disulfide bonds of IgGs are more reversible than previously believed. The Lc from naturally occurring IgG and IgA forms a disulfide bond with the heavy chain (Hc), but also self-associates, thereby creating a Lc dimer.17 Moreover, inter-Hc disulfide bonds of the IgG4 subclass are requisite for the high disulfide exchange rate observed, which enables the transfer of half antibodies (HL) between two antibodies of distinct specificity and the formation of antibodies with dual specificity naturally.18,19 In addition, disulfide bond reshuffling has been reported to occur among different pairs of cysteines between antibody Lc and Hc, and between two Hcs. This leads to multiple disulfide-bonded isoforms of IgG2 molecules detectable by capillary electrophoresis,20 effecting significant molecular heterogeneity in this antibody isoform.21-23 This effect, however, is context dependent and instability of the disulfide bond between Hcs is not observed in the IgG1 isoform. Any unpaired cysteines in recombinant monoclonal antibodies that may result from disulfide bond instability could affect the developability of the molecule by forming covalently linked aggregates.24,25 Among all IgG subclasses, IgG1 has a unique interchain disulfide bonding pattern that bridges the end of the Lc to the N-terminus of the hinge region on the Hc, rather than the beginning of the CH1 domain as observed in other IgG isoforms.26 The Lc to Hc disulfide bond in IgG1 has also been shown to be prone to Lc loss due to the degree of disulfide bond reversibility.14,27 Recently reports have also shown that the disulfide bond between the Lc and the Hc in human IgG1 is weaker than the disulfide bonds present between the two Hcs as monitored by reduction, differential alkylation, and LC-MS analysis.14 More importantly, the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in human IgG1\u03bb is more susceptible to breakage under reducing conditions than that in human IgG1\u03ba.14 Further analysis revealed that the serine residue at the C-terminus of human IgG1\u03bb makes a significant contribution to the susceptibility of this disulfide bond to reduction.27 Altogether, these data imply that the focal environment at the C-terminus of human IgG1\u03bb is likely to affect stability and function through destabilization of the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc.",

This analysis suggested that three mutations in residues proximal to the lambda Lc cysteine, which participates in the interchain disulfide bridge, may contribute to bond stability. Previously, an Hc hinge mutation of a human IgG1 was reported to improve the stability and the function of the parental antibody.28 Moreover, a deletion mutation of a serine residue in a human IgG1\u03bb antibody demonstrated a potential for increasing disulfide bond stability upon partial reduction.27 In this report, the effects of deletion of the terminal serine (dS) from the Lc on the stability and function of a selected human IgG1\u03bb (hereafter referred to as \u03bb) were examined more extensively. The dS variant has a profile for enhanced Lc-Hc disulfide bond stability to heat and elevated pH, and increased transient expression level and purification yield; however, the \u03bb to \u03ba substitutions, P210R and A211G, failed to improve the stability of the parental hIgG1\u03bb. Interestingly, this dS mutant demonstrated improved ADCC activity as well. The results of this study suggest a simple engineering approach to increase the stability, production, and the Fc function of an IgG1\u03bb antibody by deleting the terminal serine of Lc, but also confirm that the terminal serine is the only liability in the vicinity of the \u03bbLc cysteine in destabilizing the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond from a human IgG1\u03bb.",

The most distinct feature of C\u03bbs compared with C\u03bas is the presence of a serine residue immediately following the cysteine residue that forms the interchain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc at the upper hinge of IgG1 (Fig. 1A and B). In contrast, the glutamic acid residue positioned immediately before the cysteine residue is strictly conserved across C\u03bbs and C\u03bas.",

Since IgG2 and IgG4 have unique Lc-Hc disulfide bond patterns and different cysteine locations in Hc from IgG1, they were also excluded from our discussion by this residue number criterion. To avoid inaccuracies from coordinates, only the crystal structure with a resolution higher than 3 \u00c5 was selected. A complete analysis on multiple C\u03bb structures is desired as the first step to understand whether there is common structural feature around the Lc-Hc disulfide bond in hIgG1\u03bbs; however, due to a limited number of \u03bb antibody entries in PDB and largely flexible tails of Lc, the search only returned one entry for hIgG1 C\u03bb\u20131AQK (Lambda I subfamily), and 12 hIgG1 C\u03bas with complete and ordered Lc-Hc disulfide bonds (Table 1). Other Fab structures from PDB become disordered in the C-terminal region at or near the cysteine in Lc. By sequence comparison, 1AQK shares high sequence identity in both C\u03bb and Lc with the tested \u03bb antibody (78% identical in hIgG\u03bb Lc; 97% identical in C\u03bb) (Fig. 1A). 1AQK was therefore used as the representative structure for our tested \u03bb antibody and compared with other hIgG1 C\u03bas. Although the conclusion from the structural analysis could not be generalized due to the lack of multiple examples of complete C\u03bb Lc-Hc disulfide bond from hIgG1, the structural feature from 1AQK is believed to serve as a representation of our selected \u03bb antibody discussed here given the high sequence identity in both C\u03bbs (Fig. 1A).",

In most structures, within each C\u03bb or C\u03ba domain, the B factors of atoms from cysteine at the C-termini are higher than those from residues located prior to the C termini. The difference highlights the flexible nature of the protein in the region surrounding the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in both C\u03bb and C\u03ba. The average B factors of the cysteine residues (equivalent to C215 in 1AQK) involved in the Lc-Hc disulfide bond and the adjacent conserved glutamic acid residues (equivalent to E214 in 1AQK) in both C\u03ba and C\u03bb from all Lcs were calculated and compared (Fig. 1A; Table 1). Due to the lack of multiple entries for C\u03bb, the average per residue B factor in 1AQK was directly compared with the overall average per residue B factor at the equivalent C215 or E214 location from 12 available C\u03ba structures. At cysteine location, the average B factor is 79.96 \u00c52 for C\u03bb, in contrast to an overall average B factor of 58.72 \u00c52 from 12 C\u03bas. Likewise, the average B factor of the conserved glutamic acid residue (E214 in 1AQK) of C\u03bb is 80.13 \u00c52, higher than that of 52.46 \u00c52 from all C\u03bas. From our observation with limited sampling on C\u03bb, the elevated B factors for both E214 and C215 from 1AQK indicate a more flexible nature for atoms at or near the Lc-Hc disulfide bond in C\u03bb and a more destabilizing environment for such a disulfide bond in both C\u03bbs from 1AQK and possibly our selected \u03bb antibody under discussion.",

The CH1 domains of 1AQK and 1Y0L Fabs were superimposed as they are 99% identical (Fig. 2). The RMSD of C\u03b1 atoms across 100 aligned residues from both CH1 domains is 1.2 \u00c5. Overall, the conformations around the cysteine residues at the C-termini of C\u03bb and C\u03ba are found to be very different. Several observations indicate that the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in a Fab containing a \u03bb Lc is potentially less stable than the inter-chain disulfide bond in a Fab with a \u03ba Lc. First, C214 of C\u03ba points toward CH1, forming a disulfide bond with C233 (H),whereas at the C215 position of C\u03bb the main chain makes a 90 degree turn away from C226 (H) of CH1 (Fig. 2), to accommodate the extra serine residue (S216) in C\u03bb and to avoid steric interference with the CH1 domain (Fig. 2). In addition, the strength of the lambda Lc-Hc disulfide bond could also be negatively affected by the interaction with the trailing serine residue. Given the high flexibility at the end of C\u03bb, the amide group of S216 (C\u03bb) could form a hydrogen bond, thereby weakening the disulfide bond.39 The negative charge of the carboxyl group at the C-terminus of the \u03bb Lc could initiate a nucleophilic attack, potentially weakening the disulfide bond between \u03bb Lc and Hc.39 Interestingly, the hydroxyl side chain of the terminal serine is oriented on the opposite side of the disulfide bond, making it less likely that this side chain functional group is involved in the destabilization. Consistent with our observation, a serine to alanine mutation at the end of the \u03bb Lc did not reduce the inter-chain disulfide bond susceptibility to reduction.27",

At room temperature (25\u00b0C), both antibodies remained largely intact. The primary species migrated at a molecular weight of ~150 kD (LHHL) (Fig. 3A). At 90\u00b0C both antibodies became dissociated as evidenced by the appearance of several bands of lower molecular weight. The intensity of these banding patterns is visibly greater for the \u03bb Lc antibody. For the \u03bb Lc antibody, the primary band migrated at 150, 125 and 100 kD, suggesting the loss of one (HHL) and two Lcs (HH) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, only a minimal amount of the species at 75 kD (HL) was observed, which implied that only the Lc-Hc disulfide bond, but not the Hc-Hc disulfide bond, was negatively affected by the \u03bb Lc. In contrast, at the same temperature, the \u03ba showed only moderate loss of two Lc, resulting in a band with much weaker intensity than that of \u03bb at 100 kD (HH). The percentage of intact \u03ba was determined to be 70%, whereas that for \u03bb was only 30% (Fig. 3A).

Three mutants that introduced residues found in \u03ba Lcs were created by site-directed mutagenesis: \u03bbdS (S214 deletion), \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R. The location of these select residues was based on the lack of sequence identity at these positions between C\u03bb and C\u03ba across multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 1A and B). To ensure that the variants retained biological function, binding to targeted receptor X was tested in an antigen down ELISA. Compared with \u03bb (EC50 = 0.63 nM), the mutants had similar EC50s for receptor X binding, ranging from 0.57\u20130.95 nM, indicating no alteration in binding properties arose as a result of the directed mutations in the Lc constant region (Table 3). The thermal stability of native \u03bb and these mutants was then evaluated. The patterns of Lc and Hc association for \u03bbdS, \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R were determined at RT, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90\u00b0C and compared with the native \u03bb (Fig. 3B\u2013D). The intact IgG ratio (defined as staining intensity of LHHL relative to the staining intensity of all species) was also determined for each antibody at different temperatures (Fig. 3E). Only \u03bbdS displayed markedly improved association between Lc and Hc, based on reduced level of the HH (100 kD) and H (50 kD) species (Fig. 3B) and an increased amount of LHHL (Fig. 3E). Mutations at A211G and P210R in \u03bb did not enhance the stability of the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, as the levels of partial IgG species at each temperature were similar to the levels in the native \u03bb (Fig. 3C and D). The intact IgG ratio for \u03bbdS decreased at a much slower rate with increasing temperature relative to native \u03bb, \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R. As a result, 75% of \u03bbdS remained intact at 90\u00b0C, similar to the \u03ba control antibody (Fig. 3A and E). By contrast, only about 40% of the intact IgG remained for native \u03bb, \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R under these conditions. Surprisingly, a single serine deletion from the C terminus of \u03bb Lc led to a more stable Lc-Hc disulfide bond. Since \u03bb to \u03ba mutations prior to cysteine did not demonstrate improvement in stabilizing the Lc-Hc disulfide, only dS mutant was tested in the following studies.",

At pH 7.0, the serine deletion mutant was as stable as the kappa Lc IgG1, \u03ba, whereas the lambda Lc IgG1 \u03bb showed some loss of Lc, indicating greater susceptibility of the Lc-Hc disulfide bond to breakage. Striking differences in stability were seen at pH = 10.0 (Fig. 4). The majority of the IgG1\u03bb antibody lost both Lcs, as the dominant species was HH (~110 kD, Fig. 4). A moderate amount of the HHL form is also present, indicating the loss of one Lc from \u03bb (Fig. 4). Only a very minimal amount of \u03bb remained as an intact IgG. In contrast, 50% of both Lcs remain stably attached to the Hcs of \u03ba (Fig. 4). There was only moderate loss of both Lcs (HH species) compared with \u03bb. At high pH, \u03bbdS was more stable than \u03bb, but not as stable as \u03ba. The serine deletion significantly improved the association between Lc and Hc by stabilizing the inter-chain disulfide linkage, with a significant amount of the mutant (25%) still remaining as intact IgG with both Lcs (Fig. 4). Moreover, the serine deletion mutant showed a higher amount of IgG with only one missing Lc (HHL) and lower amount of IgG with two missing Lc (HH) compared with IgG1\u03bb (Fig. 4). This suggested that deletion of the terminal serine renders the disulfide bond more resistant to breakage at higher pH. The higher susceptibility for \u03bb Lc-Hc disulfide bond to break at more basic pH is likely associated with the combination of greater reduction potential in the high pH buffer and less reduction potential (weaker) of the disulfide bond to be reduced. There is an inverse relationship between pH and redox potential, nominally \u221259 mV/pH unit;40 therefore, increasing pH also lowers the solution potential, rendering it a more reducing environment relative to lower pH. Moreover, by removal of the terminal serine, the Lc-Hc disulfide in \u03bbdS becomes a stronger bond, therefore more resistant to being reduced at basic pH compared with the same bond in \u03bb. In conclusion, we hypothesize this change in potential resulting from increased pH is sufficient to effect the difference in reversibility of this Lc-Hc disulfide bond between \u03bb and \u03bbdS IgG1 tested.",

Transient expression of \u03bbdS was significantly higher than that of \u03bb (160.6 \u00b1 9.5 mg/L vs. 90.4 \u00b1 14.6 mg/L, p = 0.0022) (Fig. 5).

The process analysis was done under elution conditions at pH 3.1. No precipitation was observed for either \u03bb or \u03bbdS during elution from the column or during the subsequent hold step at low pH. When \u03bbdS was eluted from the column at pH 3.1, process yield was high (97.4%). By contrast, only 85.4% of the \u03bb loaded on the Protein A column was eluted under the same conditions. As the elution pool was neutralized to pH 7.0 using 2 M solution of Tris base, precipitation occurred to a similar extent for both \u03bbdS and \u03bb, based on turbidity of the solution. The high recovery in the clarification step following neutralization, however, indicated that the precipitation was due to host cell protein impurities, not the antibody. These findings demonstrate improved transient expression and performance during purification of the engineered serine deletion mutant. The enhanced expression and purification processes of the \u03bbdS mutant are likely attributed to better assembly between dS Lc and Hc when the IgG is produced.",

While it is possible that the side chain of the terminal serine residue could introduce steric hindrance that destabilizes the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, structural comparison of \u03bb and \u03ba Lcs suggests that features in the backbone of the amino acid are responsible for the observed destabilization. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of two mutations at the C-terminus of \u03bb Lc from a previous study. By partial reduction and differential alkylation with 12C/13C iodoacetic acid, ~81% of the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc was reduced to free cysteine in both native IgG1\u03bb with a terminal serine and a variant IgG1\u03bb with a terminal alanine.27 In contrast, only 41% of the same disulfide bond between Lc and Hc was reduced to free cysteine in a variant IgG1\u03bb with the terminal serine residue deleted.27 The lack of resistance to reduction in the alanine mutant is likely because alanine preserves the characteristics of the serine main-chain backbone. While the previous report pointed out the liability of the terminal serine for stability, it only focused on characterization of the difference among Lc mutants in susceptibility to chemical reduction. The current report, encompassing sequence, structure, stability and functional characterization provides insight into the molecular basis for the differences between the selected IgG1\u03bb and IgG1\u03bb dS in stability and function, and also provides the first complete analysis of the effect of the terminal serine on the properties of a human IgG1\u03bb.",

This is supported by recent findings.43 Various building blocks, including scFvs, single domain protein scaffolds, and peptides, have been linked to the C terminus of CL of IgGs to construct muti-specific antibodies.43,44 Consistent with our observations and those of others that the extra serine in C\u03bb weakens the Lc-Hc disulfide bond, the addition of extra amino acids (scFv or peptide) following the last cysteine of a human IgG1 C\u03ba destabilizes the Lc-Hc disulfide bond, leading to an increase of partially assembled IgG fusion molecules (HHL or HH) compared with the native IgG molecule by western blot analysis.43 In such a case, the disruption of the naturally occurring Lc-Hc disulfide bond does not appear to affect the binding, serum stability, or stability at low pH.43 However, the effect of the loss of this covalent linkage between Lc and Hc on function might vary from molecule to molecule.

From a recent report, an H229Y mutation in the upper hinge of the Hc from a human IgG1 antibody improved both the stability and the ADCC function (by 3-fold) by preventing cleavage of the Hc-Hc disulfide bond through radical-induced degradation.28 The enhancement of ADCC activity by the H229Y is correlated with a higher affinity for Fc\u03b3R.28 Unlike the H229Y mutant, \u03bbdS did not show improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa V158, Fc\u03b3RIIIa F158 or Fc\u03b3RIa by ELISA compared with the native IgG (data not shown). Nevertheless, the serine deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced ADCC activity. The improvement in ADCC activity resulting from the deletion of the terminal serine was interesting and unexpected. This suggests that the increase in ADCC activity resulting from the serine deletion in the \u03bb Lc is operating through mechanisms different from the mutation in the upper hinge region of the Hc. The discrepancy between the results from binding and ADCC assays in our study might be due to differences in the assay formats. It is hypothesized that a conformational change in the hinge region induced by the deletion of serine could affect the Fc\u03b3R binding site only upon binding to both cell surface antigen and cell surface Fc\u03b3R, which occur only in the ADCC assay, but not in the ELISA binding assay. This hypothesis was partially corroborated by our effector cell activation data where \u03bbdS induced a greater increase in the activation of Jurkat cells than the parental \u03bb antibody upon binding to target cells. Additionally, unlike the hinge stabilizing mutant H229Y, a more stable disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc due to deletion of the terminal Lc residue is likely to have more indirect effect on the stability of the hinge and less effect on Fc\u03b3R binding. In conclusion, further studies are needed on the detailed mechanism of ADCC enhancement resulting from the deletion of the C-terminal serine of C\u03bb in order to determine whether the effect can be generalized to other antibodies.",

Therefore, molecular changes at or around hinge region are less likely to alter the PK properties of the antibody. The dS mutant did not improve the PK properties of \u03bb, which is consistent with data showing that the Hc hinge mutation, H229Y, also did not alter the PK properties of human IgG.28 Moreover, it was reported previously that the PK profile remains the same when the entire C\u03bb is switched to C\u03ba in human IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4.15",

Inferior stability of the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc could potentially hinder the successful development of human IgG1\u03bb antibodies as a class of effective therapeutic agents. The study presented here, focusing on the region around the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, provides extensive characterization of the stability and function of a human IgG1 \u03bb antibody, and suggests a critical role for the C-terminal serine residue of \u03bb Lc in the stability of the Lc-Hc interaction in human IgG1\u03bb. More importantly, we demonstrated that deletion of the serine enhances the stability, expression, processability and ADCC activity without affecting binding to antigen. This examination of the properties of a specific pair of \u03bb and \u03bbdS antibodies might represent a unique case, but the analysis presented in this report serves as a general framework for testing other antibodies of human IgG1\u03bb isotype. Further investigation with a large number of human IgG1\u03bbs will confirm whether the deletion of the C-terminal serine from \u03bbLc is a general platform for improving the properties of human IgG1\u03bb, reducing the time and cost to develop this class of molecules for therapeutic use.",

To generate a restricted Lc-Hc disulfide bond subset of the database for human IgG1, the following criteria were applied to the Disulfide Bond Analysis database: (1) Restrict the selection to \u201cImmune System\u201d for header column; (2) Limit the resolution to better than 3 \u00c5; (3) Remove the entries that contain Lc dimers; (4) Select the disulfide bond with the residue number of cysteine between 200\u2013250. The advantage of subsetting the original Disulfide Bond Analysis database is that all the PDB entries selected have a complete Lc-Hc disulfide bond already, in comparison to a search directly against PDB. The final hIgG1 Lc-Hc disulfide bond database contains 1 hIgG1\u03bb Fab sequence and 12 hIgG1\u03ba Fab sequences. Disulfide bond strain energy and bond distance were obtained directly from the Disulfide Bond Analysis database.34 The average B factor per residue for cysteines (equivalent to C215 in PDB 1AQK) and glutamic acids (equivalent to E214 in 1AQK) for these 13 CLs were calculated for comparison. The Chi1 torsion angle for every C\u03bb or C\u03ba cysteine involved in interchain disulfide bond was calculated using program Coot.37 The deviation (\u0394Chi1) of each cysteine Chi1 from the closest Chi1 reported from a rotamer database from Coot was also calculated and compared.",

Three mice per time-point were bled for plasma at t = 6 h, and on 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 d after dosing for each \u03bb or \u03bbdS group. EDTA plasma samples were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until the concentrations were evaluated with a standard anti-human Fc binding ELISA. Briefly, the Immunlon plates (VWR, 62402-972) were coated with goat anti-human Fc IgG (Sigma, I2136). Serial diluted IgG standards and plasma samples were incubated with the coated plates followed by the detection with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti human Fc IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-035-098). PK parameters were calculated utilizing noncompartmental analysis with WinNonLin software (Pharsight). PK parameters were calculated based on 24\u2013672 h time points for all groups.",
