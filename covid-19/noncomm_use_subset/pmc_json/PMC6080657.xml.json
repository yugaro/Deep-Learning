Fibrosis affects almost every organ of the body, causing irreparable damage wherever it occurs (Carver and Goldsmith, 2013). As fibrosis is an outcome of so many distinct disease states, it is considered a leading cause of death (Tsou et al., 2014).",

However, it remains unclear how cells normally tasked with directing wound repair are signaled to alter their fate and differentiate to myofibroblasts, the cell type associated with fibrosis. Key features of myofibroblast differentiation include 1) high levels of expression of the intermediate filament protein vimentin, a mediator of cell migration and wound repair; 2) expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and its organization into the stress fibers that mediate myofibroblast contractile function; and 3) production of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen I that are secreted into the extracellular milieu. These myofibroblast properties create an aberrant microenvironment that leads to loss of tissue function.",

            "text": "Vimentin has emerged as a critical regulator of the wound-\u00adhealing process in many distinct tissues and cell types. In studies of skin wound\u2013repair, this protein has been demonstrated to function as a signaling integrator in tissue regeneration and healing (Cheng et al., 2016). Our own studies with an ex vivo, mock-cataract-surgery (MCS), epithelial wound\u2013healing model have shown that vimentin is a defining characteristic of a resident mesenchymal \u201crepair\u201d cell population (Walker et al., 2010) that is located in niches among the cells of the lens equatorial epithelium. This mesenchymal cell population is activated on wounding to immediately migrate to and populate the leading edge of the injured epithelium (Walker et al., 2010; Menko et al., 2014a). Vimentin is required for the function of this mesenchymal leader cell population in directing the collective migration of the injured epithelium to close the wound (Walker et al., 2010; Menko et al., 2014a). Furthermore, we have found that when these cells are activated by wounding, they are also conferred with the ability to invade, a phenotype that is also dependent on vimentin (Bleaken et al., 2016). This finding is consistent with other studies showing that vimentin is required for an invasive-cell phenotype (Satelli and Li, 2011).",

Mice lacking vimentin have exhibited both reduced scarring following corneal injury (Bargagna-Mohan et al., 2012) and a diminished fibrotic response to bleomycin-induced injury of the lung (dos Santos et al., 2015). However, the role of vimentin in inducing the fibrotic response and the specific features of vimentin that are associated with the fibrotic phenotype are not yet clear.",

            "text": "While long understood for their role as a highly stable, stress-resistant cytoskeleton, vimentin intermediate filaments are now appreciated as highly dynamic structures that exist in distinct assembly states and subcellular distributions that define their functions (Lowery et al., 2015; Herrmann and Aebi, 2016). The different states of vimentin organization range from nonfilamentous precursors to unit filaments to a highly organized cytoskeletal network, each with distinct cellular tasks (Herrmann et al., 2009; Lowery et al., 2015; Herrmann and Aebi, 2016). Soluble forms of vimentin are associated with signaling (Perlson et al., 2005), while an organized vimentin cytoskeletal network is critical to processes such as resisting stress and providing cell shape (Goldman et al., 2012). The assembly state of vimentin is regulated through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that also modulate vimentin function. Two key PTMs linked to increased vimentin solubility are phosphorylation and citrullination (deimination). Some of the phosphorylation PTMs are known to trigger disassembly of intermediate filaments (Ando et al., 1989). Vimentin citrullination, which results from the conversion of an arginine to a citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes, prevents vimentin assembly and promotes vimentin filament disassembly (Inagaki et al., 1989). In its soluble form, vimentin can function as an extracellular molecule that has been implicated in the repair process, as shown in a spinal cord injury model (Teshigawara et al., 2013; Shigyo et al., 2015; Shigyo and Tohda, 2016), and in modulating macrophage function in bacteria killing (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003). In studies with our ex vivo MCS-wounded-explant cultures, a model that closely replicates the features of wound repair in vivo, we now investigate how a resident mesenchymal repair cell population that modulates repair of the injured lens epithelium can become misdirected and become an underlying cause of the aberrant wound-healing response of fibrosis. We show, for the first time, a role for extracellular vimentin in promoting the differentiation of these mesenchymal repair cells to the myofibroblast phenotype associated with fibrosis.",

They were conducted with the ex vivo MCS culture model we originally established to investigate mechanisms of wound repair (Walker et al., 2007, 2010,  2015; Menko et al., 2014a). This wound model has clinical relevance to fibrosis, as cataract surgery often elicits a fibrotic response, resulting in the disease known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (Wormstone et al., 2009; Wormstone and Eldred, 2016; Nibourg et al., 2015). We focus on the resident population of vimentin-rich, mesenchymal repair cells of the lens that, on MCS injury, are activated to migrate to and rapidly populate the wound edge of the lens epithelium (Figure 1A, D1 postinjury, repair cells at the MCS wound edge colored purple, arrow) (Walker et al., 2010). Here, functioning as classical leader cells, these cells direct regenerative repair of the injured epithelium, a task that is vimentin dependent (Menko et al., 2014a; Bleaken et al., 2016).",

The cuts made to flatten the explants are additional injury sites that form the outside edge of the explant. These sites of injury are also rapidly populated by the wound-activated resident mesenchymal repair cells (Figure 1A, repair cells at the cut edge colored purple, arrowheads). These mesenchymal cells lead the lens epithelial cells from their original position on their native lens basement membrane capsule onto and across the adjacent, rigid tissue culture substrate. We refer to the region on the tissue culture plastic that the cells occupy postwounding as the extracapsular zone (ECZ). Formation of the ECZ in response to injury is best observed by time-lapse microscopy (Supplemental Video 1, representative still images shown in Figure 1, Bi\u2013Biii). Live imaging revealed that the mesenchymal cells at the leading edge extend and retract lamellipodial protrusions along the substrate as they lead the forward movement of the wounded epithelium across the culture substrate. This behavior closely parallels the injury response we have observed for these resident repair cells previously, when they populate the leading edge of the MCS-wound and direct wound closure on the endogenous basement membrane substrate of the lens (Menko et al., 2014a; Bleaken et al., 2016).",

Here we examined whether vimentin was also a defining feature of the repair cells in their function as leader cells of the ECZ. Following immunolabeling for vimentin at D2 postinjury, the MCS-wounded-explant cultures were imaged in regions of the ECZ typical of the boxed area in Figure 1Biii. The leading-edge cells of the ECZ expressed high levels of vimentin, prominently localized to the lamellipodial protrusions that extend along their substrate surface (Figure 1, C and D, arrows). The organization of vimentin in these cells was examined in cultures fixed with either formaldehyde (Figure 1, C and E) or methanol (Figure 1, D and F), and the cells were imaged by both confocal (Figure 1, C and D) and superresolution confocal (Figure 1, E and F) microscopy. Methanol fixation, which extracts membrane lipids, highlighted the organized vimentin cytoskeleton in the leader cell population. Immunostaining of formaldehyde fixed cultures, permeabilized with Triton X-100 postfixation, revealed both a diffuse pattern of vimentin labeling and organized vimentin filaments. This suggests that formaldehyde fixation may enhance preservation of soluble vimentin populations.",

Reprogramming of cells to a myofibroblast phenotype is characterized by the induction of \u03b1SMA and its organization into stress fibers (Skalli et al., 1989; Schmitt-Graff et al., 1994). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from cells isolated from the ECZ of MCS-wounded-explant cultures from D1 to D6 postinjury showed that \u03b1SMA was first expressed by ECZ cells at culture D3 and increased greatly by D6 (Figure 2A). Since the ECZ is composed of both lens epithelial cells and the lens-resident, vimentin-rich repair cells that populate the wound edge postinjury, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to determine where in the ECZ the \u03b1SMA-expressing cells were localized. Confocal image analysis at culture D3 revealed that \u03b1SMA stress-fiber-positive myofibroblasts emerged exclusively at the leading edge of the ECZ (Figure 2, B and C), the area populated by the vimentin-rich leader cells (Figure 1, C and D). The presence of myofibroblasts at the leading edge of the ECZ had increased greatly by D6 postwounding (Figure 2, D and E), in part due to their proliferation (Supplemental Figure 1).",

The stiffness of the collagen gel is in range of the rigidity of fibrotic tissues (Wells, 2013). Appearance of myofibroblasts in the ECZ of MCS-wounded explants cultured on the collagen I gel substrates was determined by confocal microscopy imaging following immunolabeling for \u03b1SMA. The results show that on collagen gels of 25 kPa, the leading-edge cells had differentiated to \u03b1SMA+ stress-fiber\u2013containing myofibroblasts on D3 (Figure 2F).",

This approach took advantage of our ability to specifically tag the vimentin-rich repair cells at the leading edge of the ECZ with the extracellular domain CD44 antibody (Figure 1G). For these studies, the mesenchymal leader cells were tagged with the CD44 antibody by live labeling for 20 min at D1 post\u00adinjury. Then the cultures were grown through culture D3 when myofibroblasts first appear in the ECZ. To determine whether the cells labeled with CD44 at D1 had differentiated to myofibroblasts at D3, the cultures were fixed, the CD44-antibody-tagged cells labeled with a fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody, and the cells in the ECZ coimmunolabeled for \u03b1SMA. Confocal image analysis showed that all \u03b1SMA+ stress-fiber-expressing cells in the ECZ were positive for CD44 (Figure 3, A\u2013C, arrow). As a control, the cultures were labeled with a nontargeting immunoglobulin G (IgG) of the same isotype as the CD44 antibody. The \u03b1SMA+ cells that emerge in these control cultures were not labeled by the nontargeting IgG (Figure 3, D\u2013F), confirming the specificity of the CD44-tracking studies. These results demonstrate that the CD44+ leader cells, a vimentin-rich cell population, are progenitors of the \u03b1SMA+ myofibroblasts that emerge in the ECZ in response to wounding.",

For these studies, MCS-wounded-explant cultures are placed, cell-side down, on the Matrigel-coated filter of the top Boyden chamber immediately postinjury. Serum-free medium was placed in the top chamber and serum-containing medium in the bottom chamber. As shown in our previous study, at D2 postinjury the wound-activated CD44+/vimentin+ repair cells have invaded through Matrigel to the bottom filter surface of the Matrigel-coated transwell chamber (Figure 3G). The wounded-lens epithelial cells remain associated with their native basement membrane capsule in the top chamber (Bleaken et al., 2016). The vimentin-rich leader cells activated following injury that had invaded to the bottom of the Boyden chamber filter were fixed at culture D10 and immunolabeled for \u03b1SMA.

This suggests that the change in their differentiation state involves a mechanotransduction-signaling event. The cytoskeleton is a key factor in transmitting mechanotransduction signals. Therefore, we compared the organization of the actin and vimentin cytoskeletons in wound-activated repair cells at the leading edge of the MCS wound on the native lens basement membrane capsule to their organization in the leading-edge cells of the ECZ that forms on the tissue-culture substrate. The cultures were colabeled with antibody to vimentin and with fluorescent-tagged phalloidin that labels F-\u00adactin. Cytoskeletal organization was analyzed by confocal microscopy imaging (Figure 4, A\u2013F). The vimentin-rich repair cells at the leading edge of the wound on the cells\u2019 endogenous basement membrane capsule have a well-organized vimentin cytoskeleton (Figure 4, A and C, D1), but this leading-edge population is remarkably F-actin poor (Figure 4, B and C). In contrast, there is a significant population of vimentin that is unorganized in the repair cells at the leading edge of the ECZ, most highly localized to lamellipodial processes these cells extend along the substrate surface (Figure 4, D and F, D2). In contrast to the MCS-wound edge, the leading-edge cells in the ECZ are rich in actin stress fibers (Figure 4, E and F).",

Using a differential detergent extraction approach, we compared vimentin solubility in MCS-wounded explants at the time of injury to cells in ECZ at D2 postwounding (Figure 4G). Cells were extracted sequentially with a Triton X-100/octyl glucoside buffer (Brown and Rose, 1992) that isolates soluble forms of vimentin, including unassembled unit or short vimentin filaments, and a 4% SDS-containing buffer that extracts the highly insoluble vimentin cytoskeletal network. The extracted proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and Western blotted for vimentin (Figure 4G). We immunoblotted for the Triton-soluble protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as control. The Western blot results were quantified and represented graphically as percentage of total vimentin that is soluble (Triton/OG) and insoluble (SDS) (Figure 4G). While at the time of wounding, vimentin was largely present as a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal network, at D2 postinjury in the ECZ, vimentin had become highly soluble, with the majority of the vimentin protein fractionating together with GAPDH in the Triton X-100/OG extracts (Figure 4G). This high level of soluble vimentin was consistent with the diffuse labeling for vimentin observed in the leader cell population of the ECZ (see Figure 4D).",

At 2 d postinjury, protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibody to citrulline and the immunoprecipitated, citrullinated proteins immunoblotted for vimentin (Figure 5A). The results showed that vimentin is present in these citrulline immunprecipitates, indicating that vimentin is citrullinated in the MCS-wounded-explant cultures. Next, we extracted the proteins from the ECZ region at D2 postinjury, electrophoretically separated the proteins, immunoblotted the ECZ extracts for the citrulline PTM, and reprobed for vimentin (Figure 5B). This study demonstrated the citrullinated protein of greatest abundance migrated at 55 kDa and was labeled with antibody to vimentin; this supports the conclusion that vimentin is citrullinated in cells that form the ECZ postwounding.",

Superresolution confocal imaging of the protrusions extended along the substrate by the leader cells of the ECZ showed coincident immunolabeling of citrulline with a subset of the vimentin protein in these cells (Figure 5, F\u2013H). To further examine vimentin citrullination in the lamellipodial protrusions of the leader cells in the ECZ we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) with antibodies to vimentin and the citrulline PTM and postlabeled the cells for F-actin. The results showed a strong vimentin/citrulline PLA signal specific to the cells at the leading edge of the ECZ (Figure 5I).",

            "text": "Although best known as a component of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, vimentin has also been shown to function as an extracellular protein. In this form, vimentin binds to the cell surface at distinct sites, including specific cell-surface receptors, where it initiates a cellular response (Garg et al., 2006; Shigyo et al., 2015). Among the roles identified for extracellular vimentin are the regulation of 1) immune cell function (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003), 2) viral/bacterial entry into cells (Koudelka et al., 2009; Chi et al., 2010; Das et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2011; Du et al., 2014; Mak and Bruggemann, 2016; Yu et al., 2016), and 3) tumor progression (van Beijnum et al., 2006; Satelli and Li, 2011). In studies with our clinically relevant MCS-injury model, we examined whether extracellular vimentin was also a factor in the tissue response to wounding. We began with an immunoblot analysis of conditioned media collected from the MCS-wounded-explant cultures at D1 postinjury, which showed that on injury vimentin was released into the culture media during the repair process (Figure 6A). Medium alone does not contain vimentin. Since in a previous study we found no evidence of cell death following MCS (Walker et al., 2010), we considered this an unlikely source of the vimentin released into the medium. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay analysis performed at D1 postinjury showed that very few cells were TUNEL positive in the MCS-wounded-explant cultures (Supplemental Figure 3), supporting this conclusion. These findings imply that the release of vimentin into the media is an active process of the wounding-healing response.",

Following biotinylation, the ECZ cells were extracted and their biotin-tagged surface proteins isolated on an avidin column. The isolated, biotin-tagged proteins were immunoblotted for vimentin (Figure 6C), for the surface receptor N-cadherin (positive control), and for the cytoplasmic proteins GAPDH and Akt (negative controls) (Figure 6C).

These substrate-associated proteins were extracted and immunoblotted for vimentin, which was shown to be a component of this protein fraction (Figure 6I). Immunoblotting for GAPDH confirmed that these substrate-associated extracellular lysates were largely cell free. In parallel, extracts from the wounded explants that were detached from the dish were immunoblotted for vimentin and GAPDH. In a different approach, the cells in the ECZ were exposed to the membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis (sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) at D2 postinjury to link cell-surface\u2013associated proteins to proteins in their ECM microenvironment. After radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer extraction of cellular proteins the extracellular proteins were coimmunolabeled for vimentin and the ECM protein tenascin-C that forms a provisional matrix on the underlying substrate of ECZ cells migrating in response to wounding. Tenascin-C has been implicated in the induction of fibrosis (Kasprzycka et al., 2015; Bhattacharyya et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). Confocal imaging showed codistribution of tenascin-C and vimentin on the substrate surface in an area underneath the leader cells of the ECZ (Figure 6, J and K).

Those results showed that increasing the concentration of vimentin over that produced by the cells did not alter the timing of myofibroblast emergence or significantly alter the degree of myofibroblast induction in this clinically relevant wound-repair culture model (Supplemental Figure 4). Therefore, we examined the functional roles of extracellular vimentin produced by the cells in response to MCS wounding in both wound repair and the induction of fibrosis. For these studies, the wounded cultures were grown in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to vimentin. To analyze effects on wound closure and emergence of myofibroblasts, we used two distinct vimentin antibodies, AMF17B and H5, with IgG of the same isotype as control. In our previous studies, we have shown that wound closure on the native substrate of the basement membrane capsule is typically complete by D3 post-MCS (Menko et al., 2014a,b). For these studies, antibodies to vimentin were added to the explant cultures at the time of wounding (D0), the cultures imaged daily through culture D3, and open-wound area quantified. Wound repair in the presence of the vimentin antibodies slowed wound closure (Figure 7A), with dynamics and phenotype similar to what we observed previously with small interfering RNA vimentin knockdown (Menko et al., 2014a).",

Both vimentin antibodies suppressed the extension of lamellipodial processes by the leader cells and interfered with the movement of leader cells across the ECZ (Figure 7B). The H5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) had a more potent effect on lamellipodia extension than AMF17B. Biochemical analysis revealed that blocking the extracellular vimentin signal inhibited expression of the myofibroblast protein \u03b1SMA by cells in the ECZ, with H5 being slightly more efficacious at blocking \u03b1SMA expression than AMF17B (Figure 7C). Immunolabeling confirmed that these vimentin antibodies suppressed the differentiation of leader cells to \u03b1SMA+ myofibroblasts (Figure 7, E and F and H and I). The isotype IgG control had no effect on either cell migration or the development of fibrosis (Figure 7, D and G). We also treated the ex vivo MCS cultures with low doses of Withaferin A (WFA), which targets vimentin-soluble pools to inhibit vimentin function (Bargagna-Mohan et al., 2013) but can also have off-target effects (Vanden Berghe et al., 2012). We found that WFA, added to the media at D1 postinjury, decreased soluble pools of vimentin, altered the motility of the leader suppressing the extension of lamellipodial protrusions along the substrate surface, and blocked emergence of \u03b1SMA+ myofibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (Supplemental Figure 5). Together, these studies show that the extracellular population of vimentin has the potential to regulate leader cell function in the repair process and to signal their differentiation to myofibroblasts.",

We have discovered that the cytoskeletal protein vimentin, which is essential to the normal function of these repair-modulating cells in tissue regeneration, can tip the balance from regenerative to fibrotic repair when these cells encounter a profibrotic microenvironment. Our studies examined this dichotomous role for repair cells in the clinically relevant ex vivo MCS wound-repair/fibrosis culture model. In their native microenvironment of the lens basement membrane capsule, these vimentin-rich mesenchymal repair cells rapidly migrate to the leading edge of the MCS wound where they direct lens epithelial tissue repair in a vimentin-dependent manner. When these same repair cells move to the outside edges of the MCS explant cut to flatten the lens capsule on the substrate, they lead lens-epithelial cells off the lens capsule onto and across the culture dish, where these vimentin-rich leader cells are induced to differentiate to \u03b1SMA+ myofibroblasts, the cell type associated with fibrotic disease. This same change in cell phenotype was induced when these repair cells encounter a collagen gel microenvironment whose stiffness is in the physiological range of fibrotic tissues.",

            "text": "While extracellular vimentin has been localized to the cell surface of different cell types, including macrophages (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003), endothelial cells (Xu et al., 2004; Zou et al., 2006; Koudelka et al., 2009; Glaser-Gabay et al., 2011), neutrophils (Moisan and Girard, 2006), astrocytes (Teshigawara et al., 2013), and circulating tumor cells (Satelli et al., 2014, 2016, 2017), its extracellular function has been poorly understood. In the mesenchymal repair cells that populate the leading edge of the ECZ of our MCS-wounded cultures, extracellular vimentin was most highly localized to the cells\u2019 basal surfaces (see model, Figure 8). Vimentin could mediate signaling binding to cell-surface receptors, transmitting a mechanotransduction signal that leads to the change in cell fate associated with fibrosis. In support of this hypothesis, studies have reported that vimentin can act as a ligand for cell-surface receptors, such as CD44 (Pall et al., 2011) and IGF-1R (Garg et al., 2006; Shigyo et al., 2015). While future studies will be aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which extracellular vimentin signals myofibroblast differentiation, our current studies show that the microenvironment is a critical driver of the function of the extracellular pool of vimentin. In wound repair, the microenvironment determines whether vimentin associated with the surface of the mesenchymal cells activated on wounding promotes their role in regenerative repair or their transition to myofibroblasts associated with fibrosis.",

Cells were cultured in complete media (Media 199) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that included 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech-Cellgro, Manassas, VA), and 1% l-glutamine (Mediatech-Cellgro) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The mock cataract surgery is performed after lenses are removed from E15 chick embryos (Poultry Futures, Lititz, PA) to ex vivo culture. This microsurgical procedure removes the fiber cells that comprise the mass of lens tissue (Walker et al., 2007, 2015), leaving the basement membrane that surrounds the lens in vivo as a capsular bag structure containing only the wounded lens epithelial cells and a subpopulation of vimentin-rich mesenchymal repair cells (Walker et al., 2010; Menko et al., 2014a). The lens epithelium and subpopulation of mesenchymal repair cells associated with the lens capsule are placed on tissue plastic cell side up. By making cuts in the anterior aspects of the lens capsule, we flatten the postcataract surgery lens capsular bag with its lens epithelial and mesenchymal repair cells still attached. The resultant star-shaped, flattened explants are placed on the culture dish, cell side up (Figure 1A). The wounded lens epithelial cells are located at the points of the star, surrounding the denuded lens capsule in the center of the explants where the fiber cells had been attached (Figure 1A, asterisk).",

In contrast, in leader cells associated with the profibrotic environment of the ECZ there was a prominent population of vimentin with a diffuse labeling pattern that was highly enriched at the tips of lamellipodial extensions extended along the tissue culture substrate of the ECZ, in additional to a more classical vimentin cytoskeletal network (D, F).

Extracts were immunoblotted for vimentin and GAPDH and the percentage of total vimentin (G) in each fraction was quantified over three independent experiments. Results show that at the time of wounding vimentin was largely a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal network, in contrast to its largely soluble state of organization in the ECZ at D2 postinjury, a finding consistent with the diffuse state of organization of vimentin in leader cells of the ECZ at this time (D, F).
