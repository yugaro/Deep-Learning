PRDC is multifactorial, with both infectious and\nnon-infectious factors contributing to respiratory disease seen in pigs between the ages of\n3 and 6 months. The interaction of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors,\npig-specific factors and management conditions all contribute to the development and impact\nthe severity of PRDC [20]. The most commonly isolated\npathogens are PRRSV, SIV, PCV2, and M. hyopneumoniae. The other pathogens\nassociated with PRDC are S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P.\nmultocida, P. multocida toxin, B. bronchiseptica, H.\nparasuis, M. hyorhinis, M. hyosynovie, PRV, PRCV, PCMV [7, 8, 15, 20]. However,\nno single-reaction diagnostic test currently exists for the simultaneous detection of major\npathogens commonly associated with PRDC. Routine diagnostic methods for detection of viruses\nimplicated in PRDC include virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by direct\nfluorescent antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassay [5] and culture-based methods for bacteria [23]. These methods are time-consuming and require independent tests for each\npathogen. Furthermore, the detection of bacterial pathogens typically depends on\nculture-based methods that can take several days to obtain results. Due to their high\nsensitivity and ease of use, PCR and real-time PCR tests have been developed for several\nagents implicated in the PRDC; however, these tests typically target single pathogens [24]. A multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting five\nporcine viruses including two porcine respiratory viruses was developed [4]. However, to date, there are no diagnostic tests\ncapable of simultaneous detection of multiple major viral and bacterial porcine respiratory\npathogens in a single reaction.",
