Both have successfully crossed the species barrier to allow animal-to-human transmission, and further to allow human-to-human transmission (Song et al. 2005; Reusken et al. 2016). The SARS outbreak in 2003 had a mortality rate of 10% (Anderson et al. 2010), and SARS-CoV was considered the most aggressive coronavirus compared to other human coronaviruses that commonly cause mild to moderate infection in their hosts (van der Hoek 2007). MERS-CoV is the cause of an ongoing outbreak of the respiratory illness MERS (de Groot et al. 2013). At the time of writing, 1791 MERS cases have been confirmed with a mortality rate of approximately 35% (World Health Organization 2016). Both MERS and SARS have higher mortality rates in elderly and immunosuppressed populations (Gralinski and Baric 2015).",

The MERS-CoV proteome is primarily composed of two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab; the latter is generated by a -1 ribosomal slippage frameshift. These proteins are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). NSPs 1\u201310 are products of both polyproteins, whereas NSPs 12\u201316 are only yielded by ORF1ab. NSP11 is unique to ORF1a (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Structural proteins envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are elements of the physical structure that encloses the viral genome and come from distinct reading frames, unlike ORF1a and ORF1ab, which come from overlapping reading frames. Additionally, the structural proteins are the product of subgenomic mRNAs that are joined during discontinuous negative RNA strand synthesis (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Finally, NS3 protein (NS3), NS4A protein (NS4A), NS4B protein (NS4B), NS5 protein (NS5), and Orf8b protein encompass the remainder of the proteome and also arise from distinct reading frames (van Boheemen et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Our approach utilizes genomic sequence data, which is readily available for viruses known to cause disease. However, because most viruses pose no major threat to their host, they pass by unnoticed leaving the majority of virus genome space uncharted. With the availability of cost-efficient genome sequencing technology, and recent developments in the field of viral metagenomics, large-scale identification of viral genome space is on the rise (Rosario and Breitbart 2011; Mokili et al. 2012). By exploring viral diversity, critical components constituting a viral genus\u2019 fitness can be evaluated. Examples such as the common influenza virus illustrate the rapidity of viral gene mutation and in order to maintain immune protection, an annual flu vaccination is recommended. Underway efforts aim to generate broadly neutralizing vaccines whose design accounts for the genomic sequences of multiple types of influenza virus to eliminate frequent re-vaccination against the flu (Giles and Ross 2011, 2012). Development of broadly neutralizing vaccines often relies on the consensus or ancestral sequences of extant viral sequences in order to provide greater coverage for related viruses (Kesturu et al. 2006). Unfortunately, consensus sequences can be misleading, and ancestral sequence reconstruction is error-prone for quickly diverging sequences (McCloskey et al. 2014). In addition, viruses with compact genomes often express proteins with structural disorder that may undergo structural transformations. Although these transformer proteins, like VP40 in Ebola, are masters at changing their structure, and thus expanding their functional repertoire as needed for the life cycle of the virus (Bornholdt et al. 2013), flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein\u2013protein interactions between the virus and its host (Le Breton et al. 2011; Ortiz et al. 2013; Gitlin et al. 2014). The flexibility trait of many viral proteins is a complicating factor in vaccine development. For instance, Dengue virus exhibits serotype-specific antibody affinity that causes antibody-dependent enhancement, an obstacle in the development of Dengue vaccines that protects against all four serotypes (Flipse and Smit 2015). To overcome the hurdle posed by structural flexibility, we propose an additional screening step in identifying potential vaccine or antiviral targets that considers the structural flexibility of the viral proteins. The Structural Genomics Initiatives increased their success rate by excluding proteins predicted to be structurally disordered (Slabinski et al. 2007). A similar approach can perhaps benefit vaccine development. Furthermore, to make this approach robust to potential mutations, minimizing loss in efficacy or resistance, the evolutionary context of sequence and structure must be considered. Thus, we suggest expanding the concept of broadly neutralizing vaccines/antivirals by increasing the diversity of viruses considered if possible. Sites conserved for sequence, structure, and with low disorder propensity among diverse virus protein homologs are very likely to be constrained from 1) changing sequence on evolutionary time scales and 2) undergoing real-time structural transitions. These sites have potential as targets for broad-specificity antivirals or vaccines because conservation makes them broad-specificity and low dynamics avoids targeting a conformational ensemble, which is not only difficult (Yu et al. 2016), but that may change as the sequence diverges (Siltberg-Liberles et al. 2011).",

            "text": "A recent large-scale study of structural disorder in >2,000 viral genomes in 41 viral families found the amount of disorder in different virus families varying from 2.9% to 23.1% (Pushker et al. 2013). It was reported that Coronaviridae has very low disorder content (mean disorder 3.68%) (Pushker et al. 2013). Coronaviridae contains two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are part the Coronavirinae subfamily, from here on referred to as coronavirus (CoV). The lack of disorder is intriguing because it may be important for rewiring interactions between viral proteins and host proteins (Ortiz et al. 2013) and providing opportunities to acquire novel functional sequence motifs (Gitlin et al. 2014). Structural disorder has also been proposed to be important for viral viability, enabling multifunctionality and vigor in response to changes in the environment (Xue et al. 2014). Given the low fraction of structural disorder reported across Coronaviridae, we set out to investigate the conservation of structural disorder and secondary structure across CoV. Sites identified as conserved for structure and lacking disorder can be considered to be vulnerable and druggable in the proteomes of coronaviruses. The structural divergence capacity of these regions is limited, leaving a wider range of the present and emergent coronaviruses susceptible to the effects of potential broadly neutralizing anti-CoV therapies targeting these sites. We will refer to these sites as target sites.",

Betacoronavirus is represented in all phylogenies although the order of the individual subclades varies. Alphacoronavirus is often found as the sister clade or outgroup to betacoronavirus. Deltacoronavirus or gammacoronavirus are the most distantly related to the betacoronavirus. In the nucleocapsid phylogeny, gammacoronavirus is the first outgroup clade to betacoronavirus, and alphacoronavirus is the most distant outgroup. Most NSP trees exhibit some unresolved nodes at junctures immediately preceding terminal nodes. As an effect of the 50% majority rule, most of the 546 resolved nodes are well supported with posterior probability >0.9 for 82% and >0.99 for 68% (supplementary fig.

It should be noted that for NSP5, the entire alphacoronavirus clade is placed within the betacoronavirus clade, as a sister clade to the MERS clade (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). This may be due to increased sequence divergence rates or due to recombination.

Next, the information of secondary structure prediction from PSIPRED and JPred was used to narrow down this list further by only including sites that are not changing their predicted secondary structure state for both predictors. Applying the aforementioned filters to the initial 10,000 sites resulted in one (1) region of five residues or more conserved across all CoV within the N-terminal domain of NSP12: DNQDL (table 4).

Some protein products are only found in the MERS clade, and these were excluded from this study due to insufficient data. Furthermore, for other protein products, some clades may not be represented in our protein families if their proteins were too divergent. This was an important factor in determining the applied BLAST hit cutoffs, as relaxing cutoffs produced alignments with more gaps and increasing stringency reduced the representative pool. Because alignment quality is important due to the sensitivity of both Rate4Site and for phylogenetic reconstruction, the chosen cutoffs are suitable.

If these sequences are rapidly diverging, different sequence motifs will be displayed, reinforcing the notion that flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein\u2013protein interactions between virus and host (Gitlin et al. 2014). Although most CoV proteins have almost no intrinsic disorder, several CoV protein families have homologous sites that display loop in some sequences, helix in others and strands in some (table 3, supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). These sites are not necessarily disordered but they may be conformationally flexible in real-time (with secondary structure transitions in the same sequence, making them difficult to predict) or on evolutionary time-scales (so that different secondary structure elements actually are present in different sequences). The C(HS) and C(L) sites make up approximately 50\u201380% of most multiple sequence alignments. With the common expectation that protein structure is more conserved than sequence these numbers are surprisingly low. Neither PSIPRED nor JPred consistently predicts the same state for 20\u201350% of all sites in these multiple sequence alignments.",

            "text": "It should be noted that, despite the low amount of disordered sites in most CoV proteins, several regions are not conserved in disorder propensity across all sequences, but sometimes the different predictors disagree as in the case of NSP8. Clade-specific disordered regions resulting from indel events suggest that they are not essential to the critical functions of the protein, but could cause gain-and-loss of interactions with its hosts. However, when disorder propensity is only mildly fading for a region that is present across the protein family, it may be important for the fundamental function of the protein. The virus structural proteins that interact to form the virion commonly include an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a capsid protein that together form the machinery that encases, transports, and releases the virus. The interactions between the structural proteins are often regulated by conformational changes like VP40 in Ebola (Bornholdt et al. 2013) and Envelope protein from Dengue virus (Zheng et al. 2014). Conformational changes in these proteins are needed for the virus life cycle. For CoVs, nucleocapsid is the only structural protein that is highly disordered. Yet, rapid evolutionary dynamics of disorder is present in nucleocapsid using two different IUPred cutoffs (0.4 and 0.5) and with DISOPRED2. Even if the different predictors and cutoffs disagree somewhat where regions with rapid evolutionary dynamics are present, these patterns suggest that nucleocapsid may be rapidly changing from one virus to another. It should also be noted that two MERS clade specific inserts around position 241 and toward the C-terminal are consistently predicted to be highly disordered. With inserts and changing structural dynamics between clades or viruses, the questions become 1) which sequence motif are displayed and 2) to what extent are these sequence motifs displayed?",

Altogether, this suggests that various mechanisms for rewiring conformational and functional space are operating in the coronaviruses studied here. If regions symptomatic of conformational and functional flexibility can be avoided in order to identify broad-specificity antiviral targets with potential to be effective against coronaviruses of today and in the future, coronaviruses as a group may become more attractive drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry in the event an additional coronavirus changes host to include humans or increase its virulence.
