Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) are egg-based compounds, which may contain the whole inactivated virus, split virion or subunits, and induce specific antibodies against the hemoagglutinin (HA) component. IIVs are licensed for use in adults and children. IIVs also exist as adjuvated vaccines (with the inclusion oil-in-water emulsions, such as MF59) and as high-dose vaccines, which have been licensed for use in the elderly. A type of cell-based IIV has been licensed in the United States (US) and in some European countries [14]. A live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is available in the US and Canada for use in adults and children, and in Europe for use in children and adolescents. LAIV contains four influenza strains (H1N1, H3N2 and the two prevalent B strains) and is administered intranasally. The attenuated influenza virus replicates in the upper respiratory airways and stimulates the production of specific antibodies in serum as well as in the respiratory mucosa. The effectiveness of LAIV against influenza A(H3N2) and Influenza B viruses is similar to that of IIVs. Nevertheless, LAIV is poorly active against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [15]. A Recombinant Vaccine (RV) has also been developed. This is made up of a purified HA subunit and is expressed in insect cells through baculovirus vectors. The RV is currently licensed for adults and destined for use in subjects who cannot receive other formulations. One major advantage of this vaccine is the short manufacturing process. It could therefore be useful during a pandemic season [16, 17].",
