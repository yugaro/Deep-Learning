When considering s-MDS and healthy cohort only, s-MDS samples were classified correctly 87% of the time (103/119, standard deviation, s.d. ~3.1), and healthy samples at 90% (101/112, s.d. ~2.7). Expanding the classification to all MDS and L patients did not significantly affect classification for s-MDS or healthy cohorts (Fig. 4b).

The autoantibodies displaying increased protein reactivity compared to healthy patients included several unique proteins for t-MDS, s-MDS, and L in both the initial and validation stages (Stage I and II) of our investigation. The finding that increased antibody reactivity for these proteins predominantly occurred in s-MDS patients is consistent with prior data indicating early stage MDS having a higher degree of immune-related abnormalities than later stage patients1617. These proteins are involved in cancer-relevant biological processes such as apoptosis and have associations involving autoimmune responses. Differential reactivity of these antibodies between early stage MDS and healthy individuals also has diagnostic utility since such clinical distinctions morphologically are often difficult27.",

            "text": "The three proteins validated in Stage II of our investigation present a more robust set, showing increased autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients. The detected autoantibody reactivity to the above proteins offers possible new connections between immune response and tumor formation and detection. Of these, we particularly note that AKT3 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 /protein kinase B, gamma), has been known to be actively involved in multiple cancers, including breast cancer2829, tumorigenesis in melanomas3031, lung cancers32 and ovarian cancers33 (cell cycle involvement). In previous studies AKT3 gene overexpression, and deregulation of AKT pathways, have been detected by gene expression profiling2334. In addition, our observation of differential autoantibody reactivity, and corresponding protein levels, make this a compelling case for the involvement of AKT3 in MDS and highlight its potential as a biomarker for the condition in s-MDS. FCGR3A (an IgG receptor) is involved in multiple antibody processes. Fc-receptors have been the target of multiple therapeutic approaches for cancer and inflammatory states35, including FCGR3A36 (genotype association to rituximab response). The FCGR3A protein levels as determined by ELISA showed an opposite trend as compared to the corresponding autoantibody reactivity. While the FCGR3A protein levels may reflect the possibility that the observed autoantibody reactivity is due to \u201cnon-specific\u201d Fc-Receptor interaction rather than increased amount of specific anti-FCGR3A antibody, it does not necessarily imply a correlation between the amount of antigen and the strength of reactivity. In fact, many highly expressed proteins are not autogenic (e.g. albumin, which is a negative acute-phase protein with decreased plasma levels during immune response373839), while a small amount of allergen could trigger severe immune response. ARL8B (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 8B) is involved in lysosome trafficking and positioning, influencing mTOR expression (mammalian target of rapamycin) and autophagosome formation40, and may also be associated to metastasis and tumorigenesis41. Patient classification may be made into two separate classification schemes, prospectively by IPSS or retrospectively (s/t/L or healthy) as considered above. These classification schemes show good overlap as the IPSS Low and Intermediate 1 risk categories account for 27% and 68% respectively of our s-MDS patients (85% total). Using the autoantibody reactivities we classified patients into each of these two classification schemes (retrospective or IPSS), showing better concordance of autoantibody reactivity in stable patients with the retrospective classification rather than IPSS, but slightly lower with healthy patients (90%). As the classification into IPSS does better on healthy patients (100%), this suggests that combining the IPSS classification scheme with the autoantibody reactivities may improve clinical diagnosis of s-MDS patients while maintaining low numbers of false positives in healthy individuals. Furthermore, autoantibody reactivity-based classification relies on direct molecular marker signatures, and may have possible application as an alternative or supplement to the IPSS risk estimation, especially for early detection of s-MDS patients. Finally, the detection of autoantibody reactivity would only require plasma, and be minimally invasive for the patients.",

In our investigation we chose the more sensitive focused protein array approach over traditional chromogenic ELISA for our validation purposes. While we envision that high-throughput, fluorescence-based methods such as protein microarrays may eventually replace traditional chromogenic ELISA in clinical tests, we expect ELISA clinical tests may also be developed in the future based on our findings. Regarding the possible specificity of our findings, although such autoantibody studies have not as yet been reported in other hematologic malignancies, the combined autoantibody reactivity we observed in our MDS patients was distinct from those reported in patients with ovarian13 and prostate14 cancer, diabetes11 and after respiratory infections10. We expect our findings of the increased autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients with relatively prolonged clinical courses will encourage future studies with larger patient cohorts, that will be helpful to further substantiate the prognostic importance of such data and exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The identified autoantibody reactivity may greatly enhance our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for MDS.",

To adjust for probing and scanning procedure variations, inter-array intensities were quantile normalized43.

Additionally, the study was expanded to a much larger cohort (Table 1b). The protein arrays were scanned as described above, with each block corresponding to a different patient, and patient samples performed in duplicates. We used the same inter- and intra-array normalization as in Stage I (Fig. 2a), applied per block, and the signals for each protein spotted were transformed to a normal distribution using a Box-Cox transformation44. Each protein was analyzed using an ANOVA model45, checking for variance in subject subgroup (retrospective classification), replication (duplicate samples, duplicate protein spots), subject age, gender, marrow blast levels (healthy, IPSS blast categories, leukemic status), and randomization effects (batch effects between Stage I or II of the investigation), Fig. 3a. The possible interactions between all the above were also considered. Signals showing significant primary effects but no significant interactions, using Bonferroni post-hoc tests to correct for multiple group and feature comparisons, were selected as high\u2013confidence signals of interest. Additionally, the ANOVA was used to screen out signals showing significant effects due to replication, subject age and randomization.

(c) The binary statistical comparisons between patient subgroups and healthy cohort resulted in different sets of autoantibodies specific to their respective classification. The Venn diagram indicates the overlap between these comparisons, with more candidate biomarkers specific to s-MDS patients than in other subgroups.

The classification involved 5-fold cross-validation and 1,000 repetitions for each data partitioning to assess variance and median classification (see also Supplementary Tables S4\u2013S6). N.B.
