Humans are the only natural hosts of HSV, and HSV infection is almost exclusively limited to epithelial cells and peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons 2. HSV can cause diseases ranging from mild conditions to lethal infections, including mucocutaneous lesions in labialis and skin, herpes keratitis and herpes encephalitis 3. Most of the licensed treatments are based on nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir. However, current treatments are unable to prevent establishment of latency and reactivation of latent virus 4. Due to the drug resistance, side effects, and poor bioavailability associated with current treatments and the lack of an effective HSV-1 vaccine, the discovery and development of novel anti-HSV-1 agents are still urgent.",

For the sake of predation and survival, they have evolved unique venom systems containing neurotoxins, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes and other components. Natural AMPs from scorpion venoms and their derivative peptides have exhibited attractive antiviral activities, and some of these peptides have been studied in previous reports. The recombinant peptide scorpine (RScp) has been reported to inhibit Dengue-2 replication in C6/36 cells 11. A natural amphipathic \u03b1-helical peptide Hp1090 can directly interact with the HCV viral envelope and decrease viral infectivity 12. The scorpion venom-derived synthetic peptide mucroporin-M1 exhibited virucidal activities against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses via a direct interaction with virus envelope 13. Mucroporin-M1 also inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and then reducing the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) 14. Kn2-7, a scorpion venom peptide derivative, can inhibit HIV-1 by direct interactions with viral particles 15. Histidine-rich mutants of another scorpion-derived peptide, Ctry2459, showed significantly enhanced bioavailability and anti-HCV activity 16. Two scorpion venom peptides, Hp1036 and Hp1239, inhibited HSV-117. Recently, a scorpion defensin, BmKDfsin4, was reported to inhibit HBV replication in vitro\n18. Thus, the scorpion-derived AMP library is a rich source of new antiviral agents that are still awaiting further utilization.",

Eval418 disrupted the initial steps of infection but hardly suppressed an established HSV-1 infection, which was speculated to be a result of its poor cellular uptake. Since introducing histidine residues can improve peptide helicity and amphiphilicity, we attempted to modify Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides to improve its cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and subsequently, its antiviral activity. The helicities and amphiphilicities of the peptides were characterized by circular dichroism (CD). Anti-HSV-1 experiments showed that the modified peptides exhibited greater inhibition of HSV-1 than did the parent peptide. Especially, the modified peptide Eval418-FH5 exerted the lowest cytotoxicity and highest anti-HSV-1 activity. The results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses also revealed that Eval418-FH5 had enhanced cellular uptake and a dispersed cellular distribution.",

Briefly, the peptides were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis and C-terminal amidation in a standardized process. Fmoc-rink resin was used as the synthesis resin by Fmoc strategy. Piperidine was used for deprotecting, and HOBt/HBTU was used for coupling. The finished peptides were cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), precipitated with ether and subjected to purification by reverse-phase HPLC on a C-18 hydrophobic resin (Elite-HPLC) in 0.1% TFA using an acetonitrile gradient. The purity of the final material was verified by reverse-phase HPLC, and the mass of the peptide was determined by mass spectrometry (Voyager-DESTR; Applied Biosystems).

Anti-HBV experiments demonstrated that a scorpion-derived short linear peptide, mucroporin-M1, can inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the MAPK pathway and down-regulating HNF4\u03b1 expression 14. Designed histidine-rich peptides from the template of the scorpion venom peptide Ctry2459 showed considerable inhibition against HCV RNA when added at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after infection 16.

Their IC50 values were enhanced from 3.70 \u03bcg/mL to 1.43, 0.86, 0.63 and 0.67 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The abilities of the derivative peptides to inhibit viral entry were also significantly improved compared with that of Eval418.

            "text": "It is worth noting that Eval418-FH5, in which the most histidine residues were introduced, exhibited a significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared with the other derivative peptides. The CC50 of Eval418-FH5 was 106.68 \u03bcg/mL, but the CC50 of Eval418 was 68.50 \u03bcg/mL. Eval418-FH5 also showed a rapid action by clearing more than 50% of PFUs after incubation with HSV-1 for only 5 min. The IC50 of Eval418-FH5 for HSV-1 inactivation and attachment were 0.86 and 0.67 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Therefore, the SIs of Eval418-FH5 were significantly enhanced to 124.05 and 159.22, respectively, whereas those of the wild type peptide Eval418 were 27.62 and 18.51, respectively. The flow cytometry and confocal microscopy results showed that Eval418-FH5 exerted a considerable cellular uptake and a dispersed distribution, which may explain its superior antiviral activity in the presence of an established HSV-1 infection. Thus, the introduction of histidine residues into the hydrophilic face of Eval418 molecules can overcome barriers in cellular uptake, improve antiviral activity and therefore enable the Eval418 derivatives to interact with intracellular HSV-1.",
