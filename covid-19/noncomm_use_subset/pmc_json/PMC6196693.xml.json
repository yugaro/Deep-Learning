            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) has variable presentations ranging from classic presentation of respiratory symptoms to less common presentations such as involvement of lymph nodes and gastrointestinal system and to some rare hematological manifestations.[1] Hematological manifestations of TB vary from common presentations such as anemia and pancytopenia to rare presentations such as immune thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia can be either due to bone marrow infiltration with granuloma or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia presenting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).[23] ITP in association with TB has rarely been reported. In this paper, the authors describe a case of ITP that was later found to be secondary to TB; unfortunately, the diagnosis of TB was delayed because the patient had refused the procedure required to reach a definitive diagnosis during his initial presentation. The purpose of this report is to highlight the association between the two conditions because early diagnosis and treatment are important to avoid an extreme outcome.",

The mechanism of TB-related ITP remains unclear, although it has been postulated that the activation of B lymphocytes by Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to the production of antiplatelet antibodies or that M. tuberculosis may share antigen with the platelets, leading to the production of antiplatelet antibodies.[8] The antiplatelet antibodies were not measured in this patient, as in the 2011 American Society of Hematology guidelines, the evidence to recommend measuring antiplatelet antibodies during diagnosis of ITP is insufficient.[9]",
