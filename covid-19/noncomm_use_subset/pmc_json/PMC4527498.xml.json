[16] reported that asymptomatic endemic C. pecorum infections\nreduce growth rates in calves by up to 48%. They considered that the mechanism of growth\nsuppression by subclinical chlamydial infection was malabsorption of nutrients due to a\nlocal inflammatory response to intestinal mucosal infection. Additionally, despite the\nabsence of clinical signs, chlamydial infection was associated with reduced serum iron\nconcentrations and lower hematocrit values, and infected calves were leukopenic [17]. Mohamad and Rodolakis [15] reported that the persistence of C. pecorum strains\nin the intestines and vaginal mucus of ruminants could cause long-term sub-clinical\ninfection which may affect the animal\u2019s health. This may explain the poor weight gain\nobserved in case 2 after recovery from diarrhea. Further studies on the pathogenesis of\nC. pecorum infections are required.",
