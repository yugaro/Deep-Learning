Ross was speaking of trees, but everyone who has to deal with cell culture knows perfectly well that cells too need company, either in the form of dense seeding, feeder cells, or molecular tricks like adding Rock inhibitor to the medium [1]. Especially stem cells are particularly sensitive to loneliness, which makes them either die or differentiate [2]. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs), the offspring of the primary tumour that set out into the bloodstream and lymphatic system to instigate metastases, may be the ultimate villains, but no exception to the rule, as Nicola Aceto explains in his review [3].",

Twelve years ago, it was shown that the simple co-injection of matrigel potentiated the tumorigenic abilities of a large fraction of melanoma cells, thus triggering the contestation of the cancer stem cell supremacy [5]. To date, the tumour niche is intensely studied, as it became clear that this complex mixture of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells contributes greatly to many cancer hallmarks: angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, stem cell-like properties and growth signalling [6]. Unsurprisingly, this got it also straight into the therapeutic firing line [7].",

The fact that CTCs can bring company however has been theorised a long time ago, but experimentally proven only recently to be shed by many different cancers. Aceto explains the technological innovations that made the latter possible, and outlines the two main strategies in use, based either on antigenic staining or size selection by microfluidics. Subsequently, he outlines the biological features of homotypic clusters, composed of cancer cells only, and heterotypic clusters, a mix of cancer with stromal or immune cells. A key feature of homotypic CTC clusters is the presence of intercellular junctions, a feature that rings a bell, once again, for embryonic stem cell aficionados. It is no secret that tumour cells frequently highjack pluripotency pathways for their advantages, such as unlimited proliferation, immortality and sturdy features [11]. As the author accurately points out, cell\u2013cell junctions are required for the expression of the core set of pluripotency transcription factors, both in native stem cells and cancer cells. Heterotypic CTC clusters consist basically in cancer cells bringing along a little piece of their original stromal niche: fibroblasts, endothelial cells or immune cells. The familiar feeling seems to have the same comforting effect as the primary tumour microenvironment, including better survival and boosted proliferation.",

His Nobel lecture Natures Gift to Science is dedicated to \u201cthe fourth winner of the Nobel prize this year\u201d [12], and referred to no one else than Caenorhabditis elegans. In1974, he elected the 1-mm-long roundworm as his model system of choice in order to study \u201cthe complex structures found in higher organisms\u201d, notably the development of the nervous system [13]. The tiny worm had the right size for electron microscopy, lived happily in a dish filled with E.coli, self-fertilized and produced about 300 new nematodes every 3.5 days [12]. Brenner's first study reported hundreds of mutants and related genes [13]. Since then, C. elegans has become an evergreen model organism for a broad scientific community, and despite the latest trend to go as human-like as possible for some studies (like miniature brains in a dish [14]), the worm has never lost its pertinence for the understanding of both normal ontogenesis and various human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases [15].",

Only recently though, the central role of mitochondria in disorders like diabetes and obesity has received the deserved attention, and been included as a potential therapeutic target [18]. One target might be CISD-1, termed mitoNEET until not too long ago. It belongs to a recently discovered family of iron-sulphur proteins (CISD1-3), which are all linked to the mitochondria in humans, and implicated in a large array of functions ranging from respiration and iron homeostasis to protein biosynthesis [19]. CISD-1 in particular was detected in 2003, when Colca et al. tried to decipher the mechanism underlying the beneficial action of thiazolidinedione against type 2 diabetes, known since the beginning of the 1980s. It turned out that the drug, thought to mainly activate the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3, also cross-linked a novel mitochondrial protein [20]. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how exactly thiazolidinedione and similar compounds impact on CISD-1, and what the downstream molecular events relevant for diabetes treatment are.",

Paul and Montoya dedicate their review to the class II type V CRISPR-Cas12a system, an alternative, so far underappreciated genome-editing tool, which has already proven its worth by correcting muscular dystrophy in human cells and mice [33]. The authors first explain thoroughly how the endonucleases carry out their native function in procaryotes, followed by a detailed account on Cas12a structure and operation mode. Subsequently, by comparing the enzyme with Cas9a, they highlight its advantages, such as the requirement of only one RNA molecule and the possibility to perform multiplex gene regulation, and drawbacks, notably its indiscriminate single strand DNA cleavage activity [34]. Given that the prime editing complex is so far extremely hard to get into cells due to its size, Cas12a has solid chances to encounter broad applications both in genome editing and bioengineering.",

            "text": "One of the very first medical experiments to be carried out on the International Space Station (ISS) was the effect of zero gravity on the Hoffmann's reflex (H-reflex) [38]. A short electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve elicits first an efferent response (M-wave) towards the muscle, then an afferent one towards the corticospinal tract (H-wave), where a motor neuron is activated, leading to the contraction of the muscle located at the initial stimulation spot (H-reflex). In addition, the afferent signal also activates inhibitory interneurons, which dampen the signal before it travels along the motor neuron. Repetitive stimulation leads to the depression of the H-reflex, potentially in order to avoid over-stimulation of the \u03b1 motor neuron and the muscle [39]. The system is frequently disrupted because of spinal disinhibition in various pathologies, such as diabetic neuropathy [40], or after spinal cord injury (SCI) [41], leading to spasticity and pain. Despite the large amount of related studies, it was still unclear whether the inhibition steps in at the pre- or post-synaptic level. Chang et al. decided to shed light on the exact mechanism by testing healthy subjects with a classic rate-sensitive H-reflex, patients with acute sensory-impaired SCI, and healthy individuals lacking the rate-sensitive depression. They combine testing for H-reflex depression with recording of motor evoked potentials (MEP) after direct \u03b1 motor neuron excitation by transcranial stimulation in all three test groups. Observing no decrease in MEP in any group, the authors provide the most solid experimental evidence in humans that the H-reflex takes place at the pre-synaptic level [42].",

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is its most frequent subtype, and the standard treatment consists in surgical removal often followed by radioactive iodine therapy, with very good chances for remission [44,45]. Parathyroid glands in turn are located directly on the back of the thyroid, and in charge of regulating blood calcium levels via the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Excessive PTH production, or hyperparathyroidism (HPT), is mostly caused by benign adenomas, or the consequence of chronic kidney failure. The resulting perturbation of the calcium metabolism can cause various complications ranging from weakness to osteoporosis [46]. Given the physical proximity between the two glands, as well as some reports linking HPT with several cancers [47,48], Tsai et al. undertook to retrospectively investigate if an additional occurrence of hyperparathyroidism impacts PTC cancer prognosis in the long term. They findings indicate that hyperparathyroidism occurs in slightly over 1% OF PTC cases, and has no statistically significant impact on non-remission risk. However, it correlates with an increased non-thyroid cancer related mortality in PTC patients, mainly due to cardiovascular events [49], which are possibly linked to the defective parathyroid function [50].",

            "text": "Colon polyps, small masses of cells on the lining of the colon, are mostly harmless. Nevertheless, some can develop into colon cancer, which ranks 3rd on the list of most frequent cancers, thus early detection by screening and subsequent removal are highly recommended [55]. CT colonography, also called virtual colonoscopy, is an x-ray based imaging procedure where three-dimensional pictures are reconstituted from two-dimensional cross-sections. Compared to conventional colonoscopy, the procedure allows for the visualisation of the entire colon, and is less invasive, discomforting, risky and costly [56]. Yet it is still regarded with some suspicion, because it is less precise for small lesions, and sensitive to image distortion through movement, or computed analysis mistakes [57]. Subsequent image treatment includes the subtraction - or segmentation - of other organs, bones and fluid from the images [58]. Inaccuracies during this process could lead to measurement errors regarding polyp size and number, although this issue has never been thoroughly investigated and quantified. For this reason, Manjunath et al. set out to methodically compare different volume-measurement techniques on available CT colonography datatsets with and without segmentation. They come to the conclusion that in all cases, the segmentation proved actually robust and generated accurate results [59].",

The reappearance of cancerous lesions close to the initial tumour site, termed isolated local recurrence (ILR), after surgery and postoperative therapy is per se bad news, as half of the cases tend to develop distant metastasis within five years [61]. Yu et al. aimed in their present study at determining further features that would prognosticate distant metastasis-free and overall survival (DMFS and OS) outcome in primary HR + patients with ILR. The authors compare the primary tumour characteristics, the histological consistency between the primary and recurrent tumours, as well as the surgical and postoperative treatments, and correlate them with the patients\u2019 outcome. They identify 29 months as the most appropriate cut-off for time to ILR to reflect survival. Moreover, primary tumour size and grading are confirmed to be predictors for DMFS and OS. In addition, Yu and colleagues encourage further studies aiming at incorporating novel agents into hormone therapy, which remains the first choice of treatment for ILR [62].",
