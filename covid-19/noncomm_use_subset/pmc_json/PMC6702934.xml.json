They are mostly reared in desert areas of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia [1]. 94% of the world\u2019s camel populations are found in the Horn region of Africa. Dhumba comprises 25% of the world\u2019s sheep population; some well-known dhumba breeds are Afrikaner, Damara, Persian Black Head, Tswana, Pedi, Sabi, Karakul, Awassi, Balkhi, etc [2]. Camel and dhumba are not usual animals for Bangladesh. But these species are of high economic value during religious festival in our country. Only one established camel farm is found in Bangladesh, which excels in camel farming as well as dhumba farming [3]. The farm was established with six imported camel from India in 2006. Since then, the farmer was able to do successful breeding of camel and the number of animal is increasing.",

Public health is in danger because of zoonotic parasites. Fat-tailed sheep and camel are more resistant to disease than other domesticated livestock. But different types of parasites have been identified in dromedaries and sheep from various countries [4\u20138]. The only study on camel of Bangladesh reported gastro-intestinal (GI) parasite prevalence as 27.9%, 26.3%, and 26.2% in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively; zoonotic parasite Fasciola hepatica was detected in that study [9].

Slides were initially examined under compound light microscope in wet mounts under low magnification (10\u00d7) to trace, followed by high magnification (100\u00d7) for identification of eggs or parasites [10,11]. Eggs of particular genera and adult parasites were identified based on morphological characters (shape and shell structure) and size [10].

A previous study from Indore on slaughterhouse sheep reported higher prevalence in female [35]. Similarly, female camel was reported to be more infected than male in the study conducted by [21], although the prevalence was much higher than our study. The infection in female could be attributed to genetic predisposition and differential susceptibility due to hormonal control. During pregnancy and peri-parturient periods, female animals have a stressed and immune-suppressed condition that makes them susceptible to disease although they share similar husbandry practice with male [36].

Similarly, camel and dhumba with poor body condition are harboring more parasites than others. The immunity of animals decreased with the advancement of age and due to poor management practices [37].",

Furthermore, we studied the determinants which might be associated with a high prevalence of diverse GI parasites. This information will convey an important message to farmers and practitioners for parasite control strategies, especially the zoonotic ones. Regular use of anthelmintic and hygienic management should be implemented in farms in order to control the parasites and to prevent the transmission of zoonotic parasites from animal to farm personnel. Future studies should be implemented to identify the genus of the parasites for better control strategies.",
