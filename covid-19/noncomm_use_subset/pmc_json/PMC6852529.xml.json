            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), synonymous for infectious tracheobronchitis or \u201ckennel cough,\u201d is a disease caused by single or multiple infectious agents with a high worldwide prevalence. Apart from several viral and bacterial agents, the individual health and constitution, vaccination status and environmental influences including husbandry conditions (e.g. crowding of animals) may have an impact on the manifestation of clinical signs. Non\u2010complicated forms of typically self\u2010limiting character may be distinguished from complicated forms associated with, possibly fatal, pneumonia. A severe course of disease typically develops as a consequence of coinfections (Chalker et al. 2003, Chvala et al. 2007, Schulz et al. 2014a). However, even isolated viral infections [e.g. canine influenza virus (CIV)] may lead to clinically relevant and sometimes lethal respiratory disease (Crawford et al. 2005). Commonly recognised viral causes of CIRD are canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV\u20102) and canine distemper virus (CDV) (Ford 2012).",

In 2003, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) emerged as a cause of CIRD in a rehoming centre in the UK (Erles et al. 2003). Further studies from several countries detected CRCoV\u2010specific nucleic acid in dogs suffering from respiratory disease (Yachi & Mochizuki 2006, Decaro et al. 2007, Spiss et al. 2012, Schulz et al. 2014a, Viitanen et al. 2015).",

Subsequently, several studies from different countries detected CIV isolates in respiratory samples and concurrent anti\u2010CIV antibodies in dogs with mild respiratory signs as well as cases of fatal respiratory disease (Yoon et al. 2005, Daly et al. 2008, Payungporn et al. 2008, Song et al. 2008, Kirkland et al. 2010, Li et al. 2010, Song et al. 2013). Furthermore, isolation of human\u2010related influenza strains from dogs was successful (Lin et al. 2012). To date, at least seven influenza virus subtypes showing different ability of interspecies and intraspecies transmission have been isolated from dogs. These subtypes are mainly prevalent in the USA (H3N8), Eastern China and South Korea (e.g. H3N2), but some of them have also been reported from European countries (Sun et al. 2013, Xie et al. 2016) supporting the hypothesis that dogs may play a role in transmission and spread of influenza virus among animal species and even humans.",
