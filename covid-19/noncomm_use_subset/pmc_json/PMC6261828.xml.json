Our finding suggests that there might be PEDV\ninfected animals in non-case farms. This means that some of the non-case farms might be not susceptible farms. Discriminating between infected and susceptible farms is critical for\nimplementing control measures that prevent cross-contamination between farms. It was reported that trucks in which pigs had been transported were contaminated with PEDV [7] and that transport vehicles are a risk factor associated with the spread of PEDV [13]. Therefore, it is important to detect\nsubclinical infected animals in non-case farms. Our findings show a significant difference between not only infectious status (case/non-case farms), but also production type (FF/WF). On farms\nwhere there is frequent or continuous farrowing, the virus is maintained in successive generations of susceptible piglets. Thus, FF farms are more likely to have PEDV-positive animals than WF\nfarms.",

A passive surveillance system is currently used in Japan to detect PED status. Our\nresults showed that some non-case farms defined as farms with no pigs demonstrating PED-like clinical symptoms indeed contain subclinical PEDV-positive animals. These results indicate that the\ncurrent passive surveillance system fails to detect subclinical PEDV infection. The actual infection status in the population can be misinterpreted when subclinical infections are present.\nThese hidden subclinical animals are ultimately overlooked. Consequently, appropriate epidemiological analyses and effective control measures are not performed. While passive surveillance can\nrapidly detect symptomatic disease, the sensitivity of the surveillance system is affected by many factors, such as the presence of clinical cases, attentiveness of the animal producers, and\nperformance of the diagnostic system [4]. It is particularly difficult to detect all cases of PEDV infections by passive surveillance as some\nPEDV-infected animals appear healthy [3].",

            "text": "In Japan, PEDV infections are confirmed by histopathological diagnosis using immunofluorescence to detect the PEDV antigen and/or RT-PCR to detect the PEDV genome. However, the PEDV detection\nperiod by these methods is very short as it is limited to the acute phase only. After that, the virus is often eliminated and disappears from the infected animals [6]. In contrast, sero-surveys\u2014such as the NT used in the present study\u2014can detect antibodies against PEDV long after infection and can be useful in diagnosing both recent and\npast infections [15, 19]. The presence of infectious animals increases the risk of transmission whereas recovered\nanimals indicates that the farm may still harbor infectious individuals capable of transmitting the virus. However, sero-surveys are unable to differentiate between infectious and recovered\nNT-positive cases, as both cases are positive for specific antibodies against PEDV. NT-positive animals in this study were either infectious or completely recovered with no capacity for\ndisseminating the virus. In addition, cytopathic effect was sometimes inhibited nonspecifically by low dilution. Diagnosis of PEDV infection using NT should be considered comprehensively in\nconjunction with detection of PEDV or PEDV genome. RT-PCR would be more appropriate to accurately classify cases in regard to the presence of PEDV genome. Therefore, the monitoring system\nshould utilize sero-surveys as a screening technique to enhance detection of subclinical animals. Subsequently, non-case farms with sero-positive animals should be further examined using\nRT-PCR to confirm if infectious animals exist. However, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy must be further evaluated. And further research will be required to confirm the sensitivity and\nspecificity of NT test.",
