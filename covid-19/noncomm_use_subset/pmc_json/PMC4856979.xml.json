            "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human gamma herpesvirus that has been implicated in several lymphoproliferative diseases and is responsible for AIDS associated morbidities and mortalities (1\u20133). KSHV establishes a life-long latent infection preferentially in B-lymphocytes, where the genome is maintained as a multi-copy, chromatinized episome tethered to the host chromosome through the interaction of the viral protein, Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA) (4\u20137). To stably maintain the latent infection in proliferating B cells, the KSHV genome needs to be replicated and faithfully segregated during each cellular division. The terminal repeat (TR) region of KSHV contains a primary origin of latent DNA replication of KSHV and is critical for the stable maintenance of the viral episome in proliferating cells (8\u201310). Apart from LANA, the KSHV TR associates with several components of the cellular replication machinery, including origin recognition complexes (ORCs), mini chromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs), Topoisomerase II\u03b2 (TOPOII\u03b2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (11\u201314). Recruitment of TOPOII\u03b2 by LANA is essential for the initiation of replication in the TRs and the maintenance of the KSHV episome (13). Recent studies showed that TR-mediated DNA replication is coupled with DNA recombination and the depletion of cellular replication fork protection factors, such as Timeless and Tipin, reduce the genome copies of latently persisting KSHV (15) confirming an important role of replication fork progression in viral DNA replication.",

            "text": "Currently, there are not many effective methods available for the treatment of KSHV infection (16,17). At present, anti-herpesvirus therapies are mostly aimed to selectively inhibit the lytic DNA replication of the virus (16,18). Additionally, the available antiviral agents used in KSHV viral infections are those that are clinically approved for the general treatment of herpesvirus infections, such as ganciclovir (GCV), acyclovir (ACV), or structurally similar penciclovir (PCV) and brivudin (BVDU). These drugs are nucleoside analogs that require active lytic replication of virus to be effective. For this reason, although antiretroviral therapy reduces the symptoms of the KSHV during latency, they do not reduce copies of latently persisting KSHV genomes from the infected cells (19,20). Since KSHV, like other herpesviruses, establishes life-long latent infection by escaping the host's immune surveillance system, it is not yet possible to eliminate the virus from the infected individual (17,21\u201323). Hence, disrupting KSHV latency will be a crucial step in the elimination of the virus from the infected host cells (21).",

            "text": "One of the most unique aspects of the KSHV genomic sequence is the TR region, which contains a high concentration of guanine residues. Regions of DNA or RNA that have a high guanine content, such as the eukaryotic telomeric DNA, have been shown to form secondary structures called G-quadruplexes (24\u201327). The formation of G-quadruplexes on nucleic acid sequences (DNA or RNA) begins by the association of four guanine residues to form a G-quartet. Each guanine residue interacts with the other through two hydrogen bonds and the presence of a central monovalent cation (Na+ or K+) increases the stability of the G-quartet. The G-quartets thus formed have a high propensity to stack resulting in the formation of stable G-quadruplex structures (28\u201330). Formation of G-quadruplex structures may lead to the stalling of replication forks due to slippage of the polymerases (31). Formation of G-quadruplex structures on the mRNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded nuclear antigen 1, EBNA1 has been shown to be important in the regulation of viral mRNA translation and thus altering immune evasion (32).",

            "text": "The TR region of the KSHV has multiple reiterated copies of an 801 bp GC-rich sequence. Analyzing the TR sequence for its ability to form G-quadruplex structures using Quadruplex forming G-Rich Sequences (QGRS, http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/QGRS/analyze.php analyzer) revealed that each copy of the TR, which together constitute the TR region, has 12 potential G-quadruplex forming sites in the top strand (Strand 1) (Figure 1A, sequence highlighted in yellow). Since the G-quadruplexes are formed on a single strand of nucleic acids, we also analyzed the bottom strand of the TR (strand 2), which revealed 16 potential G-quadruplex forming sites. Lists of QGRS sites and their G-scores on the top and bottom strands of the TR are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The size of the linear KSHV genome is \u223c165 kb with the TR region being a significant part of the genome; we wanted to determine the size of the TR region for an estimation of the total number of G-quadruplexes. To this end, we determined the size of the TR region by digesting the genome with restriction enzymes BamHI or EcoRI, which flank the TR region. The sizes of the bands hybridizing with TR probe, which detects the TR region, were \u223c30 kb and 32 kb with BamHI and EcoRI, respectively (Figure 1B and C). Based on the nucleotide sequence and the locations of these restriction enzymes sites, 30 kb band with EcoRI and 32 kb band with BamHI will be obtained if there were 32 copies of the TRs thus confirming the TR copies to be \u223c32. Each of the 32 TR copies has 12 (top strand) and 16 (bottom strand) potential G-quadruplex forming sites, leading to 384 and 512 potential G-quadruplex forming sites in the top and bottom strand, respectively. In comparison, only 759 and 908 potential G-quadruplex forming sites were found in the top and bottom strand of the rest of the genome (\u223c140 kb), which is more than 5 times larger than the TR region (801 bp of 32 copies = 25.6 kb), thus making the TR a possible target for therapeutic intervention. A closer look at the G-score (propensity of a sequence to fold into 4 tetrad stacked to form a stable G-quadruplex) revealed one site in the top (Figure 1A, marked red) and one in the bottom strand (Figure 1A, marked green) of the TR with a very high G score. Analysis of the G score of the rest of sites of the viral genome showed only few sites with comparable G scores (Figure 1A, PmeI digested schematic) to the TR. G-quadruplex sites in the top strand (marked in red) are in the coding region of vIRF-2 (G score 59), between kaposin (DR6) and oriLyt-R (G score 62) and between oriLyt-L and K5 9 (G score 63). The G-quadruplex sites in the bottom strand (marked in green) are in between v-IRF2 and v-IRF3 (G score 57) and in the oriLyt-L region (G score 60) (Figure 1A, PmeI schematic). The G-quadruplexes in the rest of the genome may have other implications but the cumulative effect of the G-quadruplex sites of the TR region is likely to be important in regulating replication and transcriptional activities.",

CD is a highly sensitive assay to determine the conformational states of quadruplex structures formed in nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) (53). Oligonucleotides with a tract of guanine residues form parallel quadruplexes with all guanosine glycosidic angles making a characteristic very large positive band at 260 nm determined by CD spectra (53). Both the oligonucleotides of TR (S-TR63 and AS-TR62) formed characteristic peaks of parallel conformation of G-quadruplexes (Figure 2A). A previously characterized oligonucleotide of HSV-1, gp054d, also showed a similar pattern confirming the G-quadruplex conformation in the TR oligonucleotides (42). A negative control where the G-tract was abolished (G score 0) by scrambling the sequence did not show the characteristic peak. Interestingly, addition of a physiological concentration of K+, which increases the stability of the quadruplxes, increased the peaks of AS-TR62 and HSV-1 gp054d, but not much for S-TR63 (Figure 2B). This confirmed that these QGRS oligonucleotidess of TR displays G-quadruplex conformation even in the absence of K+ but the stability could be enhanced with physiological concentrations of K+.",

Both the oligonucleotides of TR, S-TR63 and AS-TR62 (Figure 2C lane 3 and 4, green asterisk) ran markedly faster than their 22-bp long control oligonucleotide (Figure 2C, lane 1, red asterisk) due to their folding into G-quadruplex as compared to unfolded linear control oligonucleotide. Although AS-TR62 is slightly longer (26 bp) compared to S-TR62 (22 bp), they both ran with almost similar mobility confirming their ability to fold into a G-quadruplex. Another control, a short oligonucleotide (11 bp) was used to determine the mobilities of these QGRS oligonucleotides (Figure 2C lane 1). As a positive control of G-quadruplex formation, a previously characterized QGRS oligonucleotide of HSV-1, gp054d (42), was analyzed alongside the TR QGRS oligonucleotides (Figure 2C lane 5). The similar mobilities observed between the positive control oligonucleotide and the TR oligonucleotides confirmed that these TR oligonucleotides fold into G-quadruplexes.

Addition of the same concentration of non-complementary oligonucleotides (nc oligonucleotide 1,2 \u2013 unable to bind to the S-TR63 oligonucleotide), did not disrupt the G-quadruplex formation (Figure 2D, lane 5, green asterisk). Lane 1 and 2 had the control oligonucleotides for comparing the mobilities. Similarly, the AS-TR62 QGRS oligonucleotide was also analyzed for G-quadruplex formation in the presence of excess molar ratios of the two complementary oligonucleotides (S-1 and S-2). Mobility of AS-TR62 oligonucleotide was altered by specific complementary oligonucleotides due to their binding to the target sequence (Figure 2E, lane 4), however, non-complementary oligonucleotides (nc oligonucleotide 1, 2) were unable to alter the G-quadruplex formation and thereby the mobility (Figure 2E, compare lane 3 and 5, green asterisks).

A schematic of the KSHV genome linearized with PmeI is shown in Figure 3A. Consistent with our previous results (47), the current data showed that in the untreated BCBL-1 cells, replication initiates at multiple sites along the KSHV genome and that replication proceeds bi-directionally (Figure 3B). Detection of the replication initiation sites on the dually labeled molecules (IdU and CldU, red and green, respectively) showed replication initiation sites throughout the genome indicated by black arrows (Figure 3C). However, further quantification of the distribution of origins by the percentage of IdU incorporation indicated that, in the untreated BCBL-1 cells, there is a slight preference in TR region for replication initiation in the TR region (Figure 3D, demarcated by blue dotted lines).",

Episomal replication was carried out by 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 travelling replication forks and replication initiation occurred at multiple sites throughout the KSHV genome. BCBL-1 cells treated with 10 \u03bcM TMPyP4 (Figure 3E) or 10 \u03bcM PhenDC3 (Figure 3H) showed replication initiation throughout the KSHV genome with initiation sites indicated by the schematics of PmeI linearized replicated viral genomes (Figure 3F and I). The locations of replication initiations are marked by black arrows, which are present at multiple sites throughout the viral genome (Figure 3F and I). Interestingly, 10 \u03bcM TMPyP4 treatment did not show any preferential usage of TR origins compared to the untreated cells (Figure 3; compare panel D with G, areas demarcated by blue lines). Importantly, treatment with 10 \u03bcM PhenDC3 showed initiation throughout the genome but had a slight preference for the TR region for replication initiation (Figure 3H; area demarcated by blue lines).",

Similar to cells treated with 10 \u03bcM PhenDC3 (Figure 3H), the 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 treated cells displayed a slight preference for replication initiation in the TR (Figure 4F, bars demarcated between the blue lines). To determine the effect of PhenDC3 on the global replication of the BCBL-1 cellular DNA, the cells were pulsed with EdU for 60 min in the presence of 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 and the incorporation of EdU was measured by fluorescence. The results showed that the incorporation of EdU was significantly decreased in cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3, as compared to DMSO treated control cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Surprisingly, the global replication inhibition observed in the presence of 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 did not significantly alter the replication profile of the KSHV episomes.",

Only two replications forks (single origin) were necessary to replicate nearly 90% of each KSHV genome (Figure 5A). To determine whether the G-quadruplex stabilizing drugs subject the BCBL-1 cells to replicative stress, which can be measured by increased dormant origin firing, we calculated the percent increase in initiation events for each the untreated and G-quadruplex stabilizing drug treated cells.. In the untreated BCBL-1 cells, only 15% of KSHV activated more than origin (Figure 5B; blue bar). Consistent with our fork quantification (Figure 5A), the number of origins activated was directly proportional to the concentration of the drug, with cells treated with the higher concentration of the G4 stabilizer activating more origins per KSHV genome. Treatment with both 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 elicited a significant increase in the observed replication initiation events (Figure 5C; black and red bars). The 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 treatment had the most profound influence on dormant origin activation, with a near 30% increase in observed initiation events (Figure 5C; red bar). Treatment with 10 \u03bcM TMPyP4 (Figure 5C; green bar) did cause an increase in the dormant origin firing, however, the data were not significantly different as compared to the untreated cells. These results clearly indicate that the stress response generated in the presence of the G4 stabilizers leads to the activation of dormant origins that are other wise inactive in the untreated BCBL-1 cells. Analysis of these molecules for initiation of replication with different concentrations of G-quadruplex stabilizers showed an exponential increase in the percentage of replication initiation events (Figure 5C).",

Since replication forks have been shown to pause at secondary structures (59\u201361), we asked whether stabilizing the G-quadruplex with PhenDC3 would perturb replication by stalling the replication machinery. Replication pausing can be visualized as clusters of replication forks accumulating at specific regions of the genome and can be quantified by dividing the genome into 10 kb intervals and calculating the number of forks present in each 10 kb interval, along the length of the genome, in both the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directions. In untreated cells, while some replication pausing was observed in the TR region, cells treated with 10 \u03bcM PhenDC3 showed a moderate increase in pausing in both directions, as compared to the untreated cells (Figure 5D). However, treatment with 10 \u03bcM TMPyP4 led to replication pausing in and around the TR region, with a notable bi-directional pausing of forks moving out of the TR region (Figure 5D). When the dosage was increased to 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3, more than 25% of the replication forks paused in both the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directions (Figure 5E). Interestingly, replication forks seem to stall at or near the outer boundary of the repeats, progressing out of the TR region. These results collectively show that treatment with G-quadruplex stabilizers leads to replication fork stalling at the terminal repeats of KSHV, perhaps leading to the generation of a stress response that causes the cell to activate dormant replication origins.",

To this end, we treated the latently infected BCBL-1 cells with G-quadruplex stabilizing compound, PhenDC3 and measured the latent DNA replication as well as the persistence of the viral genome. BCBL-1 cells were treated with two different concentrations of G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds (10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3), used in SMARD assays. In order to determine the persistence of latent genome copies, we had to treat the BCBL-1 cells with the G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds through multiple cell divisions. To determine the effect of PhenDC3 on the cell cycle progression, we performed a cell cycle analysis on BCBL-1 cells treated with PhenDC3, by PI staining. Interestingly, our data showed that BCBL-1 cells treated with PhenDC3 indeed accumulated cells in late S and G2 phase of the cell cycle in a dose dependent manner (Figure 6A), confirming that these compounds blocked the cell cycle progression. To further confirm whether PhenDC3 treatment reduces the overall cell growth, we performed a cell proliferation assay using the CFSE cell proliferation Kit (see Methods). Consistent with the cell cycle data, CFSE analysis showed that BCBL-1 cells treated with PhenDC3 had a slower cell proliferation rate (Figure 6C) as compared to the DMSO treated cells (Figure 6B). Encouraged by these findings, that PhenDC3 can induce replication pausing and reduce cell growth, we decided to analyze the effect of PhenDC3 on the maintenance of KSHV genome in latently infected cells. The persistence of KSHV episomes in BCBL-1 cells was measured after treatment with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 or DMSO over a period of 4 days at 24-h intervals. At the end of 4 days, \u223c2 million cells were collected from each condition to analyze the genome copies by qRT PCR using oligonucleotides specific for KSHV ORF73 along with ORF73 standards. Oligonucleotides specific for GAPDH served as the internal house keeping control to normalize fold change of KSHV genome copies. Our data show that BCBL-1 cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 had \u223c60% fewer (relative KSHV genome copies to \u223c0.4) KSHV genomes compared to the DMSO treated cells after 4 days of treatment (Figure 6D). KSHV genome copies remained unaltered in DMSO treated cells as expected (Figure 6D, KSHV genome panel). Analysis of the relative copies of GAPDH from day 0 showed a slight reduction in GAPDH suggesting a slight decrease in cell number with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 treatment (Figure 6D, GAPDH panel). Interestingly, our MTT assay (see Methods), to check the cell viability of BCBL-1 cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 showed less reduction in cell growth as compared to the control (Figure 6E), indicating a specific reduction in KSHV genome copies with limited cytotoxic effect on overall cellular proliferation.",

To address this, we asked whether the withdrawal of drug from the PhenDC3 treated cells, which now had reduced viral episomes, would reestablish viral genome copies. The BCBL-1 cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 for 1\u20134 days were cultured in drug-free (PhenDC3-free) medium for 10 days and the KSHV genome copies were monitored at day 2, day 5 and day 10 during their growth in drug-free medium. The data show that cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 for 1 or 2 days regained the viral genome copies similar to untreated cells after a 10-day recovery, in drug free medium (Figure 7A, blue and red lines). However, the cells treated for 3 and 4 days with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 were unable to completely regain their viral genome copies (relative copies were 0.7 as compared to 1 in untreated cells), suggesting the elimination of viral episomes from these cells (Figure 7A, green and purple lines). A MTT cell proliferation assay carried out on the cells recovered for 5 and 10 days showed improved cellular proliferation (Figure 7B). These data suggest that PhenDC3 specifically reduces KSHV genome copies with minimal effect on overall cell growth and proliferation.",

The positions of the circular episomes (upper band) and the linear (lower band) forms of the KSHV genome are clearly demarcated. Similar amounts of PhenDC3 treated and untreated cells were also subjected to alpha satellite DNA detection, to ensure that equal numbers of cells were taken for the Gardella assay (Figure 8C).

However, the tracts of guanine residues in high GC content DNA have the tendency to form secondary structures including G-quadruplexes. The G-quadruplexes have been shown in vitro to stall the progression of transcription and DNA replication machineries and an important example of this is the retardation of the replication of telomeric sequences (63). In further support for this idea, sequence analysis of the TR region revealed about 896 potential QGRS in both the strands of TR sequence. Although all these sites could fold into G-quadruplex structures, we chose only a few sites, with a high G-score, for biophysical and biochemical analysis to determine their conformation. Not surprisingly, both the oligonucleotides of TR with QGRS assembled into a G-quadruplex conformation demonstrated by the CD spectrometry and gel mobility shift assays. Importantly, deleting the G tract of the TR's QGRS oligonucleotide abolished the G-quadruplex conformation confirming that the TR sequence can persist in G-quadruplex form and intervention to stabilize these structures can modulate activities dependent on TR. Stabilization of the G-quadruplex conformations in other parts of the viral genome may also occur, however, the number of such sites in the rest of the genome are limited, therefore the overall affect may not be as profound. However, this does not rule out their role in other functions of viral life cycle. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effect of G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds on the latent replication of KSHV and determined the usefulness of G-quadruplex-stabilizing compounds as inhibitors of KSHV latent replication.",

The absence of a striking difference in the replication profiles of G-quadruplex stabilizer treated and untreated BCBL-1 cells, although perplexing at first, led us to believe in a more subtle effect of the drug. This was ascertained by quantitating the individual parameters of replication such as replication initiation and replication fork pausing.",

These excess origins, called dormant/latent origins, do not fire during unperturbed replication (56). Upon replicative stress, the slowing down of the replication forks and/or impediments to the replication fork machinery result in the activation of these additional dormant origins in order to efficiently complete replication before the cell transitions to G2/M phase. Our data show that treatment with the G-quadruplex stabilizing compound PhenDC3 elicits a stress response and activates higher numbers of replication forks per KSHV genome in a dose dependent manner. A higher concentration of PhenDC3 appears to exacerbate the replication stress on the KSHV genome leading to an increase in the number of replication forks along the entire genome. In agreement with our fork quantification (Figure 5A and B), the extent of replicative stress experienced by the KSHV episomes in response to PhenDC3 is further demonstrated by the activation of dormant replication origins in a dosage dependent manner (Figure 5C).",

Previous studies have shown that the replication machinery pauses at secondary structures (59\u201361), and this could compromise replication by resulting in fork collapse. We observed that treatment with PhenDC3 and TMPyP4, led to bi-directional replication fork pausing at the TR (Figure 5D and E). Importantly, since PhenDC3 has been shown to specifically bind to the G-quadruplex DNA (65), we propose that the binding of these G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds, potentially stabilizes the G quadruplex structures, thereby leading to the obstruction of the movement of replication forks in the TR. Interestingly, the pausing appears to occur at or near the outer boundary of the TR region, progressing outward of the TR region. These data strongly suggest that treatment with PhenDC3 leads to the perturbation of KSHV replication by stalling the bi-directional progress of the replication machinery, across the TR. The replication pausing and initiation data obtained from BCBL-1 cells treated with TMPyP4 was not statistically significant (Figure 5B and C). This could possibly be attributed to the recent reports that suggest that TMPyP4 is non-selective toward G-quadruplex structures (66).",

More importantly, the KSHV genome copy number remained low even upon withdrawal of the PhenDC3 compound and the continued growth of the cells in drug-free medium. Our data conclusively demonstrates that treatment with PhenDC3 appears to have reduced the viral genome copies without the need for the continuous administration of drug. Although the treatment with PhenDC3 resulted in some accumulation of cells in late S and G2 phase of the cell cycle, there was minimal cytotoxic effect suggesting that these G-quadruplex stabilizers have possibly exhibited a transient S-phase arrest or cell cycle slow down. This suggests the potential importance of G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds as pharmacological inhibitors of KSHV latent DNA replication and maintenance.",

We found that BCBL-1 cells treated with 20 \u03bcM PhenDC3 indeed show a significant reduction in transient replication of TR containing plasmids. These data further substantiated and strengthened our findings that, PhenDC3 could cause pausing or stalling of the bi-directional progress of the replication machinery at or near the outer boundary of the terminal repeats. These data also suggest that treatment with PhenDC3 leads to a reduction in the replication of KSHV genome. In complete agreement with these findings, our Gardella gel electrophoresis assay further demonstrated a significant reduction in both circular and linear DNA copies of the KSHV genome compared to DMSO treated, control cells. Taken together, our data suggest that PhenDC3 stabilizes the G-quadruplexes that could potentially form in the GC-rich TRs region, thereby blocking the progression of replication forks. This likely leads to the reduction in viral genome replication, which ultimately affects the maintenance of the KSHV episomes in the infected cells. Previous studies have determined the roles of G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds on viral gene expression (31), but this is the first report to our knowledge that G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds stalled the progression of replication forks of the viral episomes inhibiting KSHV latency, thus identifying a potential target for therapeutically blocking KSHV-associated malignancies.",
