Among cranial nerve palsies in GBS, facial nerve palsy is the most common affecting around half of the cases.2,3 Facial palsy in GBS is usually bilateral and less frequently unilateral in adults.4 In children, cranial nerve involvement is less common than in adults.5 As in adults, facial palsy is most commonly bilateral. We are only able to find few reports of unilateral facial palsy in children.3,6\u201310 We describe a child with GBS variant who had unilateral peripheral facial palsy and dysphagia.",

His muscle strength was 4/5 in upper and 3/5 in lower extremities and had generalized hypotonia. The position sensation was decreased and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent. He was able to sit on the side of the bed and stand while locking his knees, but he was unable to walk or raise the arms above the shoulder. The finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests showed dysmetria, and appendicular ataxia was present in all four limbs. His condition deteriorated with a decline in respiratory effort and inability to handle secretions. He was noted to have low tone voice with nasal intonation, dysphagia with drooling, and weak cough indicating bulbar palsy. He was given non-invasive ventilation to prevent worsening of his acute respiratory failure.",

Cranial nerve enhancement is reported in children with GBS variants such as Miller Fisher syndrome16 and polyneuritis cranialis21 as well as other variants.18 In our patient, enhancement of the seventh cranial nerve was not seen. Zuccoli et al.16 made the similar interesting observation that in spite of the common clinical involvement of the facial nerve, facial nerve enhancement is uncommon. Cranial nerve enhancement of cranial nerve X and XI was seen in our patient. The enhancement with gadolinium suggests inflammatory infiltrate on nerve sheaths and breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier because of inflammation.22 Electrodiagnostic studies were not performed in our patient. We believe that it was not necessary as neuroimaging was diagnostic of AIDP. Electrodiagnostic studies are frequently challenging and unobtainable in children.",

            "text": "There are several theories about the cause of unilateral facial palsy in GBS. Facial palsy in childhood onset GBS may be caused by neural compression in narrow internal acoustic canal and may be aggravated by facial nerve edema and hemorrhage caused by hypertension.9 Similarly, it can be caused by antibody-mediated demyelination,23 which is the possible explanation in our patient. Whether the cases of facial nerve palsy reported in children with GBS were caused by severe hypertension or were the first manifestation of the polyneuropathy remains uncertain. A review of past literature showed controversy regarding treatment of GBS with steroid.24,25 Some suggest that GBS with peripheral facial palsy may require glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoid therapy must be started early after onset of symptoms to shorten the time of recovery.26\u201329 Facial palsy may resolve in 2 weeks with IVIG therapy.10",

Bulbar palsy indicates impending respiratory paralysis; therefore, respiratory support may be required.30,32. In our present patient, IVIG resulted in rapid improvement of vocalization and swallowing ability. It is believed that IVIG reduces inflammation and modifies autoimmunity.",
