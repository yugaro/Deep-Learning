During Year 6, students pursue clerkships in specific clinical disciplines of interest at the SMC as well as at two other affiliated hospitals: Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (KSH) located in the city of Seoul and Samsung Changwon Hospital located in the city of Changwon.

The classrooms are also isolated from the clinical wards due to their locations on different floors. In order to prevent any potential transmission of MERS, the school had students follow a set of precautions consistent with advice from the public health authorities. Precautions included (1) repeated handwashing and sanitizing, (2) taking daily temperature, and (3) using masks. The school provided sanitizers and masks to students in every class. In addition, the school set up a monitoring team including a group of administrative staff. The staff took student temperatures two times a day and kept track of their health statuses. Through various channels, including text messages, emails, and online and offline bulletin boards, students were reminded of precautions and informed of a hotline number to call in case they displayed some of the initial symptoms of MERS such as high fever and cough.",

In response, the SMC was partially closed and stopped admitting outpatients. Although the school area was isolated from the clinical wards, several risk factors of student infection were recognized. First, students shared some pathways with HCP at the SMC. An increasing number of faculty members were suspected to have contacted patients with MERS and were isolated at home. Because many classes were taught in small group-based learning formats such as problem-based learning, students had closer contact with instructors and peer students than they would in large lecture classes. In addition, given the fact that many medical students spend a great amount of time and share living spaces (e.g., living in a dormitory) with their peers, infection of one student could readily spread to multiple students. With continuous assessment of all these risk factors, the school leadership admitted an imperative need to completely restrict student access to the hospital, which amounted to closure of the school.",

In order to minimize such loss for the students, the emergency committee declared the school closure period (4 weeks) to be the summer break and to continue the remaining courses after the break. This strategy was particularly practical because the regular summer break at SKKUSOM was scheduled to begin only 3 weeks ahead after the MERS outbreak occurred. By moving up the summer break, although interruption in the regular curriculum was inevitable, the courses could still be carried out as originally planned, and most class times were retained.",

In addition, it was expected that the SMC would have difficulty offering ordinary clerkships because HCP were quarantined and a limited number of patients were hospitalized due to the partial closure of the hospital. Given these circumstances, the committee considered providing the core clerkship program in another teaching hospital of our medical school, KSH, which had no reported cases of MERS. KSH is a tertiary hospital that has 33 clinical divisions and five speciality centers. Normally, students perform clinical clerkships at KSH in Year 6 for further training in specific disciplines of interest.",

For example, the school provided sample rubrics for student evaluation during the clerkships so that the faculty members can develop their own assessment tool. With full cooperation of KSH faculty, the school was able to minimize the loss of student clinical-practice hours, and students successfully continued their core clerkships after returning from their break.",

Using a previously-installed remote lecturing system linking the hospital and the main campus, instructors delivered lectures in the hospital classroom while students took classes at the main campus. The lectures were video-recorded, and students simultaneously watched the recorded lectures on a screen. With this synchronous technology, the remote lecturing system allowed instructors and students to be as interactive as if they were in the same classroom. In a similar way, we arranged PBL tutorials using a web-based video conferencing tool (i.e., Skype). Tutorial groups of students gathered at the main campus and tutors joined the groups from the hospital via Skype. With such technology, students and tutors were connected for the entire course of the tutorial, and successfully executed the two scheduled tutorials.",

When SARS struck Hong Kong and Toronto, suspension of clinical teaching was one of the early interventions of the local medical schools to protect their students [7,8]. Such decisions can be challenging, especially when a disease is unprecedented, because the impact of the disease might not be recognized. When the risk of infection is under complete control, clinical clerkships may offer a great learning opportunity for students [9]. However, when an infectious disease is relatively new, it is difficult to gauge risk and identify the routes of transmission. We faced a similar situation in that the first patient identified with MERS at the SMC was the very first case in South Korea, and no infection control guidelines had yet been formulated by the government or the public health authorities. Even if the course of infection is identified, there is always a possibility of unwitting contact with infected patients. Thus, in order to prevent possible transmission of an evolving infection to students, immediate cessation of clerkship rotations at teaching hospitals is recommended at the onset of infection outbreaks.",

The decision-making process needs to be rational and flexible, examining various factors such as subsequent risk of student exposure to infection, schedules of the remaining classes, and the logistical possibilities of closure of a school [12]. In the MERS outbreak, although suspending the clinical clerkships, the school kept offering nonclinical teaching sessions such as classroom-based lectures to minimize the disruption of the regular curriculum. However, with the growing number of hospital-acquired infections, the school leadership acknowledged that students were endangered even outside the patient-care environment. Considering the need to balance student safety and continuity in medical education, the school declared an early summer break and closed the school temporarily.",

With further advanced information and communication technology, instructors can now deliver live, interactive lessons, not recorded lectures, to students at remote sites. SKKUSOM used a remote lecturing system that linked classrooms in the hospital with those at the main campus.

One of the advantages of web-based tools is that the individual students can take a class from home as long as they are connected to the Internet. The use of such tools can substantially reduce the possibility of cross-infection while continuing education for medical students during outbreaks of infectious disease. Medical schools may consider preparing to offer web-based courses in similar outbreaks that prohibit face-to-face meeting of individuals. This preparation will include not only the purchase of web-based tools, but also overcoming resistance from faculty and providing student and faculty training on use of the tools.",

By involving administrative staff as core members of the emergency committee, the administrative team was able to acquire solid understanding of the circumstances and provide full support in addressing the unusual situation. Similarly, direct and open communication with the KSH faculty was the key to promoting their willingness to provide a substitute program for the regular clerkship. Medical schools generally have more than one affiliated hospital where students take clerkships, and they are responsible for monitoring the clerkship schedules at each hospital and maintaining contact with hospital personnel in charge of student education. With well-established channels of communication with teaching hospitals, medical schools can acquire adequate cooperation of the hospitals with rapid curriculum changes in an emergency situation.",
