These activities are typically metabolic biomarkers such as ATP and mitochondrial reductase potential, but can include homeostatic \u201chousekeeping\u201d enzyme activities. The underlying assay premise is that these activities are directly proportional to viable cell number after a treatment period. During relatively short incubation periods (8 hr or less), a reduction or complete cessation of these biomarker activities is strongly indicative of overt cytotoxicity by catastrophic membrane damage (i.e. primary necrosis) [11]. A reduction in biomarker activity compared to control in longer incubations indicates either a reduction in normal cellular division rate (cell-cycle arrest) or cell death by programmed elimination mechanisms such as apoptosis [12, 13]. Because viability assays measure the relative number of cells remaining after treatment, they offer significant utility even during long compound-contact periods (72 hr).",

The assay utilizes the cell-permeant protease substrate glycyl-phenylalanyl-amino-fluorocoumerin (GF-AFC) that is delivered to wells in a neutral buffer. The substrate, which lacks an amino-terminal blocking moiety (i.e. Boc, Ac, or Cbz), can be processed by aminopeptidase(s) within the cytoplasm.

These methods rely on an impermeant DNA intercalating dye which labels cells with damaged membranes and a permeable dye that is sequestered inside viable cells after esterase cleavage of a labeling group. Variations of these traditional chemistries are rarely employed where total fluorescence from assay wells is measured, because of poor sensitivity from simple stoichiometric dye binding events in the non-viable cell population and requisite washes required for removal of unbound dye and serum-derived esterases. Stable, non-viable cell esterase activity is particularly problematic for assay utility as it greatly impacts assay background values and constricts signal windows.",

First, it is possible to conduct immediate confirmation testing of apparent cytotoxic compounds in the same well by leveraging the statistical power of orthogonal detection of viability (viable cell aminopeptidase, dead cell protease and ATP biomarkers). The economy of this consolidated testing is noteworthy in terms of compound usage, culture set up, and operator man-hours. Second, the mechanism of cell death can often be elucidated when combined with caspase detection reagents, allowing for partial characterization of a compound\u2019s potential. It should be noted however, that caspase activity can be transient and immeasurable in long-term experiments due to the kinetics of apoptosis and caspase biomarker decay. Therefore, caspase-negative data sets should be rescreened at multiple compound exposure periods. This type of characterization of pathway dependent cytotoxicity is useful for continued annotation of a library, because compounds causing necrotic profiles at micromolar concentrations are rarely therapeutically useful and may offer unacceptable cytotoxic risk. And third, viability and cytotoxicity can be used to normalize luminescent data from other assays (Fig. 7). Single parameter genetic reporter responses are susceptible to experimental variation due to differential transfection efficiencies, cell number delivered to the well (clumping) or to cytotoxicity caused by the test compound [55]. Viability and cytotoxicity data can therefore help reconcile aberrant data points or explain decreases in genetic reporter signals due to cell death.",

In this method, viability is measured first by the addition of the GF-AFC reagent followed by the addition of the luminogenic dead cell reagent chemistry. The use of disparate detection platform methodologies is known to greatly reduce the statistical potential for assay interferences associated with reporter molecules [60]. Therefore this combination of chemistries is favored if a library is uncharacterized with regard to the relative abundance of luminogenic inhibitors or which may cause fluorescence interference. Unlike the fluorescence/fluorescence multiplex, fewer convenient triplex options exist. For example, the chemistry can be configured with a fluorogenic caspase activation chemistry (R110 fluorophore) to deliver data relating to possible induction of apoptosis (Fig. 7A) [61, 62]. Again, negative caspase induction results should be verified by rescreening to verify necrotic response profiles.",

Another remarkable feature of luminogenic assays is the persistent and stable glow-type signal produced after reagent addition (Fig. 8). This attribute can be harnessed to produce both viability and cytotoxicity values from the same well. In this method, the non-lytic, luminogenic cytotoxicity assay chemistry is first delivered to the assay well and cytotoxicity measured. Next, a lytic agent is added to assay wells to artificially release the remaining dead cell protease from viable cells. The net signal derived after complete lysis reflects the contribution of all the cells in the assay well. Because the luminescent signal is additive and proportional, the viable cell population can be indirectly determined by subtracting the cytotoxic values from the total values. This method is particularly useful for determining cytotoxicity in long incubation protocols where dead cell biomarker activity may not fully reflect actual cytotoxicity. One caveat of this method is that both viability and cytotoxicity measurements utilize the same biomarker and are subject to the same interferences.",
