On the basis of GLOBOCAN, about 17.5 million cancer cases were detected and 8.7 million deaths occurred in 2015 worldwide.1 In the USA, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths were projected to occur in 2017.2 Although these disturbing numbers indicate that we have not won the \u201cwar on cancer\u201d, recently developed anticancer drugs with higher inhibitory activity and strong selectivity by structural modifications of natural products (such as etoposide, teniposide, vindesine and vinorelbine, which were derived from vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxin) have raised hopes for cancer patients to survive.3 Today, we use a lot of drugs indirectly or directly derived from natural products, and structural modification of natural products with pharmacological activity to obtain anticancer drugs with high inhibitory activities and selectivity has become a popular research direction.3\u20135\nFructus Ligustri Lucidi, a natural product, is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum Ait. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Fructus Ligustri Lucidi was discovered and used for the very early treatment of various diseases.6 Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound, has been isolated from Fructus Ligustri Lucidi.7 Researchers showed a strong interest in the investigation of OA because of its extensive biological activities, such as antivirus,8 antitumor,9,10 anti-inflammatory11 and other pharmacological activities. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a natural product extracted from Glycyrrhiza uralensis.12 GA and OA are similar in structure, and both are pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds (Figure 1). GA also has antitumor,13,14 anti-inflammatory,15,16 antiviral,17,18 antiallergic19 and antiulcer activities.20 Some studies have found that OA and GA have a broad inhibitory effect on the growth of many tumor cell lines in vitro by inducing tumor cell autophagy and apoptosis, blocking the cell cycle and inhibiting multidrug resistance of tumors.21\u201325 To further explore the physiological activities of OA and GA, researchers performed a large number of structural modifications and studies of biological activities on these two natural products.26\u201330",

Chu et al reported the first preparation of ligustrazine-oleanolic acid and then the introduction of amino acid fragments to obtain new compounds with high inhibitory activities.31 Li et al reported that first the preparation of GA esters and then the introduction of 3-(1H-benzo[d] imidazol-2-yl)propanoic acid fragments can greatly improve the anticancer activity, as compared with GA itself.32 In this research, we use the method of combination to prepare OA and GA esters to increase their lipophilicity and introduce organic acid groups to increase their polarity. We selected 10 kinds of organic acids (nicotinic acid,33 indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indolebutyric acid, cinnamic acid,34 isonicotinic acid, salicylic acid,35 acetyl 4-hydroxycinnamic acid,36 acetylsalicylic acid, acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) with certain biological activity into the 3-OH position of the OA ester and GA ester, and finally synthesized 20 new OA and GA derivatives, of which 18 new compounds were the target products. We used five cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa and Hep-G2) to determine the antitumor activity and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) as a control.",

Organic acids (R1OH) were coupled with the 3-OH position of 2a to obtain esters 3a\u2013e using the DMAP/EDCI system. Nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid was dissolved in SOCl2, and triethylamine and 2a were added to obtain 3f\u2013g. The synthesis of GA derivatives 3h\u2013n is described in Scheme 2. Treatment of GA with benzyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 gives the GA ester 2b. The 3-OH position of 2b reacts with organic acids (R2OH) in the EDCI/DMAP system to form compounds 3h\u2013l. Treatment of nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid with SOCl2 was followed by the addition of triethylamine and 2b as the acid-binding agent, using the esterification procedure to obtain the compounds 3m,n. Compounds 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b were prepared as shown in Schemes 3 and 4. In some studies, it has been reported that the esters of acetylsalicylic acid easily undergo ester exchange reactions.21\u201325,39 Thus, when acetylsalicylic acid was reacted with 2a,b in the EDCI/DMAP system, we did not obtain 4a,b, but rather 5a,b, and we have shown the possible reaction mechanism in Figure 2. The high nucleophilicity of DMAP contributed to its nucleophilic addition to the ester moiety of acetylsalicylic acid to form intermediate I, which was converted to a N-acylpyridinium intermediate by elimination of a phenoxide anion. Afterward, the N-acylpyridinium salt was nucleophilically attacked by the hydroxyl moiety of 2a,b to produce intermediate II, which was neutralized by the in situ formed phenoxide anion, followed by removal of DMAP and transformation into the desired ester 5a or 5b. We have attempted to obtain 6a,b and 7a,b by treating 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the EDCI/DMAP system. While the treatment of 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid indeed allows preparing 6a,b, we almost did not get other by-products. Interestingly, the main product obtained as a result of the interaction of acetylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with 2a,b is 5a,b instead of 7a,b.",

            "text": "The compounds 1a,b, 2a,b, 3a\u2013n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa, Hep-G2 and HSF cells by standard MTT assay. Gefitinib and doxorubicin were used as positive controls.40 Considering that the literatures related to this study used both micromolar studies of the cytotoxicity of OA and GA derivatives,31,32,41,42 so this research used micromolar to study the cytotoxicity of the compounds 1a,b, 2a,b, 3a\u2013n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b. The antitumor activities were expressed in terms of IC50 (\u03bcM) and are summarized in Table 1. On the whole, GA and its derivatives had better cytotoxicity than OA and its derivatives. The parent compounds OA and GA both showed low inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Hep-G2 cells and HSF cells. GA had better cytotoxicity values than gefitinib for SGC-7901 cells, Eca-109 cells and HeLa cells, especially for SGC-7901 cells with an IC50 value of 10.20\u00b11.23 \u03bcM, but OA showed a poor inhibitory effect on these three cell lines. In contrast to OA and GA, esterified compounds 2a and 2b with benzyl group exhibited relatively high inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Eca-109 cells and Hep-G2 cells. This indicated that the benzyl group introduced in C-28 position of OA or C-30 position of GA was beneficial to improve the inhibitory activity against these cancer cells. The selective inhibitory activity of the compounds was significantly enhanced when OA was further modified. Compounds 3a\u2013g showed strong inhibitory activities against Hep-G2 cells, but a poor inhibitory effect on HSF cells. This result is consistent with the test results of novel ligustrazine-oleanolic acid-amino acid derivatives synthesized by Chu et al.31 The R1 group was 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)butyroxy long-chain-substituted compound (3b, IC50 8.97\u00b10.13 \u03bcM), which had a significantly stronger inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells than 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetoxy short-chain-substituted compound (3a, IC50 24.47\u00b11.18 \u03bcM). Introducing salicyloyloxy (3d) to C-3 position of 2a led to a significant increase of the selective inhibitory activity with a low IC50 value of 4.06\u00b10.24 \u03bcM on Hep-G2 cells, but for HSF cells, it exhibited a poor inhibitory effect with a high IC50 value of 79.94\u00b14.42 \u03bcM. In addition, 3f and 3g with heteroaroyl group at C-3 position of 2a also presented the superior activity against Hep-G2 cells. Surprisingly, compounds 6a and 7a, bearing the same AcO group in different locations, presented a strong inhibitory activity against HeLa cells, and the compound with o-AcO substitutions (6a, IC50 11.98\u00b10.51 \u03bcM) at an aromatic ring was more active than the compound with p-AcO substitutions (7a, IC50 15.51\u00b10.73 \u03bcM). As a result of further modification of GA, the compounds exhibited different anticancer activities. Compounds 3h, 3i and 3k displayed a poor inhibitory effect on the five kinds of cancer cells, indicating that these organic acid moieties introduced in C-3 position of 2b were not beneficial to enhance their inhibitory activity. Compounds 3j and 3l exhibited a strongly selective inhibitory activity, and in particular, compound 3l showed the strongest inhibitory activity against HeLa cells with an IC50 value of 4.32\u00b10.89 \u03bcM, suggesting that an AcO substituent might enhance 3j toward tumor cell lines. Compounds 3m and 3n presented more potential anticancer activity in comparison with gefitinib, with compound 3m being the most active one, indicating that the heteroaroyl introduced in C-3 position of 2b was beneficial to enhance its inhibitory activity. The cytotoxicity of the derivatives obtained by the Schwarz and Csuk introduction of amino acids at the C-3 position of the GA benzyl ester is consistent with the present results.42 Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of compound 3m on HSF cells was lower than that of gefitinib (IC50, 20.54\u00b10.52 \u03bcM). In addition, 5b with AcO group at C-3 position of 2b showed the superior inhibitory activity against tumor cell lines, especially for Hep-G2 cells with an IC50 value of 3.74\u00b10.18 \u03bcM. Yadav et al43 used the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict that compound 5b has a significant inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells. Our experimental results are consistent with the predictions. Like compounds 6a and 7a, compounds 6b and 7b also presented strong targeting inhibition of HeLa cells with IC50 values of 7.82\u00b10.02 and 10.51\u00b10.62 \u03bcM, respectively.",

To further evaluate whether the cytotoxic effect of 5b is related to apoptosis, we detected cell apoptosis by Hoechst 33342 apoptotic staining kit and detected apoptosis rate by Annexin V/7-AAD double staining method (Figures 4 and 5). After treatment with different concentrations (0 \u03bcM for control, 4 and 8 \u03bcM) of compound 5b for 48 h, the nuclei of Hep-G2 cells were stained by Hoechst 33342 to detect the apoptotic cells. As shown in Figure 4, compared with the control group, a large number of cells with blue light spots were observed in the test group in a dose-dependent manner. The result indicated the existence of induced apoptosis caused by the treatment of compound 5b. Then, we used Annexin V-PE/7-AAD dual staining to detect the early and late apoptosis of Hep-G2 cells treated with different concentrations of compound 5b for 24 and 48 h. As shown in Figure 5, the population of apoptotic cells treated with compound 5b had increased remarkably with a dose- and time-dependent relation (the percentages of Annexin V-positive cells were 5.2% for the control group, 11.7% for 4 \u03bcM and 21.5% for 8 \u03bcM after 24 h treatment and 7.2% for the control group, 15.7% for 4 \u03bcM and 45.8% for 8 \u03bcM after 48 h treatment).",

To determine whether autophagy is truly triggered by these derivatives, Hep-G2 cells were treated with 0, 4 and 8 \u03bcM of compound 5b for 24 and 48 h. Then, the cells were stained with MDC as the fluorescent probe to detect the autophagic activity. As shown in Figure 6, exposure of Hep-G2 cells to different concentrations of compound 5b for 24 h led to an increase in MDC fluorescent intensity, with a mean (M) of M=1,171 for 0 \u03bcM as the control, M=1,458 for 4 \u03bcM and M=1,912 for 8 \u03bcM. At 48 h, this increase was maintained, with M=1,224 for 0 \u03bcM as the control, M=1,760 for 4 \u03bcM and M=2,480 for 8 \u03bcM. The increase in MDC fluorescent intensity demonstrates the increasing number of autophagic cells. The results indicate that the derivatives can induce autophagy in Hep-G2 cells, and the autophagic effect occurs in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.",

Among all the OA and GA derivatives, compound 3m was the most active anticancer agent against SGC-7901, MCF-7 and Eca-109 cells (IC50, 7.57\u00b10.64, 5.51\u00b10.41 and 5.03\u00b10.56 \u03bcM, respectively), while it showed lower inhibitory activity against normal HSF than gefitinib. For Hep-G2 cells, compound 5b showed the best cytotoxic effect (IC50, 3.74\u00b10.18 \u03bcM), and our pharmacological evaluation showed that compound 5b could induce autophagy and apoptosis in Hep-G2 cells. In addition, compound 3l exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against HeLa cells (IC50, 4.32\u00b10.89 \u03bcM) in comparison with four other cancer cell lines and presented low cytotoxicity toward HSF cells (IC50, 57.48\u00b10.57 \u03bcM). Because of its strong selective inhibition, 3l may be a potential new anti-Hela candidate drug, which has a unique mechanism of action and deserves further study. Like compound 3l, compound 3d presented the superior selective inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells (IC50, 4.06\u00b10.24 \u03bcM) in comparison with the other four cancer cell lines and also presented low cytotoxicity toward HSF cells (IC50, 79.94\u00b14.42 \u03bcM).
