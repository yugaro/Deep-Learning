            "text": "Acute respiratory infection (ARI), which could lead to serious complications including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, otitis media, and others, are thought to cause 4.25 million deaths each year.1 The populations most susceptible to fatal respiratory infection are those very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised.2 As the leading cause of illness in children, ARI causes approximately 1.8 million fatal cases of pneumonia per year among children <5 years of age.3,4 ARIs are classified as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Most URTIs are caused by viruses, including influenza virus A or B (IFVA/B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human coronavirus (CoV). URTIs are common but rarely life threatening, whereas LRTIs can lead to more severe illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Both of these infections can also be caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and others. With the use of molecular detection techniques, simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in patients with ARIs has been reported more frequently.5,6 The codetection of viral and bacterial pathogens is also quite common, especially in those less-developed countries.7,8 The significance of mixed detections for clinical severity is controversial with inconsistent results reported by the previous studies. The difficulties in establishing precise bacteriological or viral etiology and the frequent occurrence of mixed infections pose a challenge to medical treatment and clinical management. In the present study, we aimed to describe the detection of viruses and bacteria in hospitalized children with ARI in a subtropical city of mainland China, investigate the simultaneous detection pattern of multiple viruses and bacteria, and assess their association with clinical outcomes and severity.",

Fever caused by known chronic medical conditions was excluded. For recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples were collected on hospital admission after obtaining informed consent. We used a standardized Respiratory Syndrome Cases Information Questionnaire to collect data on demographics, underlying medical conditions, selected laboratory tests, radiographic findings, clinical manifestations, management, and outcomes. Pneumonia was defined by the presence of patchy alveolar opacities on chest radiographs, in addition to symptoms of cough, dyspnea (lower chest wall indrawing), or tachypnea (in infants, >50\u201360 breaths/min; in older children, >40 breaths/min). Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia with hypoxemia (maintained Sao2 < 92% in air) or rising respiratory and pulse rates with clinical evidence of respiratory distress and exhaustion with or without raised Paco2.",

The complementary DNA sample was synthesized by using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA). All samples were screened by RT-PCR or PCR for common respiratory viruses: IFVA, IFVB, RSV (A and B subtypes), PIV (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), RV, CoV (229E and OC43), human metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), and bocavirus (BoV) using standard methods as described elsewhere.9,10 As not all the samples were tested for subtypes of IFVA such as sH1N1, sH3N2, and pH1N1, here we did not evaluate by subtype. Qualitative and semiquantitative cultures for bacteria were performed immediately using standard microbiological methods.11,12 Macroscopically distinct colonies of the samples were isolated in pure culture, and standard methods were used for identification, typing with sensitivity patterns.",

Specifically, cases detected with CoV and K pneumoniae had higher rate (95.3% and 94.6%) of pneumonia among all pathogens detections. Those with detections of AdV and K pneumoniae had higher risk (28.8% and 28.0%) of severe pneumonia than others, whereas IFVB and K pneumoniae-detected cases had a higher risk (4.7% and 3.2%) of being transferred to the ICU. To further investigate the impact of codetection on the clinical outcomes as compared with the single detection, we applied logistic regression to estimate the OR with adjustment for age. Generally, the risk of developing pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and transfer to the ICU were not significantly different between those cases with codetections and single detection of either virus or bacteria (data not shown).",

The overall positive detection for any respiratory virus was 74.7%, and 22.2% for bacteria, with S pneumoniae most commonly detected in bacteria, and RSV, PIV, IFVA, and BoV among viruses, which was comparable to some other etiological studies within children or whole populations.13\u201316S pneumoniae was more often codetected with H parainfluenzae and H influenzae, and previous literature has reported the interaction between these common bacteria and suggested the mechanism like synergism or competition.17,18 Margolis et al19 reported an increase of H influenzae when either S pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus was present, indicating synergism between these bacterial species. Previous experiments by Lysenko et al20 observed competition between S pneumoniae and H influenzae in a mouse model of colonization. For H parainfluenzae, it is often been seen as an upper respiratory tract contaminant with other pathogens, with potential pathogenic role in lower respiratory tract in patients with severely impaired host defense.21 In this study, it had a high chance of being codetected with other bacteria (17.8) and viruses (74.8%), which may account for the high pneumonia rate in those detections with H parainfluenzae.",

What is more, the presence of pathogens tested by molecular techniques or conventional culture may not confirm significant pathogenic role at that time. As viral\u2013bacterial coinfection may lead to failure of the antibiotic therapy, this poses a challenge to efficient and effective treatments for those patients. Better understanding the pattern of mixed infection and their interaction, and assessing the clinical severity will be helpful for designing successful therapeutic strategies. Better and more sensitive etiologic diagnostic tool for respiratory microbial infection can reduce overuse of antibiotic in primary care.",

First, the database of this study included limited information on the disease outcomes (eg, the death records), thus may underestimate the severity and disease burden. Second, the use of antibiotics might obscure the real association between these viral and bacterial detections in this study. Third, for the sputum as we had no information on the bacterial load of these positive detected cases, quantitative comparison could not be implemented in this study. Fourth, 79% of the cases had sputum culture results, with 667 cases undetected for bacteria, which may lead to underestimation of the bacterial burden. On the other hand, sputum might be contaminated by upper airway tract secretions, leading to overestimation. Last, the detection of the pathogens does not mean that it is the cause of the illness, thus it is difficult to determine the real cause of the patients\u2019 illness.",
