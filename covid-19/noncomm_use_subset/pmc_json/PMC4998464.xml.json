            "text": "Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) developing acute respiratory failure (ARF) require invasive mechanical ventilation to assist spontaneous breath and sustain life.[1,2] Although it is effective, observational studies have indicated that protracted invasive ventilation may pose the risk of complications such as sinusitis,[3] respiratory muscle weakness, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).[4] VAP has been closely related to increasing mortality and morbidity.[1,5] To mitigate complications associated with prolonged invasive ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation, that is, shifting from invasive support to noninvasive support in patients considered ready to be extubated but not ready for removal of mechanical ventilation,[6] has been investigated to be of benefit in reducing duration of invasive ventilation, incidence of VAP, and mortality rate.[2,7] Meanwhile, optimizing the timing for using noninvasive ventilation is a key factor in the successful treatment of ARF in AECOPD patients.[8] Premature extubation and immediate application of noninvasive ventilation will cause loss of airway protection, respiratory muscle overload and fatigue, as well as suboptimal gas exchange,[9] while deferred use of noninvasive support may increase the risk of adverse complications. Therefore, an optimal timing must be carefully chosen to achieve the balance between the potential risk associated with early removal of invasive ventilation and delayed application of noninvasive ventilation. The pulmonary infection control (PIC) window, recently identified by Wang et al,[10] may be selected as an appropriate timing for replacing invasive ventilation with noninvasive ventilation. After receiving invasive ventilation and adequate antibiotics for 6 to 7 days, the patient\u2019 s pulmonary infection is substantially controlled when the following indices are present: significant decrease in infectious infiltrations demonstrated by lung radiography; noticeable changes of phlegm (less amount, lower tenacity, and lighter or white color); and at least one or more following signs: body temperature <37.5\u00b0C, peripheral white blood count (WBC) <10 \u00d7 109/L, or WBC reduced by 2 \u00d7 109/L.[10,11] This period of time is referred to the PIC window. Previous studies[10,12] indicated that noninvasive ventilation used at this timing significantly reduced duration of invasive ventilation, VAP, and hospital death for AECOPD patients with ARF. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [13\u201315] found no significant differences on mortality, weaning failures, or reintubation rates between patients receiving noninvasive ventilation and those continuing invasive ventilation. But a recent meta-analysis[16] found that using noninvasive ventilation at the PIC window was associated with lower mortality, lower VAP incidence, and shorter invasive ventilation time.",

I2 statistic was used to quantify the degree of heterogeneity.

Subgroup analyses were carried out where available to investigate potential influence of clinical characteristics of participants or methodological quality on treatment effect size. Sensitivity analyses were performed where available to explore possible heterogeneity and its impact on the robustness of study results.

It does not need an artificial airway, and provides partial ventilatory support for patients who have obtained the ability to continue spontaneous breathing but still require ventilator support.[6] In this study, we found that timely extubation and immediate use of noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced the duration of invasive ventilation of 6 days. Consequently, both the incidence of VAP and mortality were reduced, higher successful weaning rates were also observed. In the meantime, the total duration of mechanical ventilation was decreased by 6 days. The reuse of a tracheal tube may exacerbate the existing damage to the tracheal mucosa.[51] Because noninvasive ventilation does not require tracheal intubation, the cough reflex is hence preserved, and it has been applied in patients with respiratory failure, effectively improving oxygenation and ventilation and reducing reintubation rates.[52] This study also proved that patients using noninvasive ventilation occurred less reintubations than those receiving invasive ventilation. Important benefits from noninvasive ventilation included the reductions of VAP and length of ICU or hospital stay, which closely associated with medical costs.[53] There was strong evidence to indicate that noninvasive ventilation was cost-effective. The greatest cost benefit, a reduction of 2000 US dollars, mainly owed to the reduction of VAP and avoidance of an ICU or hospital admission.",

Consequently, unclear randomization and allocation concealment may lead to a potential possibility of selection bias. The quality of evidence was influenced by considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes of duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital, and hospital costs. Substantial heterogeneity may arise from the changing conditions of patients and the blood gas analysis during ventilation, which were indirectly reflected by the different ventilator modes, as 5 studies[30,32,35,36,40] used (SIMV + PSV + PEEP), 3 studies[40,42,44] used (A/C +SIMV + PSV), 2 studies[33,43] used (SIMV + PSV). Such inconsistencies relating to patients\u2019 clinical characteristics during the treatment were the reasons for downgrading one level of the evidence. Regarding imprecision, in addition to the CIs and the lines of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm, another criterion, the OIS, is also a determinant to guarantee adequate precision. The OIS is referred to the number of participants estimated by a sample size calculation for a single adequately powered trial.[56] If the total number of participants of a meta-analysis is lower than the OIS criterion, the quality of evidence should be downgraded because of imprecision.[57] In this study, although the 95% CIs of the outcome of reintubations excluded a relative risk of 1.0 and the appreciable harm,[57] the total number of participants (n = 327) of the meta-analysis did not exceed the OIS (n = 398); it was therefore more likely to support the decision to downgrade the evidence quality due to impression. Because no substantial differences existed between the patients\u2019 baseline characteristics or the outcomes measured in the included studies, we considered the indirectness was not serious. Potential publication bias was detected regarding the outcome VAP through visual inspection. So, the quality of evidence on this outcome was rated down. Overall, the quality of evidence with respect to the 9 critical or important outcomes was graded from moderate to low, and the uncertainty of long-term effects was more likely to warrant a weak recommendation of noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window for ARF in AECOPD patients.",

To the best of our knowledge, this review first applied GRADE approach to appraise the quality of evidence and to generate recommendation regarding the use of noninvasive intervention at PIC window for ARF in AECOPD patients. In addition, this review can offer the potential opportunity to readers who are unable to get access to and read the original articles published in Chinese.

We noted that no study used a power calculation to estimate the optimal sample size or gave comments on their sample size. One study[37] included only 25 participants; we doubted whether the small sample size was enough to achieve an adequate statistical power to detect the differences between noninvasive ventilation group and invasive ventilation group. In addition, our included trials were conducted in China. This is mainly because approximately 80% to 90% of COPD patients are caused by pulmonary infection in China,[10] and the PIC window was identified by Chinese researchers, Wang et al. Timely extubation at this period of time might be more precisely judged and then using noninvasive ventilation may improve treatment efficacy. However, whether it is still effective or could be applied to patients outside of China still needs to be further investigated.",

The authors included patients with ARF for any cause (COPD, non-COPD, postoperative, nonoperative) and selected any timing of using noninvasive ventilation (a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial failure, a 30-minute T-piece trial failure, PIC window). They found noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced mortality, weaning failures, VAP, LOS in ICU, and so forth. However, they did not separately investigate the impact of noninvasive ventilation using at PIC window for ARF due to COPD. Our review specifically addressed COPD participants and PIC window, and found beneficial effects of this intervention. A prior meta-analysis[16] explored the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window for ARF in COPD patients. The authors only retrieved 2 databases (PubMed and CNKI, from 2000 to 2012) and included 3 outcomes (mortality, VAP, and invasive ventilation time). Compared with it, our review searched 7 electronic databases and gray literature databases as well as references lists; we identified 9 critical or important outcomes and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence regarding these outcomes. Because we searched relevant databases from the inception through October 2015, our review may be considered the up-to-date evidence on this issue and be more comprehensive and robust to draw the conclusion.",
