The full-length cDNA of the LCMV Armstrong GP was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA. Total RNA was purified from the brain of a mouse that had been persistently infected with LCMV Armstrong since birth. cDNA was made using random hexamer primers and murine Maloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described (17). PCR amplification of the viral GP was done using primers that hybridize to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the GP sequence: primer 1, which hybridizes to bp 1\u201326, 5\u2032-CCGGGGATCCTAGGCTTTTTGGATTG-3\u2032; and primer 2, which hybridizes to bp 1553\u20131585, 5\u2032\u2013GGGGATCCTGTTCTTCAGCGTCTTTTCCAGAC\u20133\u2032. PCR was done using Taq Polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) following reaction conditions indicated by the manufacturer and performing 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 3 min. The 1575-bp product was cloned into the TA vector system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and then digested with BamHI. The NP and GP cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of pMBP001, which contains sequences from \u22121907 to +36 of the MBP promoter, followed by a polylinker region linked to a portion of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene as described (18). The PLP sequences provided splice and polyadenylation signals and included PLP exon 6, intron 6, and exon 7. Linear DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions plus NP or GP sequences were obtained by NotI digestion. The DNA was microinjected in The Scripps Research Institute Transgenic Facility into BALB/cByJ \u00d7 C57BL/6J fertilized eggs. LCMV\u2013NP transgenic mice were bred to BALB/ cByJ (H-2d) mice, and the LCMV\u2013GP transgenic mice were bred to C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice. MBP\u2013\u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2gal) transgenic mice (18) were bred to BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J mice. All nontransgenic breeder mice were obtained from the breeding colony at The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA).",

Mice were characterized for RNA expression by RT-PCR on total RNA isolated as described (17), using primers that hybridize within the transgene and a primer that hybridizes within PLP exon 7. RT-PCR products corresponding to correctly spliced NP transgenes were 510 bp (NP) and 780 bp (GP). RNase protection assays for cytokine mRNA expression were done on 2\u20134 mice using 15 \u03bcg of purified total brain RNA or 1 \u03bcg of poly-(A)+ mRNA as described (20, 21). The relative amounts of cytokine RNA were quantitated by using the Series 400 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Imager units (PI units) were normalized to equivalence based on values for rpL32 transcripts, which encode the L32 ribosomal protein (20, 22).",

By amplifying a product across the intron as shown in Fig. 1\nA, spliced mRNA could be distinguished from both unspliced mRNA as well as contaminating genomic DNA. RT-PCR product that corresponded in size to correctly spliced RNA message was identified in the brains of 7 out of 8 MBP\u2013NP lines and in 7 out of 7 MBP\u2013 GP lines. An RT-PCR survey of RNA from various organs did not detect transgene-specific message in the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, lung, heart, or sciatic nerve. However, \u223c25% of the lines showed spliced RNA transgene expression in the thymus. Two MBP\u2013NP (5 and 60) and two MBP-GP (36 and 46) lines with only CNS expression of the transgenes were chosen for further study (Fig. 1, B and C) and bred to the F4 level to BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Immunohistochemical approaches (in situ immunohistochemistry and Western blot) were undertaken to identify the transgene products in brain tissue; however, these attempts were unsuccessful. Protein expression in the MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP mice is likely below the level of sensitivity of antibody detection. Previous attempts at identifying LCMV gene products expressed as a transgene of the rat insulin promoter in the \u03b2 cells of the Islets of Langerhans had also failed (19). However, these transgenic mice were subsequently shown to express the transgene as shown by CTL recognition of pancreatic \u03b2 cells, T cell recognition being at least two logs more sensitive than antibody recognition (28, 29).",

Therefore, the first question addressed was whether the transgenic mice were immunologically responsive to the transgene (self) products. The ability of the MBP\u2013LCMV transgenic mice to generate both anti-viral (self) CTL and antibodies was assessed. CTL responses of the transgenic mice were measured in 51Cr release assays using splenic lymphocytes harvested 7 d after infection with LCMV. Transgenic and nontransgenic mice from all four transgenic MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP lines were able to lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with LCMV (Table 1). In addition, BALB clone 7 (H-2d) target cells infected with a recombinant VV expressing the NP from LCMV (VV\u2013NP) were lysed by lymphocytes from MBP\u2013NP transgenic positive and negative mice. Likewise, MC57 (H-2b) target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the GP from LCMV (VV\u2013GP) were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP\u2013GP transgenic positive and negative mice. The ability of transgenic mice to mount anti-LCMV antibody responses was evaluated using an ELISA assay with gradient-purified LCMV. At 2 mo after infection with LCMV, MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP transgenic positive and negative mice showed good antibody responses (antibody titers >105; data not shown). Thus, the transgenic positive mice generated LCMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses equivalent to transgenic negative mice, indicating they were able to mount immune responses to the viral self-proteins expressed as transgenes.

Approximately 1,000 lymphocytes were observed per sagittal section at 1 wk after infection in both transgenic positive and negative mice. The majority of these lymphocytes were CD8+ and were found within the meninges and ventricular linings of the brain. These cells were most likely activated by the viral infection and were trafficking through the CNS as a normal part of immune surveillance after activation in the periphery (32). By 2 wk after infection, fewer meningeal infiltrating cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. By 3 wk after infection, in nontransgenic mice less than 30 lymphocytes could be found per sagittal section, and by 5 wk after infection less than 5 lymphocytes were detected per section. In contrast, in transgenic positive mice, at 3 wk after infection about 150\u2013 300 CD8+ cells were found per section. These cells were located in the brain parenchyma as well as the brain stem and spinal cord, and perivascular cuffs were often observed. In addition, CD4+ cells were present and comprised 20% of the infiltrating T cells. Brains of transgenic positive mice taken at various times after infection were found to contain this level of CD8+ infiltrates as long as 1 yr after infection. By 1 yr after infection, the numbers of CD4+ staining cells had risen to approximately half the number of CD8+ staining cells per section. At 3 wk after infection, the infiltrating cells did not localize to any particular area or location within the brain. By 3 mo after infection, clusters of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were found predominantly within the white matter regions of the CNS, including the corpus callosum, internal capsule, fimbria hippocampus, brain stem, and spinal cord (Fig. 2, A, B, F, G). Lymphocytes were isolated from the brains of MBP\u2013NP transgenic positive mice 3 wk after LCMV infection and tested in 51Cr-release CTL assays after in vitro stimulation with LCMV. These lymphocytes were found to effectively lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with either LCMV or recombinant VV expressing the LCMV NP (data not shown).",

The presence of B cells in the infiltrating population was examined using antibody to the B cell marker, B220. Insignificant numbers of B220+ cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. Antibody to F4/80, a cell surface marker found on microglia, monocytes, and macrophages, revealed an upregulation of this molecule in regions of infiltrating T cells in transgenic positive mice (Fig. 2, C and H). Microglial activation was observed as long as 1 yr after infection in association with T cell infiltration. Antibodies to MHC class I and II molecules were used to determine whether an increase in these antigen presentation markers was observed in response to the immune cell infiltration (Fig. 2, D, E, I, J ). In uninfected and LCMV-infected nontransgenic mice, MHC class I antigen staining was limited to the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. MHC class II staining was confined to a few macrophage-like cells in the interstitium of the choroid plexus. Staining for MHC class I and class II molecules in the brains of transgenic positive mice revealed that by 6 wk after infection there was an upregulation of both of these antigens on CNS cells in the vicinity of the infiltrating T cells, particularly pronounced in white matter regions. Antibody to MHC class I detected a fine reticular staining pattern in white matter regions, as well as staining many distinct cell types including those with microglial, lymphocyte, and endothelial cell morphology. Oligodendrocytes expressing MHC class I were identified by laser scanning confocal microscopy by colocalizing antibody to 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNP) with antibody to MHC class I (Horwitz, M.S, C.F. Evans, and M.B.A. Oldstone, manuscript submitted for publication). Anti-MHC class II antibodies stained cells of different morphologies including cells similar to microglia. This upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules was observed in association with infiltrating lymphocytes for at least 1 yr after infection with LCMV. Light and confocal microscopic analyses of sagittal brain sections stained with luxol fast blue or antibodies to myelin basic protein and CD8 failed to reveal any areas of myelin damage in the transgenic mice after a single LCMV infection.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the CNS showed a three- to fivefold increase in CD8+ lymphocytes in the transgenic positive mice at 4 wk after second infection with either LCMV or VV\u2013NP, as compared with transgenic positive mice infected singly with LCMV at the same time after primary infection (10 wk). Additionally, a 10-fold increase in the number of CD4+ T cells was detected compared with the number of cells observed after a single infection. The ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ cells in the doubly infected mice was 2:1 (Fig. 3, A and B). The infiltrating cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice were found predominantly within white matter structures of the brain, and perivascular cuffs were observed. Coinciding with these increased levels of T cell infiltration, enhanced areas of F4/80 staining were observed (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, an upregulation of the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was observed. A marked increase in the expression of both MHC class I and II markers was observed in areas rich in myelin and coinciding with regions of T cell infiltration (Fig. 3, E\u2013H).

MBP\u2013NP transgenic positive and negative mice that had been infected with LCMV 6 wk previously were infected with either VV or PV. 4\u20138 wk later, the mice were killed and CNS tissues were examined. Stimulation of the memory response by these unrelated viruses resulted in enhanced pathology similar to that seen after a second infection with LCMV. This included greater numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes, an increase in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocytes, and a high preponderance of these infiltrates in white matter-rich areas (Fig. 6, A and B). Additionally, activation of microglia and astrocytes, as measured by increased F4/80 and GFAP expression, were observed, as well as increased upregulation of the antigen presentation MHC class I and II molecules throughout the white matter regions. Infiltrating lymphocytes formed lesions within the white matter tracts of the CNS. These lesions showed a loss of MBP staining accompanied by uptake of MBP by activated microglia/macrophages similar to that observed after a second infection with LCMV.",

Without infecting the CNS, this virus induced disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the CNS and clinical motor dysfunction. This finding is significant, since several recent reports have provided evidence that molecular mimicry induced by a virus or other pathogen may play a role in the etiology of human CNS autoimmune diseases. For example, evidence for molecular mimicry between viral proteins and human MBP was found on the basis of structural similarities between an immunodominant MBP peptide and viral peptide sequences (10). Specific peptides from herpes simplex, adeno-, human papilloma, Epstein\u2013Barr, influenza, and reo-viruses were able to activate human MBP-specific T cell clones that had been established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of two multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. A peptide from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also able to activate one of the MBP-specific T cell clones. Activation of the MBPspecific T cell clones by as many as 3\u20134 different viral peptides indicated that a single TCR could recognize peptides from several unrelated sources, and this recognition resulted in T cell activation. In other studies, T cell lines established from MS patients were reactive to both MBP and a sequence from the human respiratory coronavirus 229E (11, 34). Additionally, molecular mimicry between human transaldolase (TAL-H), which in the brain is expressed selectively in oligodendrocytes, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag proteins has also been described (12). TAL-H stimulated proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS, and in addition, autoantibodies to TAL-H were detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of these patients. Thus, molecular mimicry between viruses and oligodendrocyte proteins may be important in the etiology of a human CNS autoimmune disease such as MS.",

In this model, no evidence for T cell tolerance to the viral (self) transgene products was obtained. Thymic expression of transgene mRNA was not detected by RTPCR, and CTL and antibody responses to the transgene were similar to those observed in nontransgenic mice. Since transgene product\u2013specific CTL could be isolated from the brains of transgenic mice following infection with LCMV, this indicated that self-reactive T cells in the periphery were activated by the viral infection and trafficked into the CNS where the transgene was expressed. T cells reactive to MBP have been isolated from healthy individuals as well as MS patients (35).

This enhancement likely resulted from the activation of LCMV-specific memory T cells that traveled into the CNS, where they encountered transgene-expressing oligodendrocytes presenting LCMV peptides in association with MHC class I molecules. Increased levels of cytokines typically associated with activated CD8+/ CD4+ (Th1) cells were detected (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b2), as well as cytokines associated with activated macrophages/microglia (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12p40, and TNF-\u03b1). IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 have been shown to increase MHC class I and/or class II molecules on a variety of cells (36\u201339), and thus the presence of these cytokines may account for the widespread upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules observed after double infection. In addition, TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 have been shown to be cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro (40, 41). Damage to oligodendrocytes was demonstrated by confocal microscopic analyses of the lesions of infiltrating lymphocytes within the white matter. A number of observations were consistent with active myelin degradation, including the loss of MBP staining at the center of these lesions, the irregular shape of the lesions, the presence of activated microglia/macrophages in and around the lesions, and the uptake of MBP by these activated microglia/macrophages.",

MS is further characterized by the presence of plaques of demyelination in the CNS. These mice showed focal areas of demyelination consistent with sites of early plaque development. It is possible that additional environmental or genetic factors could influence further plaque development. Currently, studies are being done to manipulate the susceptibility of these mice to demyelination by evaluating the effects of genetic background, CNS cytokine expression, and TCR usage. Viruses have often been implicated in the etiology of MS (42, 43), but it has not been possible to link just one virus with the disease.

This was not surprising, because the primary T cell response to LCMV is mediated by CD8+ cells (13, 14). However, no obvious damage to oligodendrocytes was observed after a single LCMV infection of transgenic mice. After a second viral infection of the transgenic mice, the proportion of CD4+ T cells increased relative to the number of CD8+ T cells (CD8+/CD4+, 2:1). Focal areas of myelin degradation were observed (Fig. 4), and expression of both MHC class I and class II molecules was found on oligodendrocytes (Horwitz, M.S., C.F. Evans, and M.B.A. Oldstone, manuscript submitted for publication). These findings suggest that CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells may interact directly with oligodendrocytes and play a role in oligodendrocyte injury. In addition, the total number of infiltrating T cells in the CNS increased three- to fivefold after a second infection with LCMV. Other models of autoimmune diseases have shown that the number of self-reactive T cells influences the development of disease (44\u201346), so it is possible that the myelin damage seen after a second LCMV infection was a result of the increased numbers of infiltrating T cells.",

Upon infection with LCMV, immune-mediated destruction of the \u03b2 cells occurred, resulting in diabetes. Although the transgenes and the infecting virus are the same in the pancreatic and the CNS models, destruction of the transgene-expressing target cells was much more severe in the diabetic model. The primary difference between these models is the organ in which the transgene is expressed. The CNS is unique due to the blood\u2013brain barrier, which restricts the entry of certain cells and molecules from the blood, and the low or nondetectable expression of both MHC class I and class II molecules. It is likely that the nature of the immune response in the target organs is influenced by several factors, including differences in permeability of the islet capillaries and blood\u2013brain barrier to various immune cells, in expression of adhesion and MHC molecules on endothelial and target cells, in types of antigen-presenting cells present, and in the local cytokine milieu. Delineation of the factors that determine the outcome of the transgene-specific immune response should reveal important differences between autoimmune disease of a peripheral organ such as the pancreas, and the CNS.",

This could be due to a general nonspecific stimulation of memory cells (bystander activation) after the upregulation of cytokine expression in response to the second viral infection (49). Preliminary experiments have shown that treatment of LCMV-immune MBP\u2013NP mice with the interferon-inducer poly I/C (50, 51) did not result in enhanced CNS pathology. Alternatively, reactivation may be a result of cross-reactivities of LCMV-specific CTL with heterologous viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules (33, 52). Experiments to distinguish between these possibilities are in progress. After poliovirus immunization of human adults previously vaccinated for polio in childhood, immune responses to unrelated antigens (reovirus and tetanus toxoid) were observed, indicating that secondary activation of immune responses also occurs in humans (53). The cross-activation of memory T cells specific for an oligodendrocyte protein by subsequent viral infections may explain why patients with an autoimmune disease such as MS often exhibit disease exacerbations after infections by different viruses (54\u201356). It may also serve to explain both the long lag period before disease symptoms and the risk factor association of disease to the first 15 yr of life (57). A cross-reactive immune response to oligodendrocyte-specific antigens through a process of molecular mimicry early in life could lead to the generation of memory T cells specific for a myelin antigen. These self-reactive T cells could then be reactivated after subsequent pathogen exposures, eventually leading to clinically observable disease exacerbations. Exploitation of the model described here will be useful for evaluating the potential of unrelated viruses to contribute to the exacerbation of CNS autoimmune disease, and for developing therapies to modify such disease.",
