The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Sb in healthy dogs and dogs with chronic enteropathies (CE). Sb was formulated in 10x109 CFU capsules. Its concentration and viability within the capsules was controlled by yeast culture in subsequent steps until expiration date. Four healthy dogs (HD) and 18 dogs with CE (10 inflammatory bowel disease \u2010 IBD, 8 protein losing enteropathy \u2010 PLE) were included. In HD Sb was administered for 10 days (1x109 CFU/kg BID); daily clinical evaluation was performed to assess possible adverse effects and quantitative stool cultures for yeasts were performed before, during and after the administration. In dogs with CE a randomized double blind placebo\u2010control study was performed, administering Sb (1x109 CFU/kg BID) or placebo (Pl). Sb or Pl administration was added to standard therapeutic protocols (diet, antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs), to evaluate its efficacy for the treatment of IBD and PLE. Complete blood work, abdominal ultrasonography, gastro\u2010duodenal and colon endoscopy and histopathological evaluation of intestinal samples were performed at diagnosis and after 60 days of treatment. Validated score system for the clinical signs (CECCAI), ultrasonography, endoscopy and histopathology were applied. Significance was set for P < 0.05. Results in HD showed the absence of Sb in the faeces before treatment, its presence after one day, its steady state (10x107 CFU/g) after 5 days and its complete elimination 4 days after withdrawal of treatment. No adverse effects were reported. In CE dogs the clinical score improved significantly in dogs receiving Sb compared to dogs receiving Pl (P = 0.009). In PLE dogs the albumin concentration increased significantly (P = 0.034) in the group receiving Sb with respect to Pl. The daily frequency of defecation in the Sb group was significantly lower with respect to Pl after 45 (P = 0.032) and 60 (P = 0.004) days of treatment. No statistical differences were found between dogs receiving Sb and Pl after treatment, based on the endoscopic evaluation of duodenum and colon. No statistical differences were found between the two groups on the duodenal ultrasonographic and histological evaluation after treatment. In conclusion, Sb can be safely used in dogs with CE, in addition to standard treatment, to achieve a better control of clinical signs and a significant increase in albumin concentration compared to the standard therapy alone.",

Previous studies suggest a pivotal role for gut bacteria in disease pathogenesis since luminal microbial composition is markedly altered (ie, dysbiosis) at diagnosis. Probiotic bacteria appear to be therapeutically effective in some forms of human IBD. Controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of probiotic therapy for canine IBD have not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to characterize the mucosa\u2010associated microbiota and determine the clinical, microbiological, and mucosal homeostatic effects of orally administered VSL#3 probiotics in dogs with IBD. Twenty dogs diagnosed with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe IBD (CIBDAI score > 5) were randomized to receive standard therapy (ie, elimination diet and glucocorticoids) with or without probiotic VSL#3. The mucosal microbiota from endoscopic intestinal biopsies of IBD dogs and controls was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting the 16S rRNA genes of total bacteria, group\u2010specific organisms, and individual bacterial species shown to be relevant in human IBD. Epithelial tight junction protein (TJP) expression was studied using immunohistochemistry. Clinical signs and changes in mucosal microbiota and TJP expression were assessed before and after probiotic VSL#3 therapy. IBD dogs showed a reduction in GI signs following 8 weeks of probiotic therapy compared with baseline CIBDAI scores (P < 0.05). Adherent and sporadic invasive bacteria (EUB) were observed in the small intestines and colon of healthy dogs. The diseased canine duodenum was nearly bacteria\u2010free. IBD dogs given probiotic VSL #3 had altered spatial redistribution of most bacterial groups in the mucus and adherent compartments of the colon. Subset analysis showed that Lactobacilli were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the lumen and mucus post\u2010VSL #3, while the number of mucus laden Bifidobacteria approached significance (P = 0.08). Expression of TJP showed that occludin was significantly lower in control intestines as compared to duodenal and colonic mucosa obtained from IBD dogs that received probiotic (P = 0.008 and P = 0.01, respectively). In contrast, claudin\u20102 expression in the colon was significantly higher (P < 0.002) in control dogs versus VSL #3 treated IBD dogs. Our data demonstrate that probiotic VSL#3 alters some of the mucosa\u2010associated microbiota in dogs with IBD. These probiotic changes in bacterial composition are associated with up\u2010regulated TJP expression indicative of enhanced epithelial barrier integrity, similar to VSL#3\u2010induced disease protection seen in human IBD.",

In humans and mice, administration of probiotics can alleviate IBD severity and/or prevent relapse by induction of a more \u201ctolerant\u201dmicroenvironment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 E1707 (EF) on intestinal microbiome composition. Dogs were recruited to receive EF at 1x10e8 cfu in a double\u2010blinded, placebo\u2010controlled manner in addition to an exclusion diet (hydrolysed protein). Seven dogs were included in the probiotics group and 5 dogs in the placebo group. All dogs improved clinically after treatment, however, there was no obvious effect on clinical severity in those that received probiotics. Fresh naturally voided faecal samples were collected from all dogs before and after treatment, snap\u2010frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2010 80\u00b0C until further analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from each faecal sample using the Mobio Power soil DNA isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories), as recommended by the manufacturer. Next generation sequencing was performed on the Ion\u2010Torrent[TRADEMARK] (Life Technologies) platform based upon the V1\u2010V3 region (E. coli position 27\u2010519) of the 16S rRNA gene with the following primers: forward 28F: GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG and reverse 519R: GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG. Raw sequence data were screened, trimmed, filtered, and chimera depleted with default settings using the QIIME pipeline version 1.8 and UCHIME software, in which microbiome composition between treatment groups before and after treatment was compared.",

We hypothesized that in AATE, local, affected\u2010limb venous glucose concentration decreases below reference interval, while systemic glucose concentration remains unaffected. The study included 3 groups for each species: paralytic AATE cases, non\u2010ambulatory controls with limb paralysis of orthopedic or neurologic disorders, and ambulatory controls diagnosed with various diseases.

Peripheral blood glucose concentrations were decreased (P \u2264 0.006) only in cats and dogs with AATE. \u0394Glu and %\u0394Glu were higher in the AATE groups in both cats and dogs compared to their respective control groups (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, respectively), with no differences between the control groups.

All the patients underwent a total body MRI (MRI Intera 1.5T, Philips Medical Systems) that provided the final diagnosis. The arterial thrombosis location was documented and the entity was scored. All the eleven patients were diagnosed with a peripheral thrombosis involving an arterial vessel and in some cases the relative branches. The thrombus was located: in the abdominal aorta (7/11), in the subclavian artery (1/11), in the axillary artery (1/11), in the iliac arteries (2/11). Of the total amount of abdominal aortic thrombosis, 3/7 involved also the internal iliac arteries, 2/7 the external ones and 2/7 both internal and external. The extent of the thrombosis was classified as grade 1 (G1), when the greatest portion of the thrombus did not reach half of the vessel lumen (1/11 patients); grade 2 (G2), when the greatest portion of the thrombus was between 1/2 and 2/3 of the vessel lumen (7/11); grade 3 (G3), when the thrombus exceded 2/3 of the lumen (3/11).

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) may develop secondary to hypoxic vasoconstriction and/or pulmonary parenchymal infiltration. In the absence of measurable tricuspid regurgitation (TR), this co\u2010morbid condition may be difficult to diagnose non\u2010invasively. The degree of cardio\u2010pulmonary impairment in CIPF dogs can be evaluated through blood gas analysis (BGA) and 6 minute walking test (6MWT). A new echocardiographic index, the right pulmonary vein to pulmonary artery ratio (PV/PA) has been described for the detection of pulmonary venous hypertension. The aim of this study was to investigate PV/PA in CIPF in order to determine its utility in the detection of PH and in the assessment of cardio\u2010pulmonary disease severity. This prospective clinical cohort study included 10 WHWT with CIPF (Group A), 9 healthy WHWT (Group B) and 25 healthy dogs from other breeds (Group C). Diameters of right PV and PA were measured, in bi\u2010dimensional (BD) and M\u2010modes (MM), in a parasternal right long axis view, at the end of the T wave. Other echocardiographic parameters for evaluation of PH were also measured: speed of TR, acceleration time to ejection time ratio of the pulmonary flow (AT:ET) and pulmonary artery to aorta ratio (PA/Ao). BGA was performed in 14 dogs (9, 1 and 4 in groups A, B and C) and 6MWT in 17 dogs (8, 6 and 3). Values are given as mean\u00b1SD. In BD and MM mode, the PV/PA ratio was lower in group A (MM: 0.62 \u00b1 0.25, BD: 0.51 \u00b1 0.20) compared to group B (MM: 0.98 \u00b1 0.17, BD: 0.93 \u00b1 0.12, P \u2264 0.01) and group C (MM: 1.03 \u00b1 0.13, BD: 1.00 \u00b1 0.10, P \u2264 0.0001). The changes in PV/PA were both due to an increase of PA (P \u2264 0.01) and a decrease of PV (P \u2264 0.05). TR was found in 60% of dogs with CIPF; mean pressure gradient was 34.03 \u00b1 16.90 mmHg. AT:ET was lower in group A (0.42 \u00b1 0.08) compared to group C (0.50 \u00b1 0.04, P = 0.002) and tended to be lower compared to group B (0.48 \u00b1 0.07, P = 0.09). PA/Ao was not statistically different between groups. PV/PA was correlated with arterial pO2 values (B mode: r = 0.870, P = 0.0001) and results of the 6MWT (B mode: r = 0.791, P = 0.0003). PV/PA was also correlated with AT:ET and the speed of TR, but not with PA/Ao. In conclusion, in WHWT affected by CIPF, PV/PA is a useful indicator of PH and could serve in the assessment of disease severity.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long\u2010term outcome in VSD patients. Case records of 95 animals were reviewed, 46 of these re\u2010evaluated echocardiographically and 49 followed up by phone interview only. Out of 53 dogs Pug was the most common breed (11%) followed by Border Terrier (8%). Out of 42 cats Domestic Short Hair was most common (55%) followed by Main Coon (19%). Isolated VSDs were present in 29 dogs and 26 cats. Complex defects (CDs) were present in 40 cases, most frequent anomalies being sub\u2010aortic stenosis (9 dogs, 1 cat), pulmonic stenosis (5 dogs, 3 cats), Tetralogy of Fallot (3 dogs, 2 cats), cushion defects (5 cats) and double\u2010chambered right ventricle (DCRV) (5 dogs, 4 cats; in 2/5 dogs not present initially supporting the cause\u2010and\u2010effect theory). Eisenmenger was observed in 1 dog and 2 cats. Aortic insufficiency, not considered a CD, was noted in 10 dogs. In 3 dogs and 6 cats (15% of isolated VSDs and 1 cat with a DCRV) the defect closed spontaneously. Nine dogs and 9 cats (22%) died of non\u2010cardiac causes with an age at death of 5 to 204 (mean 63.8) months; 7 dogs and 8 cats died due to cardiac causes with an age at death of 0.25 to 204 (mean 37.5) months. Cardiac deaths were sudden (2 dogs with CDs) or euthanasia for left sided congestive heart (CHF) failure associated with CDs (3 dogs, 1 cat); right sided CHF associated with CDs (2 cats); biventricular failure (1 cat with CD); weakness (Eisenmenger, 1 dog and 1 cat; Fallot 1 dog; CD 1 cat). Two cats developed CHF due to unrelated HCM. Only one dog with an isolated VSD was euthanized for CHF.",

It's characterized by myxomatous degeneration, which causes mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral regurgitation (MR) and a left apical systolic murmur (LASM). MVD affects small breed dogs with a very high prevalence in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). The main goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of LASM, MVP and MR in the Maltese, the most presented breed among dogs with MVD in Taiwan. The correlation between these 3 measurements and the influence of age, gender, reproductive state, and body weight were also investigated. Study results were compared to other MVD prevalence studies in Europe and North\u2010America. 162 client\u2010owned Maltese dogs (75 males and 87 females; body weight 1.35\u20107.15 kg; age 2\u201015 yrs) with no signs of heart failure were recruited. The intensity (grade 1\u20106) of LASM was recorded. Grade of MVP (mild/severe) and MR severity (mild/moderate/severe) were evaluated by echocardiography. Logistic regression was used to determine the correlation between age and presence of LASM, MVP and MR. A Chi\u2010square test was used to evaluate whether sex and reproductive\u2010status were related to prevalences of LASM, MVP and MR. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationships between age, body weight, LASM intensity, grade of MVP and severity of MR. The prevalence of LASM, MVP and MR were 28.4%, 34% and 41.4%, respectively. All have positive correlation with age (p = 0.000). The age at which 50% of the dogs had LASM, MVP and MR was 7.7, 7.5, and 5.6 years, respectively. The LASM intensity, MVP grade and MR severity were all positively correlated to age (all p = 0.000) and had no correlation with BW and reproductive status. Females had a significantly higher prevalence of LASM than males (36% vs. 21.8%, p = 0.046). Maltese dogs in Taiwan have a very high prevalence and an early development of MVD as compared to other small breed dogs, similar to MVD in CKCS in other countries. Since we only recruited asymptomatic Dogs, this study may underestimate the prevalence of MVD in the whole Maltese population. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document the high prevalence of MVD in Taiwanese Maltese.The Maltese may be a new canine model for genetic, pathology, and natural history studies in MVD.",

Dogs were classified as follow: 0% ACVIM A, 23% ACVIM B1, 9% ACVIM B2, 59% ACVIM C and 9% ACVIM D. While the 73% of the dogs were normoazotemic (sCr < 1,4 mg/dl), 16% were staged in IRIS 2, 11% in IRIS 3 and 0%in IRIS 4. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 7.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). A p value <0,05 was considered significant. The prevalence of CKD associated with azotemia in dogs affected by CVHD was 27%. There was a statistically significant direct correlation between ACVIM and IRIS class (Pearson test p = 0.0114). Unexpectedly, the 58% of dogs receiving drugs for medical management of heart failure (ACVIM class C and D) were normoazotemic. Despite a definite conclusion about the role of CVHD on the induction and/or progression of CKD cannot be drawn from this cross\u2010sectional study, these results suggest that there is a direct correlation between the severity of CKD and CVHD.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a new dietetic weight management food (NDWMF)* in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese, client\u2010owned cats. The objectives were 1) to evaluate weight loss parameters in cats fed the NDWMF* and 2) to describe the owner's perception of the cat's quality of life. Overweight/obese, otherwise healthy, client\u2010owned cats (>3/5 body condition score \u2010 BCS) were enrolled in the study (n = 132). Initial veterinary evaluation comprised a physical examination, nutritional assessment, determination of ideal body weight (IBW), and development of weight loss feeding plan. Daily energy requirement (DER) for weight loss was calculated as DER = 0.8 x (70 x IBWkg0.75). Initial and follow\u2010up evaluations (monthly for 6 months) consisted in determination of body weight (BW), BCS, body fat index (BFI), muscle condition score (MCS), and current feeding practices. Quality of life assessment by owners included cat's level of energy, happiness, appetite, begging behavior, flatulence, stool volume, and fecal score. Statistical analysis encompassed scatterplots, regression analysis, summary statistics as appropriate for the type of analyses (continuous or categorical variables, distribution), a mixed model ANOVA was used to assess changes over time (statistical significance at p < 0.05). Eighty three percent of the cats (n = 110) lost weight with an average weight loss of 11% (SEM, 1.8%) over 6 months and an average weekly weight loss rate of 0.45% (SEM, 0.03%). A significant decrease in BCS from week 12\u201024 and in BFI from week 8\u201024 compared to baseline was observed. MCS did not change. Average duration of weight loss was 134 days (SEM, 4.8 days) with 32 days (SEM, 0.5 days) between visits. Fourteen percent of cats achieved IBW (0.14, CI: 0.08\u20100.22). Seventy nine percent of cats ate more than the recommended DER (median fed above DER=6%), and the majority of these cats still lost weight. Owners perceived a significant increase in energy and happiness (>week 12) compared to baseline in the cats that lost weight without changes in appetite or begging behavior. No significant changes were seen in scores for flatulence, stool volume, and fecal score. In conclusion, this clinical study showed that feeding the NDWMF* to client\u2010owned, overweight/obese cats resulted in weight loss. Owners reported significant improvements in cat's quality of life without negative side effects.",

In humans, activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis develops in all type of ascites and it is also associated with signs of systemic fibrinolysis.These results have lead to the suggestion that ascitic fluid is inherently fibrinolytic. Preliminary studies showed similar results also in dogs (JAVMA Nov. 2012, ECVIM proceedings 2013). In addition, in an old experimental study conducted in dogs, inoculation of blood or of a solution containing fibrinogen and thrombin into the pleural cavity resulted in the activation of the coagulation system followed by fibrinolysis. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine whether the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis (i.e. low fibrinogen and elevated FDPs and D\u2010dimer) occurs not only in the ascitic fluid, as alredy been demonstrated, but also in all type of pleural effusions in dogs. Thirty\u2010three dogs referred to the San Marco Veterinary Clinic with pleural effusion, but without ascites, were studied. Fibrinogen, FDPs, and D\u2010dimer concentrations were measured and then compared in both pleural fluid and venous blood via Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The dog's pleural effusions were categorized based on pathophysiology of fluid formation into 5 dogs with transudate (4 due to increased hydrostatic pressure and 1 due to decreased osmotic pressure), 23 with an exudate (of which 11 due to septic causes), 4 with a haemorrhagic pleural effusion, and 4 with a chylous effusions. The fibrinogen concentration in the pleural effusion (median: 59 mg/dL; range: 59\u201059) was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than the plasma fibrinogen concentration (median: 419 mg/dL; range: 131\u20101406). In all dogs, the fibrinogen pleural fluid concentration was lower than the plasma concentration. The FDP concentration in the pleural effusion (median: 151 mg/dL; range: 0.69\u2010151) was significantly (p < 0.0001) higher than plasma FDPs concentrations (median: 5.55 mg/dL; range: 0.83\u2010108.47). In 1 case, the FDPs pleural fluid concentration was lower than the plasma concentration and in 32 cases the pleural fluid concentration was higher. The D\u2010dimer concentrations were significantly(p < 0.0001) higher in the pleural effusion (median: 3.84 \u03bcg/mL; range: 0.05\u20109.61) than in the plasma (median: 0.07 \u03bcg/mL; range: 0.01\u20107.67). In one case, the D\u2010dimer pleural fluid concentration was lower than the plasma concentration and in 32 cases was higher. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of coagulation followed by fibrinolysis occurs in all type of pleural effusions.",

Therefore, elevated FDPs and normal D\u2010dimer are considered an indicator of PHF. In humans and dogs, activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis develops in all type of ascites and it is associated with systemic PHF, suggesting that ascitis is inherently fibrinolytic. Preliminary data have shown that activation of coagulation followed by fibrinolysis occurs also in all type of pleural effusions (PE). The objective of this study was to determine if systemic PHF occurs also in dogs with PE. Thirty\u2010three dogs referred to the San Marco Veterinary Clinic with PE, but without ascites, were studied (group 1). From the electronic data\u2010base of the clinic dogs for inclusion in control groups 2 (healthy dogs) and 3 (sick dogs without PE or ascites) were randomly selected and individually matched to group 1 dogs for age, sex, and breed. Fibrinogen, FDPs, D\u2010dimers, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen/CRP ratio, and prevalence of PHF (i.e., dogs with elevated plasma FDPs and normal D\u2010dimer) were determined. Differences between the 3 groups were analyzed using ANOVA (fibrinogen), Chi\u2010Square (FDPs and prevalence of PHF) and Kruskal\u2010Wallis test (CRP, fibrinogen/CRP ratio, and D\u2010dimer). Post\u2010test analysis were performed by Tamhane and Mann\u2010Whitney test. Fibrinogen concentration in group 1 was significantly increased compared to group 2 (p < 0.0001), but not compared to group 3 (p = 0.504). FDPs concentration in group 1 was significantly increased compared to groups 2 (p < 0.0001), but not compared to group 3 (p = 0.148). D\u2010dimers concentration in group 1 was significantly increased compared to group 2 (p < 0.0001), but not compared to group 3 (p = 0.964). CRP was significantly increased in group 1 compared to group 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001 for both comparison). Fibrinogen/CRP ratio was significantly decreased in group 1 compared to group 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001 for both comparison). Prevalence of PHF was significantly higher in group 1 compared to groups 2 (p = 0.004), but not compared to group 3 (p = 0.186). These results support the hypothesis that PHF occurs significantly more often in dogs with PE compared to healthy dogs. Despite there was a trend of increased PHF also in dogs with PE compared to sick dogs, this difference did not reach significance. Nevertheless, the decreased in fibrinogen/CRP ratio in group 1 compared to group 3, in the face of a similar D\u2010dimer concentration, would suggest that PHF is also more prevalent in dogs with PE compared to sick control dogs.",

Indeed, mood and behaviour modulating properties of thyroid hormones may, in part, be mediated through the interaction of thyroid hormones with neurohormones such as serotonin and prolactin. At present, prospective trials evaluating neurohormonal status or behaviour in hypothyroid dogs before and after thyroid supplementation are lacking. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess behaviour and measure serum serotonin and prolactin concentrations in dogs with spontaneous hypothyroidism before and after treatment.Twenty three client\u2010owned dogs diagnosed with spontaneous primary hypothyroidism were prospectively included in our study. After diagnosis all dogs were treated with levothyroxine (10 micrograms/kg BID). Behaviour of dogs was screened at initial presentation, at 6 weeks and 6 months after initiation of therapy. Owners had to fill in a hard copy of the standardized Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C\u2010BARQ) consisting of 101 scored questions evaluating seven behavioural categories. The average score on all questions was calculated for each dog at each of the three time periods and a paired t\u2010test was used for comparison. Serum serotonin and prolactin concentrations were evaluated at each time period using a commercially validated ELISA kit and heterologous RIA, respectively.Results of the C\u2010BARQ after six weeks of thyroid hormone supplementation when compared with the time zero demonstrated a significant increase (P < 0.05) in excitability, activity and aggression, which most likely became unmasked owing to improved overall activity of dogs. Conversely, at six months period when compared with the time zero no significant changes in any of the behavioural symptoms were observed. Serum serotonin was measured in 18/23 dogs colorimetrically at 450 nm. At time zero, 6 weeks and 6 months serum serotonine was 0.135 (range, 0.075\u20100.337), 0.141 (range, 0,071\u20100.392) and 0.149 (range, 0.086\u20100.378). No significant difference was noted between 6 week and 6 month period comparing to time zero (P = 0.84 and P = 0.37). Serum prolactin concentration measured in 22/23 dogs at time zero, 6 weeks and 6 months was 3.35 ng/ml (range, 1.4\u20106.36), 3.57 ng/ml (range, 1.87\u20107.39) and 3.92 ng/ml (range, 2.01\u201012.92) and did not differ significantly in either time period when compared with time zero (P = 0.99 and P = 0.52).Altogether, results of this study failed to demonstrate a significant role of thyroid supplementation on the majority of evaluated behavioural symptoms as well as neurohormonal status of hypothyroid dogs during 6 months of therapy.",

During the 15\u2010month period from October 2012 to March 2014, we treated 19 cats with iatrogenic hypothyroidism, which had developed 41\u2010323 days (median, 119 days) after treatment with radioiodine (median dose, 100 Mbq).

New or worsening azotemia (>140 \u03bcmol/L) was documented in 16 (84%) and 2 (10.5%) cats, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the serum and urinary concentrations and the urinary fractional excretion of phosphate and calcium in dogs with PDH. Medical records from one referral center were retrospectively evaluated between 2003 and 2013. The diagnosis of PDH was confirmed using the cortisol to creatinine ratio, the LDDS test and/or ACTH stimulation test, the plasma ACTH concentration, ultrasonography of the adrenal glands and computer tomography (CT) of the pituitary and the adrenal glands in dogs with consistent clinical signs. Only newly diagnosed dogs, before treatment for PDH, were evaluated. Two control groups were included: one healthy and one sick control dog (without PDH) for each dog with PDH were included. Healthy control dogs (HCD) and sick control dogs (SCD) were matched for age (\u00b16 months), breed, sex and sexual status. Data were analysed using non\u2010parametric tests and expressed as median and ranges. Significance was set at p < 0.05.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the survival of dogs with the diagnosis adrenocortical insufficiency based on data from a cohort of 525, 028 Swedish client\u2010owned dogs insured in one insurance company (Agria Pet Insurance, Stockholm, Sweden) during the time period 1995\u20102006. Dogs were identified by search for insurance claims with the register code for adrenocortical insufficiency. Dogs were excluded from analysis if they had a previous history of hypercortisolism, and if they were born before begin of the study period. Kaplan\u2010Meier survival analysis was performed. Dogs were regarded as censored when the registered cause of death was other than adrenocortical insufficiency or hypercortisolism that was registered after the first claim for adrenocortical insufficiency. Data from 297 dogs was included. One hundred twenty\u2010four dogs were registered to be dead. In 81 dogs the cause of death was related to the adrenocortical insufficiency. The 1\u2010year estimated survival\u2010rate was 81% (95% CI, 76\u201086%). The 3\u2010year estimated survival\u2010rate was 69% (95% CI, 63\u201076%). The 5\u2010year estimated survival\u2010rate was 59% (95% CI, 51\u201068%). Twelve dogs (4.0%) were still alive after 7 years. In conclusion, the long\u2010term survival of dogs with adrenocortical insufficiency was reasonably good. However, the diseases\u2010related mortality was higher than expected, and occurred mainly during the first years after diagnosis.",

            "text": "The concomitant occurrence of two or more endocrine tumors and/or hyperplasias, known as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is a well\u2010known entity in humans. Multiple gene mutations have been identified. The two major forms are MEN1 and MEN2. In MEN1, the main affected organs are parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary gland. MEN2 occurs in 3 clinical variants: MEN2A, characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B, characterized by MTC, pheochromocytoma and additionally abnormalities; familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. In dogs and cats only a few cases have been reported and it is unknown whether hereditary MEN\u2010like syndromes exist in these species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of multiple endocrine tumors in dogs and cats at our institution, to identify possible breed and sex predispositions and to investigate similarities with the human MEN syndromes. Autopsy reports of dogs and cats from 2004 until 2014 were reviewed. Animals with at least two endocrine tumors/hyperplasias (ETH) were included. Autopsy reports of 951 dogs and 1155 cats were examined. 149 dogs had ETH affecting a single organ, 24 had multiple ETH; 123 cats had single ETH, 21 had multiple ETH. In dogs with multiple ETH, the most common breeds were West Highland White Terrier (WHWT, 3/24), Poodle, Golden Retriever, mixed\u2010breed dogs (each 2/24). 14/24 were male (13 intact); 10/24 were female (10 neutered). Median age was 12 years (range 7\u201018). The most common combination was multiple testicle tumors of various types (4/24). The most common affected organs were the adrenals (18/24). Adrenal cortical adenomas/carcinomas/hyperplasias were mainly associated with pheochromocytomas (3/24), testicle tumors (3/24) and insulinomas (2/24). All 3 WHWTs had adrenal adenomas. Both Poodles had pheochromocytoma associated with pituitary adenoma or adrenal hyperplasia. 2 dogs showed tumor combinations similar to the human MEN1 syndrome: pituitary adenoma and insulinoma; pituitary adenoma and parathyroid hyperplasia. 19/21 cats were domestic short/long hair, 2/21 were Persians. 11/21 were male (7 castrated); 10/21 were female (9 neutered). The median age was 15.5 years (range 10\u201019). The most common affected organs were thyroid glands (18/21), combined mostly with lesions of parathyroid (10/21) and adrenal glands (7/21). None of the cats had combinations similar to the human MEN syndromes. The prevalence of multiple ETH in dogs and cats was 2.5% and 1.8%. MEN\u2010like syndromes were extremely rare in dogs and non\u2010existing in cats. No sex predisposition was observed. Possible breed predispositions need further investigations.",

SBP was not significantly different between the senior and geriatric group. There was no significant effect of obesity or gender on SBP. The platelet count (p = 0.014), total thyroxine concentration (p = 0.008) and the frequency of orthopedic problems (p = 0.007) and cutaneous masses (p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the geriatric compared to the senior dogs.

The most common clinical signs in dogs are stiffness and pain from varying joints. One hallmark of SLE and SLE\u2010related diseases in both dogs and humans is high titres of circulating antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which can be demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) ANA test. Earlier studies have shown that canine IIF ANA positive samples may be divided into two main subgroups: homogenous (ANAH) and speckled (ANAS) IIF ANA fluorescence pattern. In humans, further determination of the specificity of ANA positive sera is frequently employed to characterize the ANA reactivity. Some of these ANA specificities have been demonstrated in man to strongly associate with different systemic autoimmune diseases and also with different IIF ANA staining patterns.

In this pilot study the feasibility of a transcutaneous glomerular filtration rate measurement was investigated. The transcutaneous disappearance rate (expressed as half\u2010life) of fluorescein\u2010isothiocyanate\u2010labelled sinistrin (FITC\u2010S) was measured in three healthy research dogs and three healthy research cats. Plasma clearance of sinistrin (7 data points) was performed in both species as previously described (Res Vet Sci 1998;64:151\u20106 and J Fel Med Surg 2003;5:175\u201081) and half\u2010life was calculated using a 2\u2010compartment model with a freely available pharmacokinetic calculator (Comput Meth Prog Bio 2010;99:306\u201014). Renal elimination of FITC\u2010S was measured transcutaneously for 4 hours (7000\u20108000 data points) using a miniaturized device as described previously for the same purpose in rats (Kidney Int 2011 79:1254\u20108). The procedures were performed in awake, freely moving animals using escalating doses of FITC\u2010S (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) with a wash\u2010out period of at least 24 h in each animal. To find the best position for the device, multiple devices were placed on each animal. The resulting FITC\u2010S disappearance curves were visually assessed to determine the most suitable location and the appropriate dose to reach an adequate transcutaneous peak signal for kinetic analysis. In both species 30 mg/kg were adequate for kinetic calculation. The most suitable place for the device was the lateral thoracic wall in dogs and the ventral abdominal wall in cats, respectively. Transcutaneous FITC\u2010S clearance was then repeated using the optimal dose and location and in parallel with the plasma sinistrin clearance. Plasma sinistrin clearances [ml/kg/min] were 5.5, 5.0 and 3.8 in the three dogs, respectively. Corresponding plasma elimination half\u2010lives [min] were 26, 31 and 35, and corresponding transcutaneous elimination half\u2010lives [min] were 26, 34 and 55, respectively. Plasma sinistrin clearances [ml/kg/min] were 2.8, 2.2 and 1.9 in the three cats, respectively. Corresponding plasma elimination half\u2010lives [min] were 51, 60 and 61, and corresponding transcutaneous elimination half\u2010lives [min] were 75, 96 and 83, respectively. In conclusion, transcutaneous FITC\u2010S clearance is a feasible method for assessment of GFR in awake dogs and cats. It is noninvasive, well tolerated and easy to perform even in a clinical setting with results being readily available. A dose of 30 mg/kg of FITC\u2010S seems adequate for kinetic assessment. Further studies are now needed to establish reference values and evaluate transcutaneous renal clearance in various conditions.",

The aim of this study was to determine secular trends of companion animal urinary tract infection (UTI) that involve extended\u2010spectrum \u03b2\u2010lactamase (ESBL)\u2010 and carbapemenase\u2010 producing Gram negative bacteria (namely, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii), methicillin\u2010resistant\u2010staphylococci (MRS) and ampicillin and high\u2010level\u2010gentamicin\u2010resistance (HLGR) enterococci. Nine hundred and twenty two uropathogenic bacteria were isolated from dogs and cats, between January 1999 and March 2014, at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and at veterinary private practices in the Lisbon area. Isolates were identified using standard commercial systems. Susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. CLSI breakpoints were applied. Extended\u2010spectrum \u03b2\u2010lactamases (ESBL) production was screened by double\u2010disk synergy test. The ESBL, plasmid\u2010mediated AmpC, carbapemenases, mecA and aac(6\u2019)\u2010Ie\u2010aph(2\u2019\u2019)\u2010Ia genes were detected by PCR and gene enzymes were sequenced. Among Enterobacteriaceae 0.7% were DHA\u2010producers, 2.7% were ESBL\u2010producers and 3.6% were CMY\u2010producers. All isolates were also multidrug\u2010 resistant. Cefalosporinases\u2010producer Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 2000, the first being a CMY\u20102\u2010producer E. coli. All the ESBL\u2010producers were E. coli or K. pneumoniae producing CTX\u2010M\u2010group 1 enzymes. The first CTX\u2010M\u201015\u2010producer E. coli was detected in 2003 and in 2004 the pandemic O25b\u2010ST131 human virulent E. coli CTX\u2010M\u201015\u2010producing clone was identified. Resistance to carbapenems was detected only in A. baumanii causing UTI in cats in 2006 (OXA\u201066) and 2009 (OXA\u201023). MRS represented 8.5% of all isolated staphylococci. Detection of methicillin\u2010resistant\u2010 Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred back in 2001 and methicillin\u2010resistant\u2010 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) emerged only in 2007. Ampicillin\u2010resistance in enterococci was present throughout the years (15,4%, n = 8). HLGR appeared in enterococci in 2003 and was confirmed by the detection of the bifunctional enzyme that confers high level resistance to aminoglycosides (7 out of 8 isolates). In this study we showed that in the last decade the emergence of resistance to critically important antimicrobials among uropathogens from companion animals is a concerning fact. The multidrug\u2010resistant Enterobacteriaceae may compromise effective therapeutic options, namely third and fourth generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim/sulpha combinations. The emergence of MRSA/MRSP and HLGR among uropathogens is also a therapeutic challenge. The detection of uropathogens with antimicrobial resistance is not only an animal health issue but also a matter of public health, since companion animals may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria or resistance genes for humans.",

High grade mastocytomas (grade III, Patnaik classification) are characterized by an uncontrolled growth of neoplastic mast cells (MC) and a poor prognosis. Recently, the KIT\u2010targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors masitinib and toceranib have been approved for the treatment of canine MC tumors. These drugs are able to induce responses in mastocytoma patients. However, in many patients, relapses are seen. Therefore, research is focusing on new drug targets. Recently, the transcription factor STAT5 has been reported to play an important role in the proliferation and survival of human neoplastic MC. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the JAK2\u2010STAT5 pathway in canine mastocytomas. To address this aim, the canine mastocytoma cell lines C2 and NI\u20101 as well as inhibitors directed against JAK2 or STAT5 were employed. As assessed by immunocytochemistry, C2 cells and NI\u20101 cells were found to express pSTAT5 in their cytoplasm and nuclei. Intracellular expression of pSTAT5 was confirmed by flow cytometry. Interestingly, C2 cells were found to express higher levels of pSTAT5 compared to NI\u20101 cells. Next, we treated C2 cells and NI\u20101 cells with various concentrations of the STAT5 inhibitors piceatannol and pimozide and the JAK2 inhibitors AZD1480 and TG101348. As assessed by 3H\u2010thymidine uptake, all 4 compounds were found to inhibit the proliferation of canine MC in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Drug effects were found to vary in different cell lines, with the following rank\u2010order of potency (IC50 values): TG101348: 0.1\u20100.75 \u03bcM; pimozide: 0.1\u20102.5 \u03bcM; AZD1480: 1\u20102 \u03bcM; piceatannol: 5\u201050 \u03bcM. To further explore the mechanism of drug\u2010induced inhibition of proliferation, we examined cell cycle progression and apoptosis in drug\u2010exposed cells. Whereas all 4 drugs tested induced only moderate cell cycle arrests in the G1 phase, these drugs were found to induce substantial apoptosis in C2 cells and NI\u20101 cells as evidenced by microscopy and Annexin\u2010V/PI staining. Together, our data show that JAK2\u2010 and STAT5\u2010targeting drugs exert anti\u2010proliferative and apoptosis\u2010inducing effects in canine mastocytoma cells suggesting that this signaling pathway may be a promising new therapeutic target in canine mastocytomas. The clinical relevance of this observation remains to be determined.",

From August 2005 to March 2014, 3801 canine neoplasms were reported to the Danish Veterinary Cancer Registry. The total number of malignant (1788) and benign (1953) were comparable (42% and 46%). Malignant neoplasms totalled 1262, when tumors from areas of distribution with known sex\u2010hormone dependency (reproductive organs, mammary gland, perineal), and cases with unknown area of distribution were excluded. The overall distribution of malignant neoplasia was 481 (38%) intact male dogs, 157 (12.5%) neutered male dogs, 404 (32%) intact female dogs and 220 (17.5%) neutered female dogs. The distribution was even between male and female dogs (50.5% and 49.5%). Compared to a known standard population of dogs, there was an overall statistically significant association of malignant neoplasia with neuter status in both sexes. For both genders this was significant for lymphoma, mast cell tumors and osteosarcomas,. For neutered females, but not males, there was increased risk of hemangiosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.

Infected cats show upper respiratory tract disease (URTD; defined herein as presence of sneezing, nasal\u2010 and/or ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and/or keratitis), but also oral cavity lesions, chronic stomatitis, limping syndrome and, rarely, virulent systemic disease. The aims of the present study were to compare cats suspected of FCV (FCV\u2010SC) based on clinical symptoms and healthy controls (controls) and to investigate potential risk and protective factors, such as co\u2010infection with feline herpesvirus\u20101 (FHV\u20101), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and feline retroviruses, vaccination, gender, age, breed, housing and corticosteroid and antibiotic treatment. Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs from 200 FCV\u2010SC and 100 controls were collected into transport medium, processed within 96 hours after collection and analyzed for FCV by virus isolation and for all tested pathogens using molecular assays. The samples were collected by randomly selected veterinary practices in 20 different areas of Switzerland (10 FCV\u2010SC and 5 controls/area). To record clinical data, retroviral status and vaccination history of the cats, a questionnaire was filled out by the private veterinarian. The seven tested pathogens were found in the investigated population. The prevalence (FCV\u2010SC vs. controls) was: FCV 45% vs. 8%; FHV\u20101 20% vs. 9%, C. felis 8% vs. 1%, B. bronchiseptica 4% vs. 2%, M. felis 48% vs. 31%, Feline leukemia virus 2% vs. 1% and Feline immunodeficiency virus 2% vs. 1%. FCV\u2010SC were positive for FCV significantly more often compared with controls (OR 9.2) and shed more FCV. Co\u2010infections with up to four pathogens were detected; FCV\u2010SC were significantly more frequently co\u2010infected (40%) compared with controls (14%). Gingivostomatitis and oral ulceration but not URTD were highly associated with FCV infection. In contrast, C. felis was associated with URTD; FHV\u20101 was associated with nasal and ocular discharge and M. felis with conjunctivitis and ocular discharge. Risk factors for FCV infection were housing in groups (especially \u22654 cats), an intact gender, Maine Coon breed and corticosteroid therapy. FCV\u2010positive cats with gingivostomatitis were older and more commonly vaccinated than FCV\u2010positive cats without gingivostomatitis. Moreover they shed more FCV than cats with URTD. Vaccination and primary immunization defined as two vaccinations 2\u20106 weeks apart with the same vaccine brand were protective factors against FCV but not FHV\u20101 infection. Vaccination was associated with a decreased incidence of URTD in FCV\u2010infected cats (OR 0.3). Further analyses will investigate cross\u2010neutralization patterns of the prevailing FCV isolates.",

Recent evidence suggests that bartonellosis also causes lameness and polyarthritis in dogs. However, PCR amplification of Bartonella DNA and isolation of Bartonella species from canine synovial fluid (SF) samples have rarely been reported. Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) due to Leishmania infantum is a multisystemic disease commonly associated with polyarthritis. Based on the hypothesis that concurrent Bartonella infection may be a contributing factor for the development of arthritis in dogs with CanL, the main objective of this study was to investigate the microbiological and molecular prevalence of Bartonella spp. in dogs with naturally\u2010occurring CanL, with or without cytologically documented arthritis. From a previous study, 38 dogs with CanL were retrospectively studied for Bartonella spp. infection. Diagnosis of CanL was based on compatible clinical and clinicopathological abnormalities, positive serology, and lymph node or bone marrow (BM) cytology. Dogs with serological evidence of other vector\u2010borne infections (anaplasmosis, borelliosis, dirofilariosis and ehrlichiosis) and dogs recently vaccinated or medicated were excluded from the study. Arthritis defined as a neutrophil percentage in excess of 10% of nucleated cells in SF cytology was documented in 31/38 (81.6%) of dogs. A total of 74 archived specimens from 38 dogs, including 33 EDTA\u2010anticoagulated blood samples, 19 BM and 22 SF aspirates were tested for Bartonella spp. DNA using a Bartonella alpha proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) diagnostic platform. Eight (21.1%) dogs were infected with one or two Bartonella species, including Candidatus Bartonella merieuxii(n = 5), B. henselae SA2 (n = 3) and B. rochalimae (n = 1). Bartonella spp. DNA was amplified from BM in 4 dogs and from blood in 3 dogs but was not amplified from any SF sample. Overall, 6 (19.4%) dogs with and 2 (28.6%) dogs without arthritis were infected with a Bartonella species. The prevalence of Bartonella spp. DNA in the dogs with or without arthritis did not differ (\u03c72 test for independence, P = 0.589). These results indicate that a subset of dogs with CanL is co\u2010infected with various Bartonella species, including B. henselae, B. rochalimae and Candidatus Bartonella merieuxii. Future studies are warranted to determine if Bartonella spp. infections contribute to the occurrence of L. infantum\u2010associated arthritis or other clinical manifestations.",

Therefore, we applied this novel technique for the first time to study preprandial and postprandial gallbladder volume in 10 healthy mixed\u2010breed dogs and compared the results to two\u2010dimensional (2D) ultrasonography. The dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency to obtain ultrasonographic measurements of the gallbladder.

However, recent studies emphasized the effect of body position and used limb on SAP measurement. The aim of this study was to determine whether a difference existed in SAP measured simultaneously in dogs using different limbs, with two Doppler units by two different operators. Sixty client\u2010owned dogs, admitted to the veterinary hospital for different reason, were enrolled. They were divided in 3 groups based on body size: 20 small breed dogs (<15 kg); 20 medium breed (15\u201030 kg); 20 large breed (> 30 kg). For each dog the anxiety status was recorded. SAP was measured via Doppler technique when dogs were in right lateral recumbency in a quite environment. Right and left forelimb SAP and left forelimb and left hindlimb SAP were recorded simultaneously, with two identical Doppler units equipped with headphones, by two operators. Measurement was performed based on the ACVIM guidelines. Five measurements were recorded, the higher and lower values were discarded from the analysis. The relationship of mean SAP for each limb with body weight, sex, anxiety status and SAP value was evaluated. Mean \u00b1 SD SAP was significantly higher for the right forelimb (175.81 \u00b1 37.15) compare to the left forelimb (165.14 \u00b1 33.35) on overall population. The difference was significant for large breed dogs, males and dogs with SAP \u00b3 180 mmHg. SAP was higher for the left forelimb (163.67 \u00b1 32.11) compare to the left hindlimb (151.34 \u00b1 34.31) on overall population. The difference was significant for medium and large breed dogs, females, calm animals and dogs with SAP \u00b3 180 mmHg. The mean SAP from the left forelimb recorded by two different operators at two different moments, were compared and no difference was evident. In conclusion, SAP measurement from different limbs, in dogs in right lateral recumbency, is poorly correlated. Measurement of SAP from the left forelimb is more repeatable during time and between different operators. SAP trend monitoring should be done using the same measurement site for any animal.",

However, there is no available and reliable method to evaluate the severity and prognosis of the disease. Ninety\u2010two cats diagnosed as pancreatitis with acute onset of compatible clinical signs and a positive SNAP\u00ae fPL\u2122 Test between October 2011 and September 2013 were enrolled in this study. All Cats were divided into survival (n = 48) and non\u2010survival (n = 44) groups. Fifty\u2010two parameters including signalments, clinical signs, physical examinations, clinicopathological examinations, diagnostic images, complications and concurrent diseases were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Parameters with P \u2264 0.05 were considered for further analyses. The mortality in this study was 47.8%. Hematocrit, albumin, BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, calcium, phosphorous, body temperature, systolic blood pressure, the body cavity fluids, complications, e.g. systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute renal failure (ARF) were found to be significantly associated with disease severity and prognosis, and were selected for constructing the scores. Continuous variables outside the reference interval were separated into quartiles to yield quartile\u2010specific odds ratios (ORs) for survival. Based on the integer value of the OR, the scoring system was then developed by incorporating weighting factors assigned to each quartile. A predictive total score was calculated for each cat by summing all weighting factors. The total scores of each cat ranged from 12 to 83. The severity scores in this study achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.88. The optimal cut\u2010off point for discriminating outcome was 32.5 with the sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 77.3%, respectively. The mortality was 87.2% with a score \u2265 33, whereas 18.9% with a score \u2264 32. There was significant difference (P < 0.001) between the two groups of the cut\u2010off point. Furthermore, the mortality reached to 100% when the score more than 56.

To our knowledge, the presense of MMP\u20102 and \u20109 has not been studied in the intestinal mucosal samples of healthy dogs as well as in canine spontaneous IBD. Thus, the main aim of this study was to identify the presence of MMP\u20102 and \u20109 in the mucosa of the small and large intestines of clinically healthy beagle dogs using gelatin zymography technique. For the study, historical intestinal tissue samples from four different parts of the intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon) were used. The samples were taken and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen during necropsy from 12 healthy laboratory beagle dogs after being euthanized when finishing unrelated long\u2010term trials studying canine intestinal microbiota.",

The hematocrit was significantly (P = 0.003) lower in the group of dogs with a murmur (mean 30.9%, standard deviation 2.8%) compared to the group without a murmur (mean 32.2%, standard deviation 3.1%).

The SNAP Feline proBNP Test uses the same biological reagents as the Cardiopet proBNP Test but provides results in 10 minutes. We sought to prospectively validate the assay in a population of clinically normal cats. Cats were recruited based upon the absence of a heart murmur, gallop, and/or arrhythmia. All cats received physical examination, non\u2010invasive blood pressure measurement, complete biochemical analysis including a T4, urinalysis and echocardiogram. Only cats considered free of underlying cardiac or systemic disease were enrolled. Sixteen adult cats were enrolled and blood samples were obtained for NT\u2010proBNP concentrations at 0, 2 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 10 hr. Samples were placed in EDTA tubes and centrifuged within one hour and split into two tubes for duplicate samples at each time point and stored at \u201080\u00b0C. Once all samples were collected, they were shipped on dry ice overnight and run in one batch (IDEXX Laboratories) for measurement of NT\u2010proBNP concentrations. SNAP tests were visually evaluated by one blinded reader. Comparison of SNAP assay vs. quantitative ELISA revealed a 1.0 (AUC) degree of correlation between assays, and that a positive SNAP test result was associated with a NT\u2010proBNP concentration of 126.4pmol/L or greater. The average BNP concentration of abnormal cats (191.1 \u00b1 5.8) determined by the SNAP assay was significantly greater than the normal (26.4 \u00b1 1.2).",

Pulmonary hypertension (PH), a severe co\u2010morbid condition with a challenging diagnosis, may develop in CIPF dogs. The ratio between the right pulmonary vein and pulmonary artery (PV/PA) has been described as an echocardiographic indicator of PH in CIPFdogs. This study was intended to investigate whether CT\u2010scan angiography cardiac findings are 1) altered in dogs with cIPF compared to healthy control dogs and 2) correlated with PV/PA measured by echocardiography (PV/PAUS). Thoracic CTA images from 6 WHWT with CIPF (Group A) and 9 healthy controls from various breeds (Group B) were retrospectively reviewed by one observer. All measurements were obtained in transverse post\u2010contrast images displayed in a soft tissue window. PV and PA were measured dorsal to the right atrium, perpendicular to the long axis of these vessels. In addition, pulmonary trunk (PT) was assessed just ventral to the division of pulmonary arteries, perpendicular to its long axis. Ascending aorta (Ao) was also measured perpendicular to its long axis. Transverse reformatted images were obtained to have a view equivalent to the standard 4 chambers\u2010echocardiographic view where right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) were measured. Three ratios were calculated PV/PACT, PT/Ao and RV/LV, compared between groups and correlated with PV/PAUS in both bi\u2010dimensional (BD) and M\u2010modes (MM). Statistical analyses were performed with XLStat\u00ae software. Values are given as mean \u00b1 sd. Statistical significance was set at a P \u2264 0.05. PV/PACT was lower in group A (0.64 \u00b1 0.18) in comparison to group B (1.00 \u00b1 0.23, P = 0.008) and correlated with PV/PAUS (BD: r = 0.796, P = 0.001; MM: r = 0.730, P = 0.003). PT/Ao was higher in group A (1.18 \u00b1 0.08) compared to group B (0.92 \u00b1 0.14, P = 0.001) and correlated only with PV/PAUS measured in BD mode (r = \u20100.623, P = 0.02). The RV/LV ratio was increased in group A (0.91 \u00b1 0.11) in comparison to group B (0.70 \u00b1 0.08, P = 0.001) and a correlation between RV/LV and PV/PAUS was found (BD: r = \u20100.726, P = 0.005; MM: r = \u20100.657, P = 0.01). In conclusion, in WHWT with CIPF, PV/PACT, PT/Ao and RV/LV ratios measured on thoracic CTA images are correlated with PV/PAUS and may serve in the assessment of PH.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a new dietetic weight management food (NDWMF)* in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese, client\u2010owned dogs, under typical household conditions. The objectives were 1) to evaluate weight loss parameters in dogs fed a NDWMF* and 2) to assess the owner's perception of the dog's quality of life. Overweight/obese, otherwise healthy, client\u2010owned dogs (>3/5 body condition score \u2010 BCS) were enrolled in the study (n = 162). Initial veterinary evaluation included physical examination, nutritional assessment, determination of ideal body weight (IBW), and development of weight\u2010loss feeding guidelines. Daily energy requirement (DER) for weight loss was calculated as DER = 70 x IBWkg0.75. Initial and follow\u2010up evaluations (monthly for 6 months) encompassed determination of body weight, BCS, body fat index (BFI), muscle condition score (MCS), and feeding practices. Quality of life assessment by owners included dog's level of energy, happiness, appetite, begging behavior, flatulence, stool volume, and fecal score. Statistical analysis comprised scatterplots, regression analysis, summary statistics as appropriate for the type of analyses performed (continuous or categorical variables, distribution), and a mixed model ANOVA to assess changes over time (with statistical significance at p < 0.05). Ninety four percent of the dogs lost weight (n = 153) with an average weight loss of 14.5% (SEM, 1.1%) over 6 months and an average weekly weight\u2010loss rate of 0.73% (SEM, 0.04%). The mean duration of weight loss was 127 days (SEM, 4.3 days) with an average of 33 days (SEM, 0.7 days) between rechecks. Thirty nine percent of dogs achieved IBW (0.39, CI: 0.31\u20100.48). Fifty five percent of dogs ate more calories from NDWMF* than the recommended DER for weight loss (median fed above DER=8%) and 94% of these dogs (0.94, CI: 0.87\u20100.98) still lost weight. Thirty six percent of dogs received treats. BCS and BFI decreased significantly over time compared to baseline. Owners perceived a significant increase in energy and happiness in the dogs that lost weight without changes in appetite or begging behavior. In conclusion, this clinical study confirmed the effectiveness of the NDWMF* in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese client\u2010owned dogs in spite of higher than recommended caloric intake. Owners reported significant improvements in dog's quality of life without negative side effects.",

            "text": "Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease that mainly occurs in the West Highland white terrier (WHWT) breed. The CIPF diagnosis commonly relies on thoracic high\u2010resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings and ultimately on histopathology. As those tests are not easily performed in practice, identification of measurable markers of fibrosis, that might help to diagnose and/or monitor the course of CIPF, is helpful. VEGF is an angiogenic regulator involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In human IPF, serum VEGF concentration has been shown to be higher in IPF patients compared to healthy volunteers and may reflect the severity of the lung disease. The aims of the present study were (1) to investigate the potential role of VEGF as a peripheral blood biomarker in CIPF; and (2) to investigate possible breed\u2010related differences in basal VEGF concentration, that might explain the high predisposition of the WHWT breed for CIPF.Therefore, VEGF was determined by ELISA (Canine VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit, R&D systems) in the serum of 14 WHWT with CIPF confirmed by HRCT and/or histopathology (median age 11 years, range 5\u201014), 18 healthy WHWT (9, 3\u201017), and 85 healthy dogs of other breeds, including: 14 Scottish terrier (ST) (5, 1\u201010), 16 Jack Russell terrier (JRT) (7, 1\u201012), 15 Maltese (6, 1\u201013), 14 King Charles Spaniel (KCS) (6, 1\u201010), 12 Labrador Retriever (LR) (6, 2\u201012) and 14 Malinois Belgian Shepherd (6, 2\u20108). Health status was based on clinical examination, serum biochemistry and haematology in all healthy dogs and a thoracic HRCT was performed in 9/18 healthy WHWT. The Khi\u00b2 test with the threshold 5% was used for the statistical analysis (XLStat\u00ae software). Eight CIPF WHWT (57%) have serum VEGF concentrations above the kit detection limit (39.1 pg/ml) compared to 1 WHWT (0.05%) in the group of healthy dogs (P = 0.001). Concerning inter\u2010breed differences in healthy dogs, most values obtained were below the kit detection limit with only 3 KCS (21%), 3 JRT (19%), 3 LR (25%) and 1 ST (7%) having VEGF serum levels above 39.1 pg/ml (P = 0.147). Results of the present study show that (1) VEGF might be an interesting blood biomarker for CIPF; (2) canine VEGF Quantikine Elisa kit is not appropriate for measurement of serum VEGF levels in healthy canine populations.",

In order to determine whether the mutation causes FVII deficiency also in this breed, we recruited 6 littermates and their mother. None of these WSS had shown an increased hemorrhagic tendency, but affecteds bled excessively following blood collection. We found that the 3 homozygous affected dogs of the litter exhibited markedly prolonged prothrombin time but normal partial thromboplastin time. They also had drastically reduced FVII activities but normal to high FVIII and FIX activities compared to their littermate controls.

While there is only a mild hemorrhagic tendency, bleeding dogs could be treated with fresh frozen or cryo\u2010poor plasma or human recombinant FVIIa. This preliminary study indicates a high carrier frequency in WSS. Screening by new platform DNA methods for this and other ancestral defects is helpful to detect additional hereditary diseases and genetic predispositions in different breeds, while other mutations are new and restricted to one or related breeds.",

Information on the signalment and complete blood cell count of all dogs with normal red and white blood cell parameters judged by existing reference intervals was extracted from a veterinary database; similar information was collected from all dogs with normal serum biochemical profiles, considering all parameters other than glucose as inclusion criteria. Normal haematological profiles were available for 6046 dogs, 5447 of which also had machine platelet concentrations within the reference interval; normal serum biochemical profiles were available from 3045 dogs, 1495 of which also had accompanying normal serum glucose concentrations. For the haematological data, 75 pure breeds plus a mixed breed control group were represented by 10 or more dogs, while for the serum biochemical data, 60 pure breeds plus a mixed breed control group were represented by 10 or more individuals. All measured haematological parameters except mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and all serum biochemical analytes except sodium, chloride and glucose, varied with age. Concentrations of white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets, but not red blood cell parameters, all varied with sex, as did total protein, globulin, potassium, chloride, creatinine, cholesterol, total bilirubin, and activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), amylase and lipase. Neutering status had an impact on haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), MCHC, and concentrations of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets, as well as all serum biochemical analytes except albumin, sodium, calcium, urea and glucose. Principal component analysis (PCA) of haematological data revealed 37 pure breeds with distinctive phenotypes, while PCA of serum biochemical data revealed over 50 pure breeds with distinctive phenotypes. Furthermore, all haematological parameters except MCHC and all serum biochemical analytes except urea and glucose showed significant differences between specific individual breeds and the mixed breed group. Twenty\u2010nine breeds had distinctive haematological phenotypes and 21 breeds had distinctive serum biochemical phenotypes when assessed in this way. Tentative breed\u2010specific reference intervals were generated for breeds with a distinctive phenotype identified by comparative analysis. This study represents the first large\u2010scale analysis of haematological and serum biochemical phenotypes in the dog and underlines the important potential of this species in the elucidation of genetic determinants of haematological and biochemical traits, triangulating phenotype, breed and genetic predisposition, as well as the urgent need for breed\u2010specific reference intervals in clinical practice.",

Over the following 12 hours the cat developed central blindness, tremors, intermittent seizures and opisthotonus. Repeat blood sampling revealed a marked hypoglycaemia (0.8 mmol/L). An insulin level (performed on serum obtained while the cat was hypoglycaemic) was inappropriately elevated (10938 pmol/L; reference range 72 \u2010 583 pmol/L). An intravenous bolus of 5% glucose resulted in rapid resolution of all clinical signs and mild transient hyperglycaemia (12.5 mmol/L). Despite frequent feeding, the hypoglycaemia (2.0 mmol/L) recurred, so an intravenous glucose continuous rate infusion was commenced. An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable, although three cranial mesenteric lymph nodes were noted to be prominent (3 mm in width). An exploratory laparotomy revealed a firm and erythematous left limb of the pancreas. The body and right limb of the pancreas appeared grossly normal. Following surgical resection of the left limb of the pancreas, the cat returned to a euglycaemic state after a brief rebound hyperglycaemia. Histopathology revealed pancreatic fibrosis with marked multifocal micronodular hyperplasia of exocrine and endocrine cells, mild lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and ductular ectasia. Synaptophysin immunohistochemistry confirmed nodular beta cell hyperplasia. Mild granulomatous lymphadenitis and hydropic change within hepatocytes was also noted. The cat recovered uneventfully without any further intervention. It gained weight and remained euglycaemic over the following six months.",

Therefore the aim of the study was to evaluate the cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratio as an additional diagnostic marker for HAC in dogs. To achieve this aim, a reference range of this ratio depending on the sex should be evaluated in healthy dogs and compared with dogs having a HAC. In 55 healthy dogs (age: 1 \u2010 11.4 years) and in 20 dogs with HAC (age: 7.1 \u2010 14.6 years) of different breeds the plasma concentration of cortisol (Immulite System, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) and DHEA (Beckman Coulter) was measured and the ratio was calculated. All dogs were patients of the Small Animal Clinic except five of the healthy dogs which were recruited from the Institute of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmacy of the University. With these data the cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratio was calculated for male dogs (healthy dogs n = 18; dogs with HAC n = 3), neutered males (healthy dogs n = 9; dogs with HAC n = 5), female dogs (healthy dogs n = 21; dogs with HAC n = 5) and spayed females (healthy dogs n = 7; dogs with HAC n = 7). The statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat. The plasma cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratio of healthy male dogs was the lowest ratio of all sexual categories (mean average 84.8 \u00b1 128) and it differed significantly to all other sexes (neutered males = 231 \u00b1 138, P = 0.002; females = 244 \u00b1 124, P < 0.001 and spayed females (183 \u00b1 60.0, P = 0.006). The cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratio showed no significant difference between male and female dogs with HAC. Spayed females with HAC had significantly higher cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratios (501 \u00b1 310) than healthy spayed females (P = 0.035) but no significant differences were found in other sexual categories. This preliminary data indicates that the cortisol\u2010DHEA\u2010ratio might not be a very promising tool for the diagnosis of HAC. In addition, the significant gender\u2010dependency of this parameter has to be considered and may generally limit its clinical usefulness.

It is thought that activins may be the key intermediary in TGF\u2010\u03b21 mediated fibrotic response. Activin A has been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but studies regarding the role of activin B are still spares. Canine IPF (CIPF) is a chronic, incurable interstitial lung disease occurring particularly in West Highland White Terriers (WHWTs). During the disease course, acute exacerbations (AEs), with poor prognosis, can occur. Histopathologically AEs of CIPF are featured by diffuse alveolar damage, which is also a key feature in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our objective was to study the expression of activin A and B by immunohistochemistry in the lung tissue of CIPF WHWTs (n = 5), CIPF WHWTs with concurrent AE (n = 4), and dogs of various breeds with ARDS (n = 4), and to compare these findings to healthy WHWTs (n = 3). In addition, western blot analysis of activin B from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of CIPF WHWTs (n = 6) and healthy WHWTs (n = 6) was conducted. We demonstrated that activin B, but not activin A, is strongly expressed in the altered alveolar epithelium in lungs of diseased WHWTs as well as in ARDS lungs. Furthermore, activin B was detected in BALF of CIPF WHWTs, most notably in samples from dogs with AE, but not in BALF of healthy WHWTs. This novel finding suggests that activin B participates in the pathophysiology of CIPF and might act as a potential marker of alveolar epithelial damage.",

Approximately one third of Swedish dogs are insured by Agria and the insurance database is a validated tool for epidemiological studies. Assessment of morbidity was based on veterinary care events. Disease diagnoses were grouped in both general and specific disease categories. Individual diagnoses that were likely to represent IMRD were combined. Morbidity was defined as incidence rates and presented as number of cases per 10 000 dog years at risk (DYAR). Relative risk (RR) for NSDTRs compared to other breeds combined was calculated. The study included 445 336 dogs, 2890 were NSDTRs. The most common general causes of veterinary care for NSDTRs were injuries followed by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders with significant increased risk (RRs between 1.2 and 1.3) for NSDTRs compared to other breeds. The highest relative risk for NSDTRs was for systemic lupus erythematosus (RR 19.0). Compared to other breeds, NSDTRs had an increased risk for SRMA (RR 11.5) and IMRD (RR 11.8) with an incidence rate of 19.6 cases per 10 000 DYAR for SRMA and 8.8 cases per 10 000 DYAR for IMRD. The incidence rate for SRMA and IMRD in NSDTRs were also compared to dogs of other retriever breeds. The comparison revealed that NSDTRs also had a significant increased risk for both SRMA (RR 20.8) and IMRD (RR 10.1) when compared to other retrievers only. This study is the first to investigate the morbidity for IMRD in NSDTRs, which is important for further research and breeding practice. For several reasons the incidence rates might be underestimated and exact numbers should be interpreted with caution. However underestimation of incidence rates should not differ between dogs of different breeds, therefore not affecting the risk calculations. It can be concluded that NSDTRs are predisposed to the diseases SRMA and IMRD with an increased risk compared to other breeds and to other retrievers.",

To investigate the causes of anemia, 3174 anemic cases (PCV< 37%) collected between January 2008 and December 2012 at National Taiwan University Veterinary Hospital (NTUVH) were analyzed. Most dogs (72.1%, n = 2889) presented with a mild form (25%\u2266PCV<37%), which was followed by a moderate form (15%\u2266PCV<25%; 20.8%, n = 660) and a severe form (PCV<15%; 7.1%, n = 225). Among the 2037 dogs with identifiable causes, 70.4% (1435 dogs) were induced by single cause, whereas 29.6% (602 dogs) by multiple causes. Neoplasia\u2010related anemia (n = 460), infectious pathogens\u2010related anemia (n = 287), renal disease\u2010related anemia (n = 251) and post\u2010surgery/ trauma\u2010related anemia (n = 182) account for 32.1, 20.0, 17.6 and 12.7% of single\u2010cause cases, respectively.

Severe anemia primarily resulted from infectious disease\u2010related anemia (61.8%), followed by IMHA (11.4%), and tumor\u2010related anemia (11.4%). Of the 76 infectious disease\u2010related severe anemic dogs, the most common diagnosed pathogen was Babesia gibsoni (88.2%, n = 67), followed by Ehrlichia canis (6.6%, n = 5)and Babesia canis (3.9%, n = 3). Taken together, tumors, infectious diseases, and renal failure are the most frequently causes of canine anemia in Taiwan, furthermore, B. gibsoni appeared to be the most important infectious pathogen causing severe anemia which may be associated with the climate in this geographical area.",

Impaired renal function is observed in 50% of dogs with heart failure. Altered renal hemodynamics due to decreased cardiac output results in renal hypoperfusion, and resultant elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, defined as azotemia. Azotemia is a prognostic factor in dogs with mitral regurgitation, therefore, preservation and/or restoration of renal function is thought to improve prognosis. Medical treatment for heart failure, however, includes angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and loop diuretics, which has been shown to increase the risk of developing azotemia. We hypothesized that mitral valve repair surgery ameliorates renal function by improvement of systemic hemodynamics. The change in renal function in dogs with mitral regurgitation was assessed by evaluating time\u2010dependent changes in glomelular filtration rate by inulin clearance before and after cardiac surgery. Eighteen dogs with severe mitral regurgitation with azotemia (plasma urea nitrogen level > 28 mg/dL, plasma creatinine level >1.9 mg/dL) were included in this study. The glomerular filtration rate in all dogs were evaluated by determining inulin clearance before and 3 months after surgery. Serum atrial natriuretic peptide level, plasma NT\u2010pro brain natriuretic peptide level, plasma urea nitrogen concentration, and plasma creatinine concentration were measured at each time point as well as during the initial staging of heart failure based on the International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC). Left atrial/aorta ratio by echocardiography and vertebral heart size by thoracic radiographs were also measured. Glomerular filtration rate significantly increased 3 months after surgery (40.0 ml/min/m2 [25.6 \u2010 123.0], 2.7 ml/min/kg [1.0 \u2010 5.3]) compared to before surgery (38.4 ml/min/m2 [12.6 \u2010 50.3], 2.2 ml/min/kg [0.7 \u2010 3.8]) (P < 0.05). The ISACHC stage of heart failure was improved at 3 months after surgery compared to before surgery. In addition, serum atrial natriuretic peptide level, plasma NT\u2010pro brain natriuretic peptide level, plasma urea nitrogen concentration, LA/Ao and VHS significantly decreased after surgery (P < 0.05). The use of diuretics decreased after mitral valve repair surgery and consequently, a decrease in plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were observed. Therefore, this suggests that the main cause of azotemia in dogs with mitral regurgitation may be due to inadequate renal blood flow and exacerbation by the use of diuretics.",

Infected macrophages can cause injury in different organs, including the kidney. CVL is known as a common cause of glomerulonephritis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate and characterize the renal lesions in dogs seropositive for Leishmania sp. in Brazil. This project was approved by the animal ethics committee of UECE, Brazil. Twenty adult dogs seropositive for CVL from Center for Zoonosis Control were randomly selected for this experiment. CVL was diagnosed by immunofluorescence and ELISA. Urine and blood sampling and kidney harvesting were performed immediately after euthanasia. Urinalysis and serum creatinine levels were evaluated. Hematoxilin and eosin stained kidneys were assessed by a pathologist in a blind fashion. Dogs were classified into four stages according to the International renal interest society staging system for chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on serum creatinine concentrations. The most frequent histopathological changes observed was mild interstitial fibrosis in 55% (11/20) and glomerulosclerosis and chronic multifocal lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis in 70% (14/20) of the dogs. Urinalysis showed the presence of proteinuria (70%), casts (55%), hematuria (30%) and bacteriuria (15%). Twelve dogs were classified in the stage 1 of CKD, five in stage 2, two in stage 3 and only one in stage 4. Regarding the histopathologic changes, 95% (19/20) had at least one glomerular lesion. Glomerulosclerosis (35%) and multifocal glomerulonephritis (15%), glomerular fibrosis (20%) and thickening of Bowman's capsule (15%) were also observed. One dog showed only tubular and interstitial lesions. An expressive renal impairment and signs of chronic injury such as fibrotic areas were also observed, even in the animals in stage 1 of CKD. The glomerular thickening observed in animals with CVL is due to deposition of proteinaceous material or antibodies. The histopathological changes observed in this study demonstrated a significant renal involvement in dogs with CVL. This result indicates that the glomerulonephritis is a common sequelae related to leishmaniasis infection. Even dogs in stage 1 of CKD showed significant renal histopathological changes. Animals infected with Leishmania sp. may have severe renal damage and risk of progressive chronic kidney disease even when no increase of creatinine levels or proteinuria is detected.",

Hemoplasmosis (\u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\u2019 [CMhm] n = 11, Mycoplasma hemofelis [Mhf] n = 3, species not determined n = 3) was diagnosed in 17 anemic cats (age 0.6\u201016 years, median 8; hematocrit 0.05\u20100.25 l/l, median 0.16) between 2005 and 2013. Seven of the cats (CMhm [5], Mhf [1], species not determined [1]) had concurrent disease, whilst 10 cats (CMhm [6], Mhf [2], species not determined [2]) did not. All 17 cats underwent antibiotic treatment (doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone); 12 cats received blood transfusions and/or Oxyglobin\u00ae. Three cats were euthanatized within 11 days due to concurrent disease (FIV, pancreatitis/cholangitis) or financial constraints, one cat due to persistent anemia after 11 weeks. Four cats were lost to follow\u2010up. The remaining 9 cats underwent follow\u2010up for a period of 11\u2010199 weeks (median 24). Hemoplasma PCR analysis was conducted 2\u20107 times on blood samples at variable time points from 6 of the 9 follow\u2010up cats. The first negative PCR in 4 cases occurred after 3 (CMhm, during antibiotic treatment), 7 (CMhm, during antibiotic treatment), 10 (CMhm, during antibiotic treatment) and 23 (Mhf, after completion of antibiotics) weeks. One cat remained PCR positive (CMhm) at 4, 13, and 18 (all during antibiotic treatment) weeks, and another cat (CMhm) was PCR positive at 199 weeks. Reactivation of the hemoplasma species (documented by hemolysis and positive PCR) occurred in 2 cats (both CMhm) 1 and 3 times, respectively, up to 177 weeks after initial presentation. Reactivation was suspected (no PCR testing available) in 2 additional cases (CMhm [1], Mhf [1]). Four of the 9 follow\u2010up cats were euthanatized after 14\u2010180 weeks (median 24) due to concurrent disease (cardiomyopathy, immune\u2010mediated thrombocytopenia, postoperative complications, diabetes mellitus). Infection with hemoplasmas is often chronic, can reactivate months later and is rarely the reason for euthanasia.",

            "text": "Canine distemper (CD) is a worldwide occurring infectious disease caused by a morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. CDV infection can result in a systemic infection. Dogs presented with neurologic signs revealed the terminal stage of the disease and usually failed to therapy. Additional passive immunotherapy is hypothesized to be beneficial in the early stage of CDV infection. Porcine anti\u2010CDV antibody subunit F(ab')2 [F(ab')2] was produced by Animal Technology Laboratories, Agriculture Technology Research Institute. Eighteen CDV\u2010naturally infected dogs showing respiratory signs but no neurological signs were treated with the combination of F(ab')2 and supportive therapy (group 1). Group 2 included 33 dogs in a similar clinical signs (without neurological signs) that received only supportive therapy. The survival rate was 72.2% (13/18) in group 1 and 33.3% (11/33) in group 2, respectively, with a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). The progressive rates of developing neurological signs during therapy of group1 and group2 were 44.4 and 63.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. The survival rates of dogs developing neurological signs during therapy were 50% (4/8) in group 1 and 4.8% (1/22) in group 2, respectively, with a significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, additional administration of porcine anti\u2010CDV antibody subunit F(ab')2 before developing of neurological signs could decrease the mortality and furthermore reduce the rate of developing neurological signs.",
