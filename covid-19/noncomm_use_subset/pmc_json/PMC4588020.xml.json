ME can be classified as granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, or necrotizing leukoencephalitis based on histopathologic features [28]. However, in veterinary practice, this classification is challenging because it requires biopsy and histopathologic examination. Thus, a simple and rapid strategy for identifying the causative agent of ME would be useful for selecting an appropriate therapeutic regimen.",

Routine techniques in veterinary diagnostic laboratories include bacterial and fungal cultures, immunohistochemistry, antigen-capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [4151719232531]. These methods are laborious, expensive, and time-consuming, and their sensitivity depends on specimen quality, timing of sampling, and prior antimicrobial therapy [7]. Furthermore, different assays for detecting the various pathogens have variable sensitivities and specificities, leading to biased outcomes [3]. Recent studies have used multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (mqPCR) as a diagnostic tool for multifactorial diseases because this approach can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens with good diagnostic performance and is faster than conventional methods [829].",

Recombinant plasmid vectors for B. dermatitidis, C. neoformans, N. caninum, B. burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., T. gondii, E. canis, and CDV were used to assess the analytical specificity and as positive controls. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) extracted from whole blood in two dogs were used as negative controls. All field isolates were identified by culture, conventional PCR, or antigen-capturing ELISA and verified by DNA sequencing. The vectors were constructed by amplifying synthetic oligonucleotides based on sequences obtained from the GenBank database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) using the primers listed in Table 1 and cloned into a T-Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (SolGent, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Correct insertion into the vector was verified by sequencing.

The plate was shaken for 1 min on an orbital multi-well-plate shaker at maximum speed without spilling the sample, after which it was placed on a magnetic stand for 5 min and the supernatant was carefully discarded. The bead pellet was then washed twice each with Wash solution I and II (150 \u00b5L). Next, the plate was vigorously shaken for 2 min, after which the resultant pellet was resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of elution buffer.

However, histopathological diagnosis has little relevance for clinical outcome because treatments are not specific for the ME subtype. A previous study employed PCR to examine the presence of viral agents that cause human ME in a small number of canine ME cases and found that none were positive for human ME viruses [26]. In contrast, the present study focused on eight known neurologic pathogens that have caused outbreaks in Korea and confirmed their relatively high prevalence among dogs with ME (7/47). Therefore, it is possible that the prevalence of neurologic infections causing ME in dogs has been underestimated. Although the cases of ME that tested positive for pathogens were not confirmed by histopathology, one case of infection with Cryptococcus spp. exhibited dramatic clinical improvement after a two-month treatment with oral fluconazole. Moreover, after observation for one year, there was no relapse of neurological signs, suggesting the importance of early pathogen detection for the selection of an effective treatment strategy. In the present study, five of the seven cases of infection were with a fungal agent that could not be eradicated by conventional antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents, demonstrating the importance of proper diagnosis.",

B. dermatitidis, which is endemic to North America, is seldom associated with CNS infection [1] and usually presents with lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltration [17]. B. dermatitidis infection is rare among humans in Korea [24]; however, it was found to be the second most common pathogen in the present study.
