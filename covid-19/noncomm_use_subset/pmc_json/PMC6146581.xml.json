            "text": "In 1884, Waldeyer first described an annular arrangement of lymphatic tissue at the entrance of the aerodigestive tract, which he suggested plays an important part in the host immune system, including the palatine tonsils, pharyngeal tonsil, lingual tonsils and tubal tonsils 1. Especially the palatine as well as pharyngeal tonsils are known to play a key role in the development of the human host defense due to their location, histologic anatomy and functional capacities 2. These structures harbour numerous different types of tissues, including epithelium, lymphoid follicles, blood vessels and connective tissues 34. The combination of these different tissues as well as their anatomic arrangement in crypts facilitates optimised exposure and processing of antigens, which aid in evoking effective immune responses 56. The palatine as well as the pharyngeal tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs and an integral part of the mucosa associated lymphatic tissue complex 7. Multiplication, differentiation and stimulation of B-lymphocytes represent one of their major functions and are essential in processing the specific immune response 8. B-lymphocytes constitute more than 50% of the tonsillar lymphocyte population, in contrast to the blood and other lymphoid organs 910. The induction of the tonsillar-specific immune responses involves several distinct processes where chemokines play an integral role 11-14. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines, which can be classified into four subgroups depending on their arrangement of amino acids, namely CXC-, CC-, C- and CX3C-chemokines 1516. CXC-chemokines, like interleukin (IL)-8 and growth-regulated peptide \u2013 alpha (GRO-alpha), are responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophils, whereas CC-chemokines, like eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), promote the attraction of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils 17.",

Samples were retrieved during surgery after written patient consent was obtained, in accordance with the ethical commission of the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, subjected to the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Tissue samples were divided into four subgroups, based on origin, patient past medical history, clinical presentation and histologic diagnosis established by certified pathologists of the University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel. The subgroups included 21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histologic signs of acute inflammation as per presence of cryptal ulcerations and leukocyte infiltration. At the time of procedure, the median of age for each subgroup was 6, 5, 26, and 7, respectively.

Previously, tonsil size has been shown to be directly proportional to the mean bacterial load 30. The kind of bacteria found in hyperplastic tonsils does not seem to greatly differ from those in recurrently active infected tonsils. However, Haemophilus infection, besides Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes appears to be more common in tonsillar hyperplasia 30. Our investigations demonstrate that hyperplastic tonsillitis is characterised by an acute inflammatory chemokine pattern as IL-8 expression on mRNA levels correlates with the presence of actively infected tissue. IL-8 expression was significantly elevated in acutely infected tissue compared to hyperplastic tonsils (p < 0.01), and in adenoids and chronic tonsillitis compared to hyperplastic tonsils (p < 0.05). Therefore, as IL-8 is an acute phase chemokine expressed in chronic tonsillitis, this suggests an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of chronic tonsillitis. An elevation of IL-8 in acute infections has been described previously 3132, and therefore anticipated for tonsillar disease. However there have been studies showing an equal expression of IL-8 in hyperplastic tonsils and chronic tonsillitis 33. Another reason for a high expression of this chemokine in chronic and hyperplastic disease could be its additional extensive effect on cell proliferation 34.",
