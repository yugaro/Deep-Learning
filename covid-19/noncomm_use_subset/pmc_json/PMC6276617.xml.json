            "text": "Pharyngitis is a common condition. It can last several days and is usually the result of self-limiting viral infections, such as the common cold, although occasionally, pharyngitis can be caused by a bacterial infection. The most commonly reported symptom is sore throat. Antibiotics do not work against the viruses that in most cases cause pharyngitis but are often prescribed anyway. This contributes to antimicrobial resistance, where bacteria become immune to antibiotics and treatment for infections becomes difficult. Alternative treatments could help reduce inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics for pharyngitis, and previous studies have demonstrated the antiviral and pain-relieving qualities of some antiseptic lozenges. The authors conducted a laboratory- based study to assess the ability of antiseptic lozenges to kill a broad range of bacteria known to cause pharyngitis. They found that, when lozenges containing two antiseptic ingredients were dissolved in a solution similar to human saliva, the mixture killed 99.9% of all pharyngitis-associated bacteria that were tested within 10 minutes. These results suggest that patients with uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis may benefit from the antibacterial and pain-relieving action of antiseptic lozenges, including those taking antibiotics. Additionally, antiseptic lozenges may be more relevant and appropriate than antibiotics for pharyngitis of a viral origin.",

These data likewise complement recent studies showing the in vitro viricidal effects of lozenges containing AMC/DCBA (and the active ingredients as free substances) against parainfluenza virus type 3, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.12,13 In addition to antimicrobial activity, AMC and DCBA are proven to provide relief from the symptoms of pharyngitis, particularly sore throat, likely through their demonstrated local anesthetic-like action against voltage-gated neuronal sodium channels,14,34 and therefore may benefit patients presenting with either bacterial or viral pharyngitis. Furthermore, by relieving symptoms and managing patient expectations, the number of instances of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis may be reduced.",
