For CaHV-1, nucleic acid extracted from the liver of a puppy naturally infected with CaHV-1 was used as a control.17 Ultrapure water was used as a negative control in all reactions. The primers used in all reactions are described in Table 1. All reactions were performed using a total volume of 25 \u03bcL with 2 \u03bcL of total DNA (100\u2013200 ng) according to the PCR conditions described for each virus. Primers to CPIV were obtained using the Clone Manager 7 program (http://www.scied.com), and the sequences are shown in Table 1. PCR reaction to CPIV was performed in a 25 \u03bcL volume using 100\u2013200 ng of template DNA, 12.5 \u03bcM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM of dNTPs, 1\u00d7 reaction buffer and 0.75 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR condition was one step at 95 \u00b0C for 7 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C, 45 s), primer annealing (50 \u00b0C, 1 min), extension (72 \u00b0C, 45 s), and a final extension of 7 min at 72 \u00b0C. The PCR products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gel stained with Gel Red\u00ae (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) and visualized under UV light after electrophoresis (60 V, 40 min).",

CaHV-1 was detected in samples collected only from the dogs of shelter #2, corresponding to 6% of the collected samples. Although CaHV-1 may cause respiratory disease, the infection has also been associated with other clinical outcomes, including reproductive disease.35, 36 Due to the ability of CaHV-1 to remain latent in the host, its diagnosis in dog populations should preferentially be performed via serological testing.37, 38, 39, 40 In this sense, we detected positive serology for CaHV-1 in 7 out of 8 dogs in shelter #1 (not shown). A two-year longitudinal investigation in a shelter in the United States involving 211 necropsied dogs showed CaHV-1 involvement in 12.8% and 9.6% of trachea and lung samples, respectively, reinforcing the involvement of CaHV-1 in respiratory disease in dogs.2",

The frequency and dissemination of these viral infections appear to be related to a high population density and poor sanitary and nutritional conditions. These results also indicate the need for control/prevention measures, such as vaccination and good environmental conditions, to minimize these infections in shelter dogs. CPIV infection appears to play an especially predominant role in winter respiratory infections in dog shelters and warrants further preventive measures.",
