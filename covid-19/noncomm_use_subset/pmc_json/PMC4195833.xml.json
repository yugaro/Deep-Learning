            "text": "Developmental differentiation results in changes to intracellular organization and organelle structure as cells adapt to fulfill more specialized roles. The transition from oocyte to embryo requires several coordinated cellular events, including release from meiotic arrest, exocytosis of cortical granules, fusion of male and female pronuclei, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and changes in protein expression (for review see Vacquier, 1981; Whitaker, 2006a; Horner and Wolfner, 2008; Perry and Verlhac, 2008). The developmental program and signaling cascade is initiated by a transient intracellular calcium wave released through IP3 receptors that reside on the surface of the ER, in addition to an influx of extracellular calcium (Ridgway et al., 1977; Steinhardt et al., 1977; Gilkey et al., 1978; Busa and Nuccitelli, 1985; Miyazaki et al., 1992). Work in many other cell types has shown that calcium is one of the most widely used signaling molecules regulating such diverse processes as neuronal signaling (Berridge, 1998), transcription (Ikura et al., 2002), mitochondrial function (Brookes et al., 2004), and apoptosis (Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998). Although it is known that calcium plays a role in numerous cellular events, it is unknown if there are additional roles for calcium during fertilization and early development.",

            "text": "One of the major internal stores for calcium within a cell is the ER (Jaffe, 1983; Eisen and Reynolds, 1985). The ER itself is a complex, continuous membrane structure with a common lumen and includes the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER, which is comprised of sheets (rough ER) and tubules (smooth ER; Baumann and Walz, 2001; Shibata et al., 2006). ER tubules are connected by three-way junctions and include regions of high membrane curvature (Voeltz et al., 2006). In contrast, ER sheets are flat membrane structures with very little curvature except at the edges (Shibata et al., 2010). During interphase, the ER maintains its basic structure, though changes in interactions with the microtubule cytoskeleton (Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1998; Grigoriev et al., 2008; Friedman et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013) and membrane-bound organelles (English and Voeltz, 2013a), as well as continual structural rearrangements (Du et al., 2004), render this organelle quite dynamic. During mitosis, the ER changes morphology and the nuclear envelope fragments and becomes part of the ER (Poteryaev et al., 2005; Puhka et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2009, 2011; Wang et al., 2013). ER tubules and sheets are present in all eukaryotic cells, though the organization and ratios of sheets to tubules vary by cell type (Shibata et al., 2006). In general, cells with a higher ratio of sheets, which usually contain more ribosomes, are specialized for synthesizing secretory and membrane proteins (Hu et al., 2011). In turn, tubules contain very few ribosomes and usually serve as sites of lipid synthesis, vesicle budding, and points of contact with other organelles and the cytoskeleton (Hu et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Recent advances have provided insight into how these different structures are formed and maintained. The reticulons, and related DP1/Yop1 family, localize to the tubular ER (Voeltz et al., 2006) and to the highly curved edges of sheets (Shibata et al., 2010). These proteins form a unique hairpin configuration within the outer membrane leaflet, leading to the highly curved nature of tubules. Depletion of DP1 and reticulons in yeast cells leads to an overabundance of sheets and loss of tubules (Voeltz et al., 2006). In addition, purified reticulon and DP1/Yop1 family members were sufficient to induce tubule formation from vesicles (Hu et al., 2008), which indicates that these proteins play a role in promoting tubule formation. Homotypic fusion of ER tubules leads to network formation and is mediated by members of the Atlastin family (Hu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013), a class of dynamin-like GTPases, and the Rab10 GTPase (English and Voeltz, 2013b). When Atlastins are depleted in cells, long unbranched tubules are observed, which results from the lack of fusion events (Hu et al., 2009). Alternatively, the maintenance and stabilization of ER sheets is mediated by the sheet-promoting factors Climp-63, kinectin, and p180 (Shibata et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In addition to proteins, a large fraction of the transcriptome localizes to the surface of the ER where these mRNAs are translated on membrane-bound ribosomes (Reid and Nicchitta, 2012). Several proteins that promote ER sheet formation have been shown to interact with mRNAs and ribosomes (Shibata et al., 2010), and changes in the translational status of the cell can alter ER morphology and protein distribution (Puhka et al., 2007; Shibata et al., 2010). However, it is not clear how the regulation of stability and localization of mRNAs and ribosomes to the ER affects ER structure. RNA degradation may significantly influence the localization and function of an mRNA. Cellular nucleases are the key enzymes mediating RNA turnover, and their enzymatic activity is generally dependent on divalent cations. Here we used Xenopus laevis egg extracts to explore the hypothesis that an increase in intracellular calcium could regulate the RNA content and morphology of the ER. We show that the calcium-activated ribonuclease XendoU (Caffarelli et al., 1994; Laneve et al., 2003) localizes to the surface of the ER, where it functions in local RNA degradation and eviction of ribosomes, RNPs, and RNA from the membrane surface to ensure proper ER morphology. Additionally, we show that the localization and function of XendoU are maintained in human cells, demonstrating a conserved role for calcium-regulated RNA degradation in control of ER morphology. Thus, we propose that the EndoU family of proteins regulate ER structure and function by mediating local RNA degradation in response to changes in intracellular calcium levels, thereby contributing to the spatial reorganization of the ER network throughout the cell cycle.",

The addition of \u223c0.6 mM calcium chloride to CSF extracts leads to an increase in the free calcium concentration to \u223c1.5 \u00b5M, which mimics the calcium release from intra- and extracellular stores that occurs at fertilization (Busa and Nuccitelli, 1985; Lorca et al., 1991), leading to activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) and exit from CSF-mediated meiotic arrest. X. laevis egg extracts have previously been used to identify several important calcium-regulated factors that play important roles during fertilization, demonstrating the fidelity of this cell-free system (Lorca et al., 1993; Mochida and Hunt, 2007). To determine if calcium regulated RNA metabolism, increasing concentrations of calcium chloride were added to egg extract and total RNA was isolated to determine if there was a change in RNA stability. Surprisingly, specific RNA cleavage products were identified at physiologically relevant calcium concentrations (Fig. 1 A). Addition of magnesium chloride or manganese chloride, common metal cofactors for nucleases, at the same concentrations did not lead to RNA cleavage, which indicates that the nuclease activity in egg extract was dependent on calcium. Treating the extract with EGTA, a known calcium chelator, prevented RNA degradation when added before, and in excess over calcium (Fig. 1 B). When calcium was added before EGTA, cleavage still occurred, indicating that the nuclease acts rapidly and efficiently.",

Examination of Coomassie blue\u2013stained fractions revealed a protein at the expected size of the nuclease activity that also corresponded to the size of the protein isolated in oocytes (Fig. 1 C, black arrow). Mass spectrometry of this band resulted in the identification of XendoU, a nuclease previously studied in the maturation of specific small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs; Laneve et al., 2003).

Depletion of XendoU from the cytosol resulted in a near-complete loss of cleavage activity in the presence of calcium (Fig. 2 C). Cleavage activity was restored after the addition of recombinant wild-type XendoU to the previously depleted extract. RNA cleavage products of the same size and pattern as seen in the IgG control were detected after addition of the recombinant protein, demonstrating that XendoU is the protein responsible for the calcium-dependent RNA catalysis. Interestingly, activity in membrane-free cytosolic extract was more robust than in total egg extract at the same concentration of exogenously added calcium. When comparing cytosolic extract alone and cytosolic extract with the ER and membrane fraction added back, we found that more calcium was required for nuclease activity when membranes were present. This indicates that although the ER is a main source of calcium in the extract, it can also reabsorb cellular calcium (Fig. 2 E) and reduce global RNase activity.",

To determine if specific transcripts were degraded in a XendoU-dependent manner after CaCl2 addition to egg extracts, we prepared mRNA-seq libraries from control and XendoU-depleted extracts arrested in meiosis and after calcium treatment. Because the poly-A tails of many mRNAs change at fertilization (Horner and Wolfner, 2008), we isolated mRNAs using CAP-capture (Blower et al., 2013). We found that there were several mRNAs that appeared to be reduced in control-depleted extracts upon calcium addition but were stable in XendoU-depleted extracts (Fig. S2 A). We hypothesized that mRNAs that are completely degraded after calcium addition would be absent from both CAP-capture and oligo-dT selected mRNA libraries. However, when we prepared mRNA-seq libraries from an additional extract using oligo-dT selection, we did not find any mRNAs that appeared to be degraded upon CaCl2 addition using both mRNA purification methods (Fig. S2 B), which suggests that mRNAs that change in dT or CAP-capture libraries are likely to be the result of deadenylation or decapping, but not RNA degradation. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis failed to confirm consistent degradation of any mRNAs upon addition of CaCl2 (unpublished data). We conclude that XendoU does not function to completely degrade a specific subset of mRNAs upon fertilization (Fig. S2 C), but may function in a local RNA degradation pathway.",

To determine if XendoU regulated the cell cycle after meiotic exit, we incubated sperm nuclei, CaCl2, GFP-Histone H1 (to identify chromatin in live images), and Vybrant DiI (to image the nuclear envelope/membranes) in control and XendoU-depleted extracts. We found that XendoU depletion resulted in a significant delay in nuclear envelope formation (Fig. 3 A) and onset of DNA replication (Fig. S3, A and B), common hallmarks of interphase. Importantly, the timing of cyclin B degradation was not affected (Fig. S3 C) after XendoU depletion (Fig. S3 D), which suggests that the observed effects were not the result of changes in cell cycle timing. Taking into consideration the defect seen in nuclear envelope closure, we investigated general membrane dynamics in the extract, as the nuclear envelope and ER comprise a continuous membranous structure sharing a common lumen. Examination of bulk membranes in the XendoU-depleted extract using octadecyl rhodamine revealed a lack of network formation and characteristic three-way junctions between tubules (Fig. 3 B). Instead, only a few long tubules were observed compared with IgG control-depleted extracts, where a complete network of ER tubules joined by three-way junctions was detected. Previous studies have found that antibody-mediated protein depletion can cause physical damage to extracts, resulting in suboptimal assembly of cellular structures in depleted extracts (Desai et al., 1999). We found this to be especially true for the formation of the ER network, as treatment of extracts with IgG or XendoU antibody beads resulted in a reduction in ER network formation (Fig. 3 B) compared with network formation assays performed in extract that was never incubated with beads (Fig. S4 A). However, XendoU-depleted extracts consistently exhibited ER network assembly defects that far exceeded those caused by control antibody depletion alone (Fig. 3, C and D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that XendoU plays an important role in regulating membrane dynamics during meiotic exit.",

To determine if XendoU associated with the ER, we fractionated egg extract into cytosol and light membrane fractions, which are enriched in ER membranes (Powers et al., 2001). Membrane proteins such as TRAP\u03b1 were only found in the light membrane fractions, whereas highly abundant proteins, such as \u03b1-tubulin, were only found in the cytosol (Fig. 4 A). XendoU was present in both fractions. We found that endogenous XendoU consistently colocalized with ER networks and exhibited a punctate localization to the ER (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, both XendoU and RNA were present on membranes, and subpopulations of both remained stably bound to membranes washed in moderate (200 mM KCl, washed light membrane [wlm] 200) or high salt (500 mM KCl, wlm 500; Fig. 4, C and D). Conversely, dynein and ribosomal proteins S6 and L7a were largely dissociated from light membranes at 500 mM KCl, whereas the association of TRAP\u03b1 with light membranes and salt-washed membranes remained unchanged. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a subpopulation of XendoU is tightly bound to membranes, where it may directly regulate ER dynamics.",

These vesicle fusion reactions have been used to demonstrate a direct role for the reticulons (Voeltz et al., 2006), Atlastin (Hu et al., 2009), and Rab10 (English and Voeltz, 2013b) in mediating homotypic ER fusion events. Salt-washed vesicles (200 mM KCl) devoid of cytosolic and peripheral membrane proteins were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the presence of ATP and GTP, resulting in the formation of a network (Fig. 5 A). No networks formed in the absence of ATP and GTP (Fig. 5 A). Networks formed in the presence of IgG (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, when XendoU antibody was included in the reaction, networks failed to form and only small vesicles were detected (Fig. 5 A). It is important to note that vesicle fusion in this system does not rely on the addition of exogenous calcium, but the vesicle fusion reaction itself releases calcium from the lumen of the ER (Voeltz et al., 2006). Consistent with our results, addition of 5\u20325\u2032-dibromo BAPTA, a calcium chelator, blocks vesicle fusion in this system (Dreier and Rapoport, 2000), and BAPTA blocks nuclear envelope formation in X. laevis egg extracts (Sullivan et al., 1993).

Using a very conservative RNase treatment at 0.01 ng/\u00b5l, we observed that only a small fraction of the RNA present on membranes was degraded (as compared with 0.1 and 1 ng/\u00b5l), as seen by comparing the accumulation of specific RNA fragments over increasing concentrations to untreated wlms (Fig. 5 E). When these treated membranes were used in the vesicle fusion reaction in the presence of ATP and GTP, a dense ER network formed more rapidly, with a far greater number of tubules as compared with standard wlms (Fig. 5 F). In the absence of ATP and GTP, neither membrane preparation formed a network (Fig. S4, B and C). Additionally, in the presence of high RNase concentrations (0.1\u20131 ng/\u00b5l), extremely dense, aberrant networks formed, exhibiting large round vesicles and an absence of tubular ER network (Fig. 5 F). These results indicate that low-level nonspecific RNA cleavage on ER membranes promotes network formation, but that excess RNA removal results in aberrant ER morphology, indicating that controlled RNA removal from the ER is important for normal ER morphology.",

To determine the localization of the two human EndoU isoforms, we created GFP fusion constructs and cotransfected these into HeLa cells with an mCherry-Sec61\u03b2 plasmid to identify ER (Fig. 6, C and D).

Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrates knockdown of EndoU (Fig. 6 B). Knockdown of EndoU, either by esiRNAs directed against the coding region or 3\u2032 UTR, resulted in loss of the tubular ER and expansion ER sheets (Fig. 6, E and F), similar to the phenotype observed upon loss of Rab10 function (English and Voeltz, 2013b).

Catalytically active, but not catalytically inactive, EndoU2 and EndoU-short are able to partially rescue the ER defect phenotype (Fig. 6 G and Fig. S5 A), similar to the rescue observed using the recombinant XendoU protein in X. laevis extract (Fig. 3, C and D). Partial rescue of the ER morphology phenotype by both ER-localized EndoU2 and largely cytoplasmic EndoU-short demonstrates that EndoU can regulate ER morphology whether it is statically localized to the ER (EndoU2) or recruited to the ER from the cytoplasm (EndoU-short), similar to the situation observed with XendoU.

We purified the protein responsible for calcium-dependent catalysis and found that it was XendoU, a protein previously described to play a role in snoRNA processing in X. laevis oocyte nuclear extract (Caffarelli et al., 1994, 1997). Although it has been shown that XendoU activity on a snoRNA target in nuclear extract and with recombinant protein relies on manganese, we also note that the previously described XendoU was dramatically more active in calcium (Caffarelli et al., 1994, 1997), which is consistent with our results. The XendoU crystal structure does not contain Mn2+ ions even when the crystals are soaked in MnCl2 (Renzi et al., 2006), which suggests that XendoU likely has a higher affinity for calcium than for manganese. Activity of XendoU in the presence of manganese occurs at 5\u20137 mM (Caffarelli et al., 1994), which is significantly higher than what occurs in the cell (Tholey et al., 1988; Zhang and Ellis, 1989), whereas XendoU activation by calcium in extracts occurs at the same concentration that mimics fertilization (Busa and Nuccitelli, 1985; Lorca et al., 1991). Collectively, these data suggest that calcium is likely the relevant cofactor for the majority of XendoU functions, whereas manganese may play a more limited role in activating XendoU for snoRNA processing.",

RNase A, which also produces cleavage products with ends identical to those produced by XendoU, does not require a divalent cation for catalysis. In turn, XendoU lacks an obvious metal binding site (Renzi et al., 2006), yet requires a metal cofactor for catalysis. These observations are consistent with XendoU belonging to a novel class of ribonucleases.",

            "text": "In this study, we used X. laevis egg extracts to mimic elevation of cytosolic calcium levels that occur upon calcium release from the ER at fertilization. It is known that many changes in organelle structure and distribution take place at fertilization, including the mitochondria and ER (Terasaki et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2011). In addition to fertilization, there is evidence from many different systems that calcium transients occur during mitosis (for review see Whitaker, 2006b) and may play a role in various aspects of cell cycle control. A recent study has demonstrated that X. laevis egg extracts faithfully recapitulate changes in ER morphology that occur during the cell cycle (Wang et al., 2013). Previous work has demonstrated that the mitotic ER is composed almost entirely of sheets, which reorganize to form the nuclear envelope, and an ER composed of a mixture of sheets and tubules at mitotic exit (Lu et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013). The dramatic morphological changes of the ER during mitosis highlight the dynamic nature of this organelle (Voeltz et al., 2002) and demonstrate that large changes in ER structure are well correlated with calcium transients. Interestingly, we found that immunodepletion of XendoU in interphase extracts blocked formation of the nuclear envelope and ER network assembly. The requirement for XendoU in ER network assembly was strictly dependent on the catalytic activity of XendoU, which is identical to what we observed for human EndoU in cultured cells. These results are consistent with XendoU playing a role in ER remodeling at fertilization, although further studies will be required to directly test this hypothesis.",

In an attempt to determine if specific mRNAs were degraded in a XendoU-dependent manner, we sequenced mRNAs before and after calcium addition to egg extracts. We found that there were no mRNAs that were dramatically degraded upon calcium addition, demonstrating that XendoU does not function to completely degrade any specific set of mRNAs. Because we have observed that XendoU is active on the surface of ER membranes, and is likely to have very little sequence specificity, we speculate that the RNAs targeted by XendoU will likely be determined by proximity to the nuclease upon activation by calcium release from the ER. We hypothesize that these target RNAs will include both ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and mRNAs localized to the surface of the ER that are in the process of being translated into secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Rapid uptake of free calcium by the ER will likely limit the RNase activity of XendoU, which is consistent with our observation that the addition of purified membranes to clarified cytosol dampens XendoU activity as compared with the same concentration of calcium added to cytosol alone. This mechanism would limit RNase activity on the surface of the ER, which is important for proper ER morphology, as we found that high RNase concentrations result in aberrant ER morphology.",

We speculate that RNA cleavage functions to clear a patch of ER membrane, possibly to remove complexes that could sterically hinder the vesicle fusion machinery, allowing for tubule growth and fine-tuning of network remodeling (Fig. 7 A). In X. laevis egg extracts, the loss of XendoU leads to a failure of vesicle fusion and a lack of tubular ER network. Loss of EndoU in HeLa cells leads to a loss of tubular ER and an expansion of ER sheets. This is consistent with the observation that ER tubules generally contain fewer ribosomes than ER sheets (Puhka et al., 2007; West et al., 2011), though it is unknown how the difference in ribosome occupancy is achieved by the cell. Our results support the model that XendoU is part of the molecular mechanism that regulates ribosome occupancy on the surface of the ER, and therefore affects ER morphology.",

Among the most intriguing is the membrane-bound GTPase Atlastin, which is required for ER formation in several different systems (Hu et al., 2009; Orso et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013) and is sufficient to promote vesicle fusion in a purified system (Orso et al., 2009; Bian et al., 2011). Structural and biochemical studies have demonstrated that Atlastin can form two different types of dimers that are likely to be important intermediates in the vesicle fusion reaction (Bian et al., 2011). Because XendoU is not homologous to other proteins that are important in vesicle fusion, it seems likely that XendoU facilitates vesicle fusion at a step after Atlastin functions (Fig. 7 B). Perhaps Atlastin-mediated vesicle dimerization promotes calcium release from the ER lumen that activates XendoU activity to promote efficient vesicle fusion.",

Calcium plays a well-documented role in the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane during exocytosis (for review see Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012). In addition, several studies have shown that release of calcium from the lumen of fusing vesicles is required for SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion (Peters and Mayer, 1998; Schekman, 1998; Ungermann et al., 1998), although it is unclear how vesicle fusion triggers calcium release or what calcium channel is used. Work using X. laevis extracts has demonstrated a role for both calcium and the IP3 receptor in mediating nuclear envelope formation (Sullivan et al., 1993, 1995), which suggests that the IP3 receptor could be a potential calcium channel activated during vesicle fusion.",

In human cells, all changes in intracellular calcium arise as a consequence of release from intracellular stores, primarily the ER. Recent work has shown that calcium signaling in neuronal cells leads to a dramatic rearrangement of the ER (Cui-Wang et al., 2012). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that down-regulation of mouse EndoU suppressed activation-induced cell death in B cells (Poe et al., 2014). B cell activation is accompanied by increased calcium signaling and an enormous expansion of the ER, which is consistent with the observation that changes in EndoU levels modulate ER structure. Collectively these results suggest that EndoU proteins are likely to function in general ER structure, but that they may play an increased role in response to calcium signaling.",
