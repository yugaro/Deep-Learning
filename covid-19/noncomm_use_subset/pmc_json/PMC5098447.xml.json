For example, close examination of the sequences and physical properties of antibodies that have reached advanced stages of development will likely provide useful guidelines for novel antibody developability. Max Vasquez (Adimab) will kick off the workshop with his analysis of over 140 antibodies providing deep insight into factors to improve successful outcomes. Next, Devin Tesar (Genentech) will describe efforts to engineer molecules with long vitreal half-lives to improve therapy for age-related macular degeneration. A major outcome of this work is the finding that hydrodynamic size is a key contributor to the rate of vitreal clearance. Isolation of stable, highly productive cell lines remains a critical step in development of a large scale manufacturing process. Optimization of pre-clinical Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line development will be covered by Bo Yu (Larix Bioscience). Big Pharma and small biotech are increasingly outsourcing the late stage development and manufacturing of their biologics. Success at this expensive step can be \u2018make-or-break\u2019 for the drug candidate, so selection of the most appropriate contract manufacturing organization (CMO) is critical. Stephen Chamow (Chamow & Associates, Inc.) will discuss the process of successfully identifying and managing a CMO to help ensure a successful Phase 1 clinical study.",

These immune-receptor repertoires are extremely diverse, and comprise multiple cellular subsets. Initially, \u201cna\u00efve\u201d B-cell and T-cell subsets are generated in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, by the recombination of \u201cgermline\u201d V, D and J gene segments, yielding VDJ recombinants that encode the V domain of a complete Ig heavy chain or TcR beta chain. Following a \u201cproductive VDJ rearrangement\u201d, germline V and J gene segments are then recombined to encode the V domain of Ig light chains or TcR alpha chains. Three mechanisms of diversification at the joints between V\u2013D, D\u2013J and V\u2013J gene segments lend further diversity to the antigen-contacting regions of Igs and TcRs: imprecise joining, and the addition of N and P nucleotides. Thus, the diversity of the initial, \u201cna\u00efve\u201d repertoires is produced both by combinatorial diversity at the levels of germline gene recombination and through the combination of heavy and light or alpha and beta chains. After undergoing positive and negative selection, functional na\u00efve B- and T-cell repertoires circulate through the secondary lymphoid tissues, where they encounter antigens. With the proper stimulation, antigen-binding clones are activated to divide and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, \u201cmemory\u201d B cells, and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, often with the help of CD4+ T cells, B cells undergo isotype switching (from IgM and IgD to IgG, IgA and/or IgE), and accumulate somatic hypermutations in their functional IGHV and IGLV gene regions. Thus, through the process of antigen recognition, antigen-activated B and T cells become \u201cclonally expanded\u201d, and from successive rounds of somatic hypermutation, B cells will also form \u201clineages\u201d expressing clonally related Igs.",

            "text": "B and T cells form the heart of adaptive immune responses, and are key to our understanding of health and disease, and to the development of therapeutics and vaccines. As such, there is keen interest in methods that can characterize the repertoires of various na\u00efve, memory and effector B- and T-cell subsets. Over the past 5-6 years, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been adapted to characterize antibody and T-cell receptor repertoires from the blood and other tissues of people and animals. Briefly, mRNA from B or T cells is converted to cDNA, their recombined V(D)J regions are then PCR amplified and sequenced, using either primers specific for the entire set of germline genes or by 5\u2032 RACE to cover the 5\u2032 end of the V region, and constant-region-specific primers to cover the 3\u2032end; this produces tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of sequences. B- and T-cell clonal expansions can be deduced from analysis of these sequences, and B-cell clonal lineages can be deduced from the somatic mutation patterns of closely related clones. Analysis of B- and T-cell repertoires derived from different cellular compartments (e.g., blood vs. solid tissue) can reflect clonal migration, whereas repertoire analysis of different cellular subsets can reflect pathways of clonal differentiation.",

            "text": "Yet, in view of the amazing insights that immune repertoire analyses can now provide, there are significant bioinformatics challenges in taking such analyses to the next level of biological integration. This session is focused on the challenges posed in integrating immune repertoire data with other, large-scale and complex biological data. Session co-chair, George Georgiou, will describe his approach to quantifying individual antibodies comprising the serum antibody response through a combination of HTS of the recombined Ig genes from antigen-specific B cells and mass-spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments generated from antigen-specific Igs from the blood. Examples of deep analyses of serum antibodies elicited by vaccination and against pathogenic cells will be described. Brandon DeKosky (Vaccine Research Center, NIH) will follow with the use of paired VH-VL read technology in developing sequential vaccines that reiterate the ontogeny of neutralizing antibody development for a class of HIV-specific antibodies. Daniel Emerling (Atreca, Inc.) will report on clinical-level studies of immune repertoires based on sequence analysis of the two chains of antibodies. One example involves patients during a vaccine trial, with Ig-repertoire analyses of B-cells and plasmablasts informing vaccine strategies. Ludvig Sollid (University of Oslo) has been working on the role of B- and T-cells and antigens in celiac disease; he will describe the interaction of antibody and TcR repertoires, along with the role of proteolytic products of the autoantigen, gluten, in driving this disease. Jake Glanville (Stanford University) has developed methods for deducing antigen specific B and T-cell receptors out of high-throughput sequencing data. This would provide a computational approach to identifying both B- and T-cell clones involved in immunological processes, including in the absences of knowledge of the etiological agent. Johanna Olweus (Oslo University Hospital) will describe her approach of using the TcR-repertoire data derived from healthy individuals to discover TcRs that can recognize cancer neoantigens. This provides a way of discovering cancer-specific TcRs that can be \u201cimplanted\u201d into autologous T cells, then expanded and activated to specifically attack a patient's tumor cells. These presentations will provide excellent examples of the burgeoning systems-biology approaches currently under development, in which \u201cbig data\u201d characterizing different, complex biological processes are integrated to reveal important new insights and discoveries.",

            "text": "Antibodies have naturally evolved to work together. Protective polyclonal antibody responses against pathogens typically consist of complex mixtures of antibodies directed against distinct disease-related targets and epitopes. Antibody mixtures thereby provide an ability to target disease heterogeneity and plasticity and to prevent escape. Strikingly, most approved passive immunotherapy approaches (i.e., based on administering purified, recombinant antibodies with defined specificity) are still being developed as monotherapies. In the search for more potent and effective treatments, it therefore makes a lot of sense to investigate the educated assembly of antibody combinations in bispecific and designer polyclonal preparations. In addition to widening target binding, antibody-mediated effector functions are more effective when antibodies work in close concert with each other. This session will report new insights into the selection and design of bi- and multi-specific antibody therapeutics and investigate the implications for the mechanisms of action of such products.",

Theoretical and practical considerations would suggest that functional libraries should provide specific binders at the rate of approximately one binder per ten million clones. However, as libraries have grown exponentially larger, the number of isolated/identified binders has not increased correspondingly. By comparing the diversity of binders obtained from the same original na\u00efve antibody genetic material screened by: 1) phage display; 2) phage combined with yeast display; and 3) phage/yeast display with next-generation sequencing, this talk will illustrate how the diversity of isolated binders depends upon the screening/selection methods used. An alternative approach to traditional display technologies is the use of two hybrid methods, such as yeast two hybrid. Antonino Cattaneo (Scuola Normale Superiore) will describe the further development of this technology to select antibodies recognizing specific targets, particularly how it can be applied to the selection of antibodies against specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). This involves the anchored in vivo site-specific modification of a specific target, followed by the in vivo (yeast) selection of antibodies recognizing that modification. The selection of functional antibodies against acetylated and conformational targets will be described. One important advantage of this technique is that selected antibodies are functional within the cytoplasm. As a result, in addition to being able to inhibit PTM activity, selected antibodies tend to be particularly stable.",

These are based on small biologically active cysteine-rich peptides that have been identified in a variety of plants and toxins. By inserting such cysteine-rich peptides into an antibody complementarity-determining region, the function of the peptide can be conferred upon the antibody, while simultaneously improving half-life and manufacturability. X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays confirm that both peptide and antibody are correctly folded and active. This approach has been used to generate antibodies able to block ion channels, targets that are traditionally difficult to inhibit with traditional antibody selection methods.",

He will compare and discuss both therapeutic approaches, focusing on the differences of both approaches with regards to optimization of TCRs and the biological effects. Blinatumomab, a fragment-based bispecific CD19xCD3 antibody, validated the power of CD3 bispecifics: engaging T cells in B cell malignant cell killing. However, a fragment-based approach leads to short half-life and a need for frequent dosing. Recent progress in the field of bispecific technologies enables the development of full-length (i.e., regular antibody architecture) bispecific antibodies for T-cell recruitment approaches. A frontrunner full-length bispecific antibody program is being presented by Eric Smith (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals). He will discuss the advantages of their human full-length CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody. Next, another full length bispecific antibody product will be discussed by Francois Gaudet (Janssen).
