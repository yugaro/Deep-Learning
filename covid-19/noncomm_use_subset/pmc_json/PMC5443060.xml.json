Neutralization titers or index above 0.01, 200mIU/ml and 5 are indicative of protective immunity against tetanus,1 measles2 and yellow fever,3 respectively, in vaccine recipients. However, for protection against numerous disease causing agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Plasmodium parasites, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Lassa virus, Ebolavirus and Marburg virus, induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses are desirable. As a result, considerable efforts are put into developing vectors capable of generating both cellular and antibody (Ab) responses against the target gene (transgene).",

As a result, earlier clinical trials were almost exclusively performed using HAd5 vectors.8 However, although HAd5 vectors were highly efficacious in pre-clinical studies, they did not perform as anticipated in clinical trials due to pre-existing HAd5 immunity in the participants from natural exposure. Adenoviruses are some of the pathogens that can cause the common cold and a significant proportion of the human population have antibodies against these viruses due to past infections naturally acquired in the community, notably during childhood.9,10 These natural exposures can be responsible for long-lasting immunity (pre-existing immunity) that can interfere with HAd-based vaccines. In a phase I trial, individuals with pre-existing HAd5 immunity mounted lower immune responses compared with participants without pre-existing immunity.5 Pre-existing immunity to HAd5 was even associated with undesirable effects beyond neutralization of the benefits intended from vaccination. The negative impact of pre-existing HAd5 immunity was illustrated in the infamous STEP trial during which a lower frequency of individuals with high HAd5 Ab titers developed a cellular response to the transgenes (HIV Gag, Pol and Nef). Furthermore, pre-existing HAd5 immunity was associated with an increase in HIV acquisition in vaccinated participants in comparison to the placebo.7 Pre-existing HAd5 immunity was not taken into account in pre-clinical studies as animals used in these studies, such as mice and NHPs, are not naturally infected by HAd5 or other human Ads. In contrast, the percentage of the African, European and American population with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HAd5 has been documented to be between 65\u2013100, 61 and 37\u201370%, respectively.11-14",

In addition, in order to determine the contribution of Ad specific T cells and Ab in pre-existing immunity, T cells or serum from Ad immune animals can be transferred in na\u00efve ones. This review will first summarize the contributions of the different arms of the immune system toward pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors.

The relative contribution of each subset of nAbs has been teased apart by vaccinating Ad pre-immuned animals with capsid chimeric Ad vectors. From these studies, nAbs targeting the hexon protein appears to play a dominant role in vivo.18-22 Hexon specific nAbs are directed against exposed loops on the surface of the virus particle. These exposed loops are also known as hypervariable regions (HVR). Replacing the entire HAd5 hexon sequence22 or simply the exposed epitopes of HAd5 hexon21 with hexon or HVR from a different serotype, was sufficient to overcome pre-existing HAd5 immunity in rodents. In addition, a three amino acid substitution mutation in one of the HVR was able to greatly reduce in vitro neutralization by a NHP polyclonal serum raised against chimpanzee Ad serotype 68 (ChAd68) derived vector.19 Conversely, addition of the hexon domain of simian Ad serotype 23 (SAd23/Pan6) into a SAd24/Pan7 vector rendered the chimeric vector susceptible to pre-existing SAd23/Pan6 immunity, as illustrated by reduce transgene expression in rodents.18",

NAbs generated after a single HAd7 injection can only weakly neutralize chimeric HAd5 vector expressing HAd7 fiber, indicating that most nAbs were generated against other capsid proteins. Conversely, nAbs generated after a single HAd5 injection can readily neutralize chimeric HAd5 vector expressing HAd7 fiber.23 In vivo, pre-existing ChAd6 immunity inhibited expression of the transgene from chimeric SAd24/Pan7 vectors that possess the ChAd6 hexon protein but not those that possess the ChAd6 fiber protein.18 Passive transfer of mouse serum containing Abs against a chimeric HAd35 expressing HAd5 fiber, did not impact cellular and humoral immune responses against the transgene generated after HAd5 injection.20 One caveat of the above studies is that in vivo, nAbs targeting the fiber are less common after a single injection23 but are more readily detectable after two or more immunizations with the same adenovirus.15,17,20 However, in most animal studies, pre-existing immunity is generated by a single Ad injection. The induced Ab response is probably of limited breath and neutralizing titer compared with humoral responses generated in individuals after repeated natural infections with replication competent Ad. As a result, these studies may underestimate the role played by nAbs targeting Ad fiber; especially as nAbs against Ad fiber and penton can act synergistically.17",

The impact of non-neutralizing Abs was elegantly illustrated by Pichla-Gollon and colleagues who demonstrated that passive transfer of an Ab able to bind, but not neutralize, could reduce transgene expression as well as immunogenicity of a modified Chad68 vector.26 The inhibitory effect of cross-reactive but non neutralizing Ab is of particular concern, as these Abs seem to be readily inducible.25\n\n",

Yang and colleagues demonstrated that cellular responses generated by DNA primes and HAd boost (DNA/HAd5) were not affected by pre-existing HAd5 immunity. In addition, although generated humoral responses were significantly reduced by pre-existing immunity, the antibody titers obtained were similar to those generated in na\u00efve mice immunized with homologous HAd5 prime-boost.97 The ability of a DNA prime to circumvent pre-existing immunity was further suggested in a clinical trial. In tested individuals, pre-existing HAd5 immunity did not affect T cell responses induced by a DNA prime, HAd5 boost regimen, while pre-existing HAd5 immunity decreases cellular responses generated after a single HAd5 injection.98",

Indeed, although compare with na\u00efve animals immune responses generated after ChAd68/ChAd1 prime-boost immunization were decreased in HAd5 pre-immune NHPs, stronger humoral responses were obtained compared with HAd5 homologous prime-boost.99 Finally, it will be a great interest to determine whether prime-boost regimens including Ad vectors in combination with other vaccine platforms such as modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA)are also able to provide protection despite pre-existing immunity. Indeed in pre-clinical studies, regimens involving MVA and Ad encoding plasmodium berghei CS protein or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) S protein were able to induce very robust T cell and Ab responses of higher magnitude than Ad/DNA regimens expressing the same insert.93,100 ChAd63/MVA prime-boost are even being tested in various stages of clinical trials against Malaria, HIV and HCV.101 Results from these trials will be crucial in terms of determining the ability of ChAd/MVA prime-boost regimens to overcome pre-existing HAd immunity.

However, determining which of the numerous vaccine platforms available, including DNA, VSV, AAV, and MVA, are best suited for priming or boosting of Ad vectors will be crucial. In addition, prime-boost regimens are time consuming thus precluding the rapid induction of protective immunity, which can be desirable in emergency vaccination situations, for example against pathogens that emerge or re-emerge sporadically in unpredictable locations.",

            "text": "Tremendous effort has been made in circumventing pre-existing Ad immunity in the human population. An important focus has been on the development of new animal based Ad vectors, especially Ad vectors of simian origin. While most of these vectors are in pre-clinical phases of development, some, including ChAd3 and ChAd63, have reached clinical trials. Selection of alternative Ad serotypes has been mainly driven by the absence of neutralizing Ab against these serotypes in the human population. However, the impact of Ad specific T cells on the efficacy of these vectors has been mainly overlooked. This is in part due to the complex nature of T cell assays that are designed to detect anti-Ad T cell responses. Compared with nAbs assays, T cell assays require complex stimulatory conditions and/or multi-parametric flow cytometry. The study of Ad specific T cell responses are further complicated by the presence of TRM that do not circulate in the blood. Isolation of these T cells usually requires mechanical and/or enzymatic disruption of the tissue of interest. These isolation procedures can affect T cell viability and function, which further complicates analysis of TRM cells. In addition, for obvious ethical reasons, isolation of TRM cells is restricted to animal models for most tissues except the skin and gut. Although harder to obtain, information regarding both Ad specific circulating and tissue resident T cells is necessary for a full understanding of pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors and to select the most appropriate Ad vector for clinical use. Therefore, the ability of Ad specific T cells in the target population to cross-react with the Ad vector being developed (chimpanzee, porcine, bovine, ovine) should be systematically investigated.",

Immunization through the airway holds promise and may turn out to be a delivery method of choice for inducing potent and long lasting protective immune responses from an Ad vector. While the airway may be a viable solution to bypass pre-existing immunity, several remaining questions will need to be addressed. Despite the relatively rapid turnover of resident immune cells and IgA in the lungs, the effect of immune stimulation following natural Ad exposure or vaccination will be critical to determine whether the same or other Ad vectors can be re-administer in the airway, at what frequency, and according to what regimen (single dose vs. prime-boost). This knowledge should ultimately inform on the number of independent vaccines one antigenic Ad backbone could be used for. Ultimately, this will have to be determined in clinical studies.",

The immune response generated by prime-boost regimens may be sufficient to induce full protection despite pre-existing Ad immunity. Developing prime-boost regimens using Ad vectors where limited to no nAbs or cross-reactive T cells in the target population should further increase the chance of success. However, optimization of prime-boost regimens will be labor intensive due to the increasing number of available vaccine platforms. Useful data regarding the ability of prime-boost regimens to overcome pre-existing HAd immunity will certainly be generated by clinical trials involving ChAd/MVA prime-boost. Careful analysis of these trials should provide crucial protection information in the presence or absence of pre-existing Ad immunity. In addition, future clinical trials involving Ad vectors should also determine whether Ad-based vaccine regimens impact HIV acquisition. Although HAd5 immunization increased HIV acquisition in participants with pre-existing HAd5 immunity in the STEP trial, whether this trend holds true for other Ad vectors expressing different inserts needs to be systematically evaluated. Upcoming clinical trials performed in populations at high risk of HIV infection will address this critical issue.",
