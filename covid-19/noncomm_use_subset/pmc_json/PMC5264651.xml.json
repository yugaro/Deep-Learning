            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family that was first identified in Uganda in 1947. The virus has recently attracted global attention due to its rapid spread from Brazil to other countries in the Americas (Dick et al., 1952, Zanluca et al., 2015). The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil has been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly (Zanluca et al., 2015) and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and has been declared a \u201cGlobal Emergency\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en/; WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/1st-emergency-committee-zika/en/; CDC 2016 http://www.cdc.gov/zika/). Concern over the spread of ZIKV to the Northern Hemisphere with its concomitant morbidity is spurring the search for an effective vaccine. ZIKV is related to dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses (WNV), all of which are arthropod-borne flaviviruses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV contains a positive, single-stranded, genomic RNA encoding a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed to yield three structural proteins: the capsid (C), the precursor of membrane (prM), and the envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) (Dick et al., 1952).",

            "text": "The succesful development of flavivirus vaccines began 80 years ago in 1937 with the yellow fever YFV17D live-attenuated vaccine (Monath, 2008). Since then, > 600 million people have been vaccinated, with 98% protection and a > 10 year persistence of vaccine\u2013induced immunity (Barrett and Teuwen, 2009). However, several severe adverse events associated with vaccine administration have been observed over the last 20 years. Thus, a purified, inactivated vaccine has been recently developed and its testing results suggest good immunogenicity and tolerability (Monath et al., 2011). A few weeks ago, two studies showing immunogenicity of a plasmid DNA or adenovirus (serotype 52) expressing virus-like particles in mice and non-human primates were published (Larocca et al., 2016, Abbink et al., 2016). Here, to build on these initial findings to develop an effective ZIKV vaccine, we describe the development of a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing codon-optimized ZIKV E antigen and a subunit recombinant ZIKV E vaccine delivered transcutaneously by carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) microneedle arrays (MNAs) (Bediz et al., 2014, Korkmaz et al., 2015), investigate their ability to induce neutralizing immune responses, and assess their ability to passively protect against ZIKV challenge in a novel neonatal ZIKV infection mouse model.",

Subsequently, replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as Ad5.ZIKV-Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination. Moreover, we also purified recombinant proteins named ZIKV-rEfl from the supernatant using His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) under native conditions to be used as a subunit vaccine. Briefly, the supernatant of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells infected with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl was heat-inactivated at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min and mixed with the same volume of binding buffer (40 mM imidazole, 900 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) previously equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) was added and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rotation. The next day, the settled resin mix was packed into an empty column. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer three times followed by 10 ml of wash buffer (40 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) three times and eluted in 10 ml of elution buffer (500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The eluate was concentrated and desalted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore). This desalting step was repeated three times. The concentrations of the purified recombinant ZIKV-Efl were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a protein standard.",

Building upon the knowledge (Dick et al., 1952) that day 7- (but not day 14-) old suckling mice are susceptible to ZIKV infection via the i.p. route showing neurological signs, pups were obtained by mating immunized female with nonimmunized male mice at week 3 after booster immunization. Pups were challenged i.p. at seven days after birth with 105 pfu of ZIKV DAKAR41542, monitored daily for mortality, and weighed for 15 days. The mean time to disease onset (10% weight loss) was slightly earlier in the pups from PBS-immunized mice than in those from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized mice, although the difference was not significant (7.75 vs. 8.25 days, P = 0.1598) (Table 1). All pups born to PBS-immunized mice showed more than a 20% body weight loss in the 10 days postinfection. However, weight loss in the MNA-ZIKV-rEfl pups was reduced and a significant difference was found from day 12 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001, day 13\u2013day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. No weight loss was observed in the pups born to the dams immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine and no significant difference was measured between the pups of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice and the unchallenged control pups for the entire period. The significant difference started at day 8 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001, day 9\u2013day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. (Fig. 3a). The survival rates of pups from two animals in each group were also monitored after challenge with ZIKV DAKAR41542. Survival rates of 100% (10/10) and 50% (3/6) were observed in the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams, respectively, whereas a 12.5% (1/8) survival rate was seen in pups from PBS-immunized dams (Fig. 3b). The differences between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those from PBS-immunized dams and between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those from MNA-ZIKV-immunized dams were statistically significant (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0136, respectively). When the pups from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl- and PBS-immunized dams were compared, no significant difference in survival rate was observed (P = 0.1493), indicating that the Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine candidates were efficient in passively protecting neonatal mice against lethal ZIKV challenge.",

This is because the prevalence of anti-adenovirus serotype 5-neutralizing antibodies in humans limits its use as suitable clinical vaccine platform. However, the experimental use of serotype 5 adenoviral-based vaccines, as shown in this study, is an invaluable tool for the antigen vaccine selection for any given pathogen. Conversely, the MNA-delivered ZIKV vaccine MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although not optimized for inducing neutralizing immunity in the current format, is a clinically applicable vaccine platform to target infectious diseases such as ZIKV. The geometric design of the MNA-based vaccine platform affords unique advantages for efficient delivery and targeting to the superficial skin microenvironment, which is rich in antigen-presenting cells. While immunogenicity was lower than that observed in a previously reported adjuvented and inactivated whole virus vaccine (Larocca et al., 2016), the MNA-based vaccine offers the safety and clinical advantages of a defined recombinant subunit antigen and the potential for local co-delivery of adjuvants at very low doses. Co-delivery of TLR ligand adjuvants at very low concentrations can substantially increase the immunogenicity of an influenza subunit vaccine (Weldon et al., 2012). Importantly, the fabrication process of MNAs affords unique product advantages in reproducibility, safety, manufacturing, and distribution critical for widespread clinical deployment. Thus, our current and future efforts toward the clinical translation of ZIKV vaccine are directed toward the testing and comparison of different E antigen formats (dimeric vs. trimeric), and clinically relevant antigen-adjuvant formats that can be co-delivered in MNAs.",

            "text": "One thing that we learned in the presented ZIKV vaccine studies is that the yield of production of the ZIKV envelope E subunit protein was very low in the current format. This finding, also confirmed by a recently published ZIKV vaccine study (Larocca et al., 2016), is similar to what was previously observed for other flaviviruses (Taylor et al., 2016). The low yield of E protein is probably due to the absence of preM, which is important for protein stability. For instance, expression of WNV E protein alone showed proteolytic cleavage compared to the E protein produced in the presence of preM (Taylor et al., 2016). Thus, the inclusion of preM sequence seems to be an important prerequisite in ZIKV E-based vaccine development. Importantly, in this study, we used an immunocompetent mouse challenge model of ZIKV infection. This approach was inspired by a 1952 publication (Dick et al., 1952) in which ZIKV was shown to be pathogenic in newborn mice. Although this model does not recapitulate the ZIKV pathogenesis observed in humans, it is an effective model to evaluate the in vivo neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced ZIKV immunity. During the conduct of these experiments, many mouse models of ZIKV infection were established in interferon receptor-deficient mice and SJL mice (Cugola et al., 2016, Shah and Kumar, 2016, Miner et al., 2016, Dowall et al., 2016, Lazear et al., 2016, Rossi et al., 2016). Further investigations in SJL mice, the closest clinical model of fetal microcephaly, will be considered to evaluate the efficiency of vaccine candidates here in the future.",
