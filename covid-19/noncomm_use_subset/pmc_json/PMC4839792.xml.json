Moreover, they have used different eligibility criteria and methods for viral identification. In the current study, we adopted standardized criteria and methods to assess the frequency of infection with RSV and 7 other viruses in children aged less than 2 years old hospitalized due to an LRTI in 4 capitals (Aracaj\u00fa, Salvador, Recife, and Macei\u00f3) from Northeastern Brazil over a period of 1 year. We also seek to evaluate the association between the frequency of LRTI in general, of RSV, and of the other viruses and meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and solar radiation).",

Additional inclusion criteria were the presence of respiratory symptoms that had begun no longer than 7 days prior to the study visit, and the ability of the adult legal representative of the child to understand and comply with procedures as outlined in the protocol, providing written consent for the procedures. The only exclusion criteria were the previous use of passive immunization with palivizumab or other antibodies against RSV. All study procedures were done during a single initial visit for every enrolled patient; such procedures included the collection of demographic, social, and medical data, as well as the collection of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). There was no follow-up data after the 1st visit on patients enrolled. Medical diagnosis (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia) was copied from the assistant physician according to their clinical evaluation or defined per protocol by the presence of symptoms of respiratory disease (for instance, cough, coryza, rhinorrhea, fever, or retractions) associated with at least 1 of the following: visible increased anteroposterior diameter, intercostal retractions, tachypnea, apnea, wheezing, or crackles, with no interference from our personal.

The analysis population comprised all children included in the study in accordance with selection criteria. The frequency of each virus was computed as the number of corresponding positive samples divided by the number of tested samples, with its accompanying 95% CI. Seasonal trends were explored by assessing the frequency (the monthly frequency) of proven viral infections throughout the year. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to explore the association between frequency of viral infections and the meteorological variables of interest. Moreover, generalized linear models were used to explore the association between the number of cases of infections from each virus and meteorological data, assuming Poisson or negative binomial distributions, as appropriate. Stepwise logistic regression models were used to explore risk factors for viral infections among variables with statistically significant results (P < 0.20) in univariate fashion. For the multivariate analysis, 2-tailed P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the analysis was done using SAS Software, version 9.3.",

There was no exclusion due to use of Palivizumab in any participant. Thus, 507 children were analyzed. Overall across centers, the median time since the onset of symptoms and the study visit was 4 days (range, 0\u20137 days), and the median time from admission to inclusion in the study was 1 day (range, 0\u20135 days). Eighty-eight percent of the patients came in through the emergency room and admitted to a general ward (56.6%) or to an emergency department ward (43.2%), with only 1 directly admitted to the ICU. The chief demographic, clinical, and social features of patients are shown by center and overall in Table 1. The frequency of hypoxemia differed markedly across centers, what could reflect the different profile of the centers related to emergency/general wards and ICU hospitalizations. With regard to previous diagnoses of interest, 18.3% of children had been premature, 5.5% had congenital heart disease, and 1.0% had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Overall, the mean duration of nonexclusive breastfeeding was 3.7 months; however, a normalized analysis describing this duration as a percentage of the ideal duration of 6 months (or child age for those aged less than 6 months) showed that the overall average was 98.8%.",

We have to take in consideration the limitation of this study design to infer causality. Although the latter variable has questionable biological role, the others are established risk factors for RSV infection in the literature.27,28 On the other hand, other risk factors previously indentified in the literature, such as exposure to tobacco smoke at home, smoking during pregnancy, family history of atopy, the presence of siblings in school age, the duration of breast-feeding, the presence of pets in the home, and the number of residents and visitors at home, could not be confirmed as independent predictors of RSV infection in this study.

This is likely the cause for the differences observed, such as the marked variation in the frequency of hypoxemia. The higher proportion of children with lower oxygen saturation (Macei\u00f3 25.9% and Aracaju 24.6% <90%) may be due to the service characteristic in the 2 cities, with more children at the emergency ward being enrolled. Actually, oxygen saturation, which was not measured in 2.8% of cases, was assessed upon admission in 34.7% of children, and during the study visit in the remaining 62.8% of cases, this may represent a limitation of our study.",

Moreover, there was a statistically significant correlation between the absolute number of cases of RSV infection and an interaction term for these 2 meteorological variables, thus suggesting that higher temperatures associated with decreased humidity increase the number of cases of RSV infection. In a study in Southern Brazil, viral respiratory infections were found to increase as both temperature and the relative air humidity decreased.32 In that study, 54% of hospitalized children aged less than 6 years had any viral infection by RT-PCR, with 29% of cases overall being due to RSV and 23.1% to rhinovirus. Thus, besides some limitation of the assay used different associations between viral infections and temperature may represent the play of chance or else indicate biological phenomena modulated by different viral prevalence and climate conditions between these 2 regions, being another possible cause. With regard to seasonality, viral infections in our study peaked in June, July 2012, February, and March 2013, mostly as a result of the higher frequency of RSV in those months. In a similar study conducted in Fortaleza, Moura et al14 found a higher frequency of RSV infections during the rainy season, especially during the 8 consecutive months starting in January, in their study of 1950 children seen as outpatients or inpatients. In the study by Bezerra et al,7 conducted in Recife, RSV also peaked in the rainy season, from April to July. Cuevas et al21 assessed a smaller number of outpatient and hospitalized children (N = 111) in Aracaj\u00fa; in this study that lasted only 2 months, seasonal trends could not be assessed, but there was a time relation between number of cases and precipitation. When RSV seasonality was assessed in Southeastern Brazil, 88.5% of cases occurred from late summer to mid-autumn in 1 study,33 and in another the frequency was higher in autumn and near-negligible in winter.25 Recently, data from the Brazilian surveillance system of influenza-like illness in sentinel sites showed that RSV cases peaked from March to June, but there were several regional differences.9 Likewise, results from a study on RSV circulation in 7 countries suggest that RSV prevalence is higher during wet months in climates with high annual precipitation, while cold temperatures may be the main factor in other areas; furthermore, no association with meteorological factors or weather trends was observed in one of the countries.4 Therefore, interventions that target the prevalence of RSV have to take into account regional differences in the seasonality of this infection.",

Moreover, it shows that other viruses are often present, sometimes in coinfection with RSV. The differences found in terms of prevalence rates and associations with climate conditions across the 4 study centers highlight the importance of local policies regarding the medical and public health interventions that may be used to address pediatric LRTI, especially among younger children hospitalized because of these infections.",
