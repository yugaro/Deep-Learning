With more epidemics prevented and controlled, it has gradually become the main cause of infant and child mortality. China is one of the countries with high incidence of BD, with 800,000 to 1.2 million infants born with BD and disabilities annually, accounting for four to six percent of the country\u2019s total newborn. The Chinese government has established a surveillance system for monitoring BD since 1986. Twenty-three types of BDs were included in the system according to the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification Codes, tenth edition (i.e., ICD-10). In this research, we analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of BD in perinatal infants in Hubei province (Central China) during 200l\u20132008, in order to provide a scientific basis for developing control measures over prevention of BD on perinatal infants.",

Fifty-two surveillance hospitals were included in 2001 and the number of infants under surveillance was nearly 40,000 each year, which made the data reliable. During 2001\u20132008, 406,264 infants were covered and the BD prevalence was 12\u2030 (4,874 of 406,264), far exceeding the earlier prevalence (8\u2030) during 1997\u20132002 (1). The prevalence of 2008 was 13.85\u2030, a little higher than the national average prevalence (13.49\u2030). The data indicated an increase of BD prevalence, the same trend as the whole nation (2). To speculate, it may relate to several things. First, surveillance system was improved to make the data more genuine, especially with the advanced prenatal diagnostic techniques and expertise skills. Second, as the forcible premarital health assessment was cancelled, the risks of BD were increased. Furthermore, as modernization of the city, pollution and other modern life-related risks and lifestyle (e.g. delayed childbearing) (3) were responsible too.",

The enhanced maternal and child health care in rural may contribute to the offset. The difference of prevalence between male and female was significant; the former prevalence was much higher, which paralleled with the data previously published (4). Advanced maternal age (over 35 years old) was related to a higher BD prevalence, but with no significance compared to the younger group, different from a majority of the data previously published (4, 5). The recent emphasis on the antenatal care and prenatal screening for pregnant women over 35 years old might be partly related to this difference.",

Genetic factors contributing to CLP have been identified for some syndromic cases and many genes associated with syndromic cases of CLP have also been identified to contribute to the incidence of isolated cases of CLP (6). Besides, CLP and other congenital abnormalities have been linked to maternal hypoxia, as caused by e.g. maternal smoking (7\u20139), maternal alcohol abuse or some forms of maternal hypertension treatment (10). Integration of genetic and environmental risk using different methods may generate a synthesis that will both better characterize etiologies, as well as provide access to better clinical care and prevention (11). A case-control study by JY Luo, et al. (12) on polydactyly showed that heredity was the foremost risk factor. At the same time, CHD was growing year after year, ranking top three in 2008, which was partly due to improved prenatal diagnostic techniques and skills and increased environmental risks. With above three BDs, hydrocephaly, EEM and NTDs were still the main BDs and constituted over 50% of all BDs, while shooting up to 64% in 2003 probably due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which made hospitals screening for BD in a much more cautious way.",

Data published on Annual Report of the National Maternal and Child Health Care Surveillance and Communications in June, 2009 indicated that the prenatal diagnosis rate in Hubei province in 2008 was 14.29%, a bit lower than eastern coastal cities and provinces. All the data showed that there was more the maternal and child health care could do to improve the present situation. As periconceptional folate supplementation has a strong protective effect against NTDs (13), pregnant woman has been encouraged to take folic acid supplements to prevent NTDs by doctors. Actually, the decrease of NTDs did happen which was owe mainly to the folic acid supplements taking measure (14). To reduce the overall prevalence of BD, it is necessary to keep the surveillance system function properly and provide prevention and health care service extensively. To reduce the rate of missing report of surveillance hospitals and make the BD data much more convenient and accessible, it is of help to draw lessons from the European network of registers for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies, the EUROCAT (15). Besides, primitive maternal and child health care service should be easily approachable for women of childbearing age, especially those living in rural areas (16). Furthermore, studies on the integration of genetic and environmental risks, especially the links between environmental geochemistry and prevalence of BD (17), are also important for better characterizing etiologies, as well as providing access to better clinical care and prevention.",
