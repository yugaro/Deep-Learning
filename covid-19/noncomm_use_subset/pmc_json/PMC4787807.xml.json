Their distinctive transcription mechanism involves the synthesis of a variable set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, which are 3\u2032 co-terminal with the viral genome (reviewed in (9, 10)). In most nidoviruses, sg mRNAs and genome also share a common 5\u2032 leader sequence. The synthesis of sg mRNAs (transcription) and genome RNA (replication) is performed by a poorly characterized replication-transcription complex (RTC) that is comprised of multiple protein subunits (reviewed in (11,12,13)) encoded in two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the nidoviral genomic RNA (Figure 1A). The two polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab, the latter resulting from ribosomal frameshifting during genome translation, are auto-catalytically processed by multiple cognate proteases, one of which (the 3C-like (3CLpro) or main (Mpro) protease) is responsible for the large majority of cleavages (14). Downstream of ORF1b, nidovirus genomes contain multiple smaller ORFs, known as the 3\u2032 ORFs (7), which are expressed from the sg mRNAs described above.",

            "text": "During evolution, most conserved proteins of nidoviruses have diverged more extensively than those of organisms of the Tree of Life. In line with the principal function of each region, genome conservation increases from 3\u2032 ORFs to ORF1a to ORF1b (7). Accordingly, the 3\u2032 ORF region encodes virion proteins and, optionally, accessory proteins that are predominantly group- or family-specific and mediate virus\u2013host interactions (15,16). ORF1a encodes a variable number of proteins that include co-factors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other ORF1b-encoded enzymes, three hydrophobic proteins mediating the association of the RTC with membranes and the viral proteases (13,17,18,19). The latter group includes the 3CLpro, which is the only ORF1a-encoded enzyme conserved in all nidoviruses. In contrast, ORF1b is highly conserved and encodes different RNA-processing enzymes that critically control viral RNA synthesis (Figure 1B). These invariantly include the RdRp and a superfamily 1 helicase domain (HEL1), which is fused with a multinuclear Zn-binding domain (ZBD). RdRp and HEL1 are expressed as part of two different cleavage products residing next to each other in pp1ab (8). The RdRp is believed to mediate the synthesis of all viral RNA molecules, while over the years the unwinding activity of the helicase was implicated in the control of replication, transcription, translation, virion biogenesis, and, most recently, post-transcriptional RNA quality control (reviewed in (20)). Among the lineage-specific proteins encoded in ORF1b are four enzymes. A 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN, in Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) and an N7-methyltransferase (N-MT, in the Coronavirinae subfamily, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) constitute adjacent domains in the same pp1b cleavage product. They were implicated in RNA proofreading (19,21\u201322) and in 5\u2032 end cap formation (23,24), respectively. Downstream of this subunit, nidoviruses encode an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease of unknown function (NendoU, in Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) (25,26) and/or a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) (in Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae), which was implicated in 5\u2032 end cap modification and immune evasion (23,27\u201329). All six ORF1b-encoded enzymes have distantly related viral and/or cellular homologs. Additionally, Roniviridae and Arteriviridae encode family-specific domains of unknown origin and function, RsD (30) and AsD (31,32), respectively.",

RdRps adopt variations of an \u03b1/\u03b2 fold (reviewed in (34)) and have characteristic conserved sequences (motifs). In nidoviruses, these motifs were mapped to the C-terminal one-third of the RdRp-containing protein (35,36), whose tertiary structure is available only as a template-based model for SARS-CoV nsp12 (37,38).",

These assignments were fully corroborated by their subsequent biochemical characterization (25\u201326,29,40\u201345). Furthermore, the (in)tolerance to replacement of active site residues as tested in reverse genetics studies of coronaviruses and arteriviruses in general correlated well with the observed enzyme conservation. Accordingly, the replacement of conserved residues of the nidovirus-wide conserved RdRp, ZBD and HEL1 were lethal (46\u201348), while virus mutants were crippled upon inactivation of ExoN, NendoU or O-MT enzymes (49\u201351), which are conserved in only some of the nidovirus families (30). This correlation is noteworthy since it coherently links the results of the experimental characterization of a few nidoviruses in cell culture systems to evolutionary patterns that were shaped by natural selection in many hosts over an extremely large time frame. The fact that this correlation is evident for nidoviruses overall, rather than for separate families, indicates that nidovirus-wide comparative genomics provides sensible models to the functional characterization of the most conserved replicative proteins.",

Our extensive bioinformatics analysis revealed a novel domain, encoded upstream of the RdRp domain within the same cleavage product. It is conserved in all nidoviruses and has no apparent viral or cellular homologs, making it a second genetic marker for the order Nidovirales. Based on results obtained using EAV and SARS-CoV, this domain was concluded to have an essential nucleotidylation activity and was named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN). Its potential functions in nidovirus replication may include RNA ligation, protein-primed RNA synthesis, and the guanylyltransferase function that is necessary for mRNA capping.",

Twenty nine viruses of the family Mesoniviridae were clustered into six groups, whose intra- and inter-group evolutionary distance was below and above 0.075, respectively. One representative was chosen randomly from each of the six groups. For the Roniviridae family, two viruses, each prototyping a species, were used. To retrieve information about genomes, the SNAD program (55) was used.

We have produced family-wide MSAs of nsp12 of coronaviruses, nsp9 of arteriviruses and their counterparts of mesoniviruses and roniviruses, whose borders have been tentatively mapped through limited similarity with known 3CLpro cleavage sites of these viruses (60,61).

For simplicity, we will refer to the proteins of mesoni- and roniviruses as nsp12t, with \u2018t\u2019 standing for tentative, since the proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyproteins of these viruses remains to be addressed in detail. Besides NiRAN and RdRp, we have also produced family-specific MSAs of three other nidovirus-wide conserved protein domains: 3CLpro, HEL1 and ZBD. Family-specific MSAs of the NiRAN domain were combined in a stepwise manner using the profile mode of ClustalW with subsequent manual local refinement, which was limited and guided by results obtained using HHalign of the HH-suite 2.0.15 software (62,63) when and if the two programs disagreed.

Statistical significance of similarity was measured using % of confidence and expectation value (E). HH-suite calculates those for the best local hit in an MSA, regardless whether the latter was produced using the local or global mode of the program. Consequently, similarity of global MSAs may be underestimated. Based on family-specific MSAs of NiRAN and RdRp, the secondary structure of these domains was predicted using software Jpred 3 (64) and PSIPRED (65). In both cases, the sequence with the least gaps was selected from the sequences forming the MSA. The prediction was made only for columns of the MSA in which the selected sequence does not contain gaps. The MSAs were converted into the final figure using ESPript (66).",

Typically the similarity between a nidovirus query and a target encompassed the entire target and was limited to the C-terminal part of the query, with the N-terminal \u223c250 and 350 amino acid residues remaining unmatched in arteriviruses and other nidoviruses, respectively (Figure 2A). Likewise, the C-terminal part of nsp9/nsp12/nsp12t matched the RdRp profiles of different virus families in PFAM (68) and an in-house database although this analysis was complicated by the presence of nidovirus sequences in the top-hit PFAM profile (see below).

Suffix R and N were added to motif labels of the RdRp and NiRAN domain, respectively. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of NiRAN and RdRp of different (sub)families was performed using PhyML 3.0, with the WAG amino acid substitution matrix, allowing substitution rate heterogeneity among sites (eight categories) and 1000 iterations of non-parametric bootstrapping (75). Pairwise patristic distances (PPDs) between viruses were calculated from these trees using R package \u2018ape\u2019 (76).

Next, the protein was applied to a centrifugal filter (Millipore Microcon, MWCO 30 kDa) and washed three times with NH4HCO3 (25 mM) before a protease digestion was performed with 2 \u03bcg trypsin in 100 \u03bcl NH4HCO3 overnight at RT. Recovered peptides were treated with 50 mM NaOH for 25 min, desalted using Oasis spin columns (Waters) and finally analyzed by on-line nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-FT Ultra (Thermo, Bremen, Germany). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Uniprot database, using mascot version 2.2.04, with a precursor accuracy of 2 ppm and product ion accuracy of 0.5 Da. Carbamidomethyl was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation, N-acetylation (protein N-terminus) and FSBG were set as variable modifications.",

For nsp12t, similar conclusions could be drawn although the conservation profiles of these viruses, especially roniviruses, were of lesser resolution due to the overall higher similarity that was the result of the limited virus sampling and divergence. Importantly, also the N-terminal half of nsp9 and nsp12 (NiRAN domain) included a few above-average conservation peaks although the overall conservation was evidently highest around the established RdRp motifs (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S2). Likewise, NiRAN compared to RdRp accepted two\u2013to-three times more substitutions in four nidovirus (sub)families (Figure 2B). In this comparison, slopes of the four PPD distributions were strikingly similar, particularly in the pairs of the Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (60.6 and 60.5, respectively) and the Mesoniviridae and Arteriviridae (67.9 and 68.1). Thus, NiRAN must have evolved under similar constraints in different lineages of nidoviruses, which is compatible with a common function of this domain.",

Based on these observations, we have aligned the NiRAN domain of coronavirus nsp12 and mesonivirus nsp12t using the profile mode of ClustalW, with the MSA being slightly adjusted taking into account the HHalign-mediated results. This MSA of two families was superior compared to each of the two family-specific MSAs with respect to its similarity to the MSA of roniviruses (\u223c54\u201375% confidence and E = 0.00011\u20130.00049). Consequently, the ronivirus MSA was added to the MSA of corona/toro- and mesoniviruses to generate an MSA of the NiRAN of the three families, hereafter called ExoN-encoding nidoviruses with reference to the domain that distinguishes this group from arteriviruses (Figure 1B).

This could be due to the similarity being recognized only in a small C-terminal region. This experience prompted us to compare conserved motifs and predicted secondary structures of the domains of these families (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Ten residues were found to be invariant in the conserved NiRAN of the ExoN-encoding nidoviruses. They map to three motifs designated AN (with a K-x[6\u20139]-E pattern in ExoN-encoding nidoviruses), BN (R-x[8\u20139]-D) and CN (T-x-DN-x4-G-x[2,4]-DF), respectively, with motifs BN and CN representing the most prominent conservation peaks of this domain in coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure S2). Remarkably, similar conserved motifs are present in the NiRAN of arteriviruses (Figure 2A and C), where BN and CN again occupy the two most prominent peaks (Supplementary Figure S2). The three motifs are similarly positioned relative to the ORF1a/ORF1b frameshift signal in all nidoviruses, and, importantly, they were aligned in arteriviruses and the ExoN-encoding nidoviruses using HHalign in global mode (Figure 3, rightmost plot). Specifically, all four invariant residues of motifs AN and BN of ExoN-encoding nidoviruses are also conserved in arteriviruses although with slightly smaller distances separating the two residues of each pair (Supplementary Figure S1 and Figure 2C). In the most highly conserved motif CN, the aspartate-phenylalanine dipeptide and likely glycine (the only deviating arginine at this position in the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus isolate U15146 may result from a sequencing error) are absolutely conserved among nidoviruses while the other invariant residues of ExoN-encoding nidoviruses appear to have been replaced by similar residues in arteriviruses. Additionally, there is a good agreement between the predicted secondary structure for the domains of arteriviruses and ExoN-encoding nidoviruses, particularly in the area encompassing the three sequence motifs as well as regions immediately upstream of motif AN (named preAN motif) and downstream of motif CN (Supplementary Figure S1). In ExoN-encoding nidoviruses, motifs BN and CN are separated by a variable region of 40\u201360 amino acid residues that does not include absolutely conserved residues, while in arteriviruses motifs BN and CN are adjacent. Based on these observations, we concluded that nsp9, nsp12 and nsp12t contain the NiRAN domain, which is conserved in all nidoviruses, although we acknowledge that the support for the conservation of different motifs between different nidovirus (sub)families is not equally strong. Also, we noted that, at this stage, it was not possible to precisely define the C-terminal border of the NiRAN domain. NiIRAN and RdRp may thus, be adjacent or separated by another small domain of variable size in different nidoviruses (Supplementary Figure S2).",

We expected to find hits to either other nidovirus proteins, if NiRAN would have emerged by duplication or non-nidovirus proteins, if the NiRAN ancestor would have been acquired from an external source. None of the database scans involving the NiRAN retrieved a non-nidovirus hit whose E-value was better than 0.065 for HMMER and 1.3 for the HHsearch program from HH-suite (Figure 4) and none of these hits had sequences similar to the motifs of the NiRAN. In contrast, statistically significant hits with virus and/or host proteins were identified for the nidoviral control proteins either in both or one of the scans; according to annotation, at least some of these hits were true positives in the functional and/or structural sense. Likewise, in scans of the PDB using pGenTHREADER, all top hits for the NiRAN of the four virus families had low support (P = 0.014 or worse) with no match of the conserved motifs.

The data were most compatible with the hypothesis that this domain is an RNA processing enzyme, in view of (i) the abundance of RNA processing enzymes in the ORF1b-encoded polyprotein (Figure 1B); and (ii) the profile of invariant residues, composed of aspartate, glutamate, lysine, arginine and phenylalanine (and possibly glycine) (Figure 2C), the first four of which are among the most frequently employed catalytic residues (85). Since the domain is uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, we hypothesized that its activity might work in concert with that of another, similarly unique RNA processing enzyme. At the time of this consideration, the NendoU endoribonuclease of nidoviruses was believed to be such an enzyme (25) (assessment revised in 2011, (30)). Consequently, we reasoned that a ligase function would be a natural counterpart for the endoribonuclease (NendoU), as observed in many biological processes, and would fit in the functional cooperation framework outlined in our previous analysis of the SARS-CoV proteome (39). This hypothesis was also compatible with the predicted \u03b1/\u03b2 structural organization of NiRAN (Supplementary Figure S1) and the lack of detectable similarity between NiRAN and the highly diverse nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, to which nucleic acid ligases belong. This superfamily is known to include groups that differ even in the most conserved sequence motifs, especially in proteins of viral origin (86,87). Based on mechanistic insights obtained with other ligases, we expected that the conserved lysine might be the principal catalytic residue of the NiRAN domain.",

First, an NTP molecule, typically adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is bound to the enzyme's binding pocket, and a covalent bond is established between the nucleotide's \u03b1-phosphate, nucleoside-5'-monophosphate (NMP) and the side chain of either lysine or histidine, while pyrophosphate is released. Since this protein\u2013NMP is a true, temporarily stable intermediate, it can be readily detected by biochemical methods. In contrast, demonstration of the following two steps, NMP transfer to the 5\u2032 phosphate of an RNA substrate and subsequent ligation of a second RNA molecule under release of the NMP, depends on the availability of target RNA sequences whose identification is often not as straightforward. Thus, we first assessed our hypothesis by testing the covalent binding of a nucleotide, known as nucleotidylation.",

As can be seen in Figure 5A, we could indeed detect a radioactively labeled product with a mobility comparable to that of nsp9 in the presence of GTP and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP). To verify that this labeled band corresponded to a protein and did not result from 3\u2032 end labeling of co-purified E. coli RNA or polyG synthesis by the RNA polymerase residing in the C-terminal domain of nsp9, guanylylation was followed by the addition of either proteinase K or RNase T1, which cleaves single-stranded RNA after G residues. As expected, only protease treatment removed the band while incubation with RNase T1 had no effect on the product (Figure 5B). The same result was obtained after uridylylation using RNase A, which cleaves after pyrimidines in single-stranded RNA (data not shown). Furthermore, as the use of GTP labeled in the \u03b3-position did not result in a radioactive product, we conclude that this phosphate, in agreement with the general nucleotidylation mechanism, is released during the reaction (Figure 5B).",

In contrast, we observed no covalent binding with ATP or cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) as substrates (Figure 5A). The observed substrate preferences are remarkable for two reasons. First, since both UTP and GTP are present in significantly lower concentrations under physiological conditions than ATP (89) and are in general not used as primary energy source, it suggests that the identity of the base, rather than the energy stored within the phosphodiester bonds, may be critical for a subsequent step in the reaction pathway. This implies that reaction pathways other than RNA ligation, which predominantly utilizes ATP, must be considered. Second, the selective utilization of only one pyrimidine and one purine substrate raised questions about the nature and number of active sites involved, for instance, whether both nucleotides bind to separate binding sites or utilize different catalytic residues within the same binding site. Unfortunately, there are no crystal structures for any of the nidovirus nsp9/nsp12/nsp12t subunits available to date, which might have been used to resolve this matter in docking studies.",

Interestingly, while the relative activities below pH 8.5 were identical with both substrates, the relative guanylylation activity was exceedingly higher than uridylylation at a pH above 8.5 (Figure 6A). To exclude that the observed pattern is due to a difference in the metal ion requirement, we determined the optimal manganese concentration for nucleotidylation with both substrates. As is apparent from Figure 6B, both activities share the same broad optimum between 6 and 10 mM MnCl2. This result made it unlikely that manganese oxidation and a concomitant decrease of available Mn2+ ions, as we observed at a pH above 9.0, would selectively favour the utilization of one of the two substrates. The observed difference between guanylylation and uridylylation with regard to its pH optimum may thus be genuine. For instance, this slightly broadened or\u2014more likely\u2014shifted pH optimum of guanylylation may be the result of a GTP-induced spatial reorientation of amino acid side chains in the vicinity of the catalytic residue and a concomitant alteration of its pKa. Alternatively, it may also be explained by the two substrates using different binding sites. These possibilities were partially addressed in the experiments described in the subsequent sections.",

In agreement with previously published results (78), we found only lysine and tyrosine residues to be modified, as these are thought to provide the chemically most stable bonds. The selectivity of the modification was evident from the fact that only seven lysine and tyrosine residues served as nucleophile for the reaction. Furthermore, we identified all these peptides in independent experiments using FSBG concentrations ranging from 25 \u03bcM to 2 mM. Within this range, a concentration of 100 \u03bcM was sufficient to detect all seven peptides. Together this strongly suggests that the reaction with FSBG only occurred after binding to a specific site(s) and did not originate from random collisions. Furthermore, the two modified residues in the EAV RdRp are located in either a predicted \u03b1-helix or in a loop not far upstream and downstream of the AR and ER motifs, respectively, which are involved in NTP binding in other, better characterized RdRps. The five modified residues in the EAV NiRAN domain are poorly conserved in related arteriviruses and are located in the vicinity of one of the three major motifs in either a predicted loop region (1 residue) or a \u03b2-strand (4 residues). These findings are compatible with the expected properties of the FSBG modification that may label any nucleophile within a 4 \u00c5 distance from the NTP-binding site(s). We therefore conclude that the peptides identified in this experiment reflect the presence of a nucleotide binding site within the RdRp required for RNA synthesis and a second binding site that is located in the NiRAN domain, which could serve for nucleotidylation.",

Notably, none of these mutations significantly reduced expression or stability (data not shown), indicating that they are most likely compatible with the protein's structure. Subsequent characterization demonstrated that all conserved NiRAN residues that were probed (Figure 2, Table 1) are important for nucleotidylation activity, as their replacement with alanine led, with the exception of S129A, to a drop to below 10% of wild-type protein activity. In contrast, alanine substitution of a non-conserved N-terminal residue (K106A) as well as of a conserved residue in the RdRp domain (D445A of motif AR), which is known to be essential for the polymerase activity in other RNA viruses (34), had only a mild effect, preserving at least 75% of the activity (Figure 7). Thus, we concluded that the identified sequence motifs in the EAV nsp9 NiRAN domain are functionally connected to the nucleotidylation activity. Whether the decrease in activity was due to a loss of affinity, impairment of catalysis or both remains to be established. In addition, as the level of remaining activity (again with exception of the S129A mutant) did not depend on the substrate used, both guanylylation and uridylylation are likely catalyzed by the same active site.",

This finding may indicate that S129 is specifically involved in the hydrogen bond network between protein and UTP. Alternatively, as the covalent binding of the nucleotide occurs via a nucleophilic attack on the \u03b1-phosphate, this serine may in principle be suitable to play this role.

We therefore concluded that there is only one active site responsible for nucleotidylation, which allows utilization of both substrates. Interestingly, if this were true, discrimination of GTP and UTP against ATP and CTP would be solely based on the presence of an oxygen at C6 of GTP and C4 of UTP. However, given the pronounced size difference between UTP and GTP, the positions of both substrates within the binding site are unlikely to be equivalent. In principle, two binding scenarios are possible. First, the ribose and phosphate moieties of both nucleotides could occupy the same position within the binding site, for example by forming hydrogen bonds via the ribose's 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 hydroxyl groups and charge interactions between the protein and the phosphates. Yet, due to the size difference of the bases (pyrimidine vs. purine), any additional interactions between protein and bases would involve different hydrogen bond networks, potentially involving water molecules in the case of the smaller UTP. Alternatively, due to stacking interactions between an aromatic residue of the protein and the bases, uracil and the pyrimidine ring of guanine might occupy equivalent positions. As this would inevitably lead to the relative misplacement of the ribose and phosphates of UTP compared to GTP, the catalytic residue may compensate for the size difference by re-adjusting and attacking the \u03b2- instead of the \u03b1-phosphate of UTP.",

The nucleotide-protein bond was subsequently broken by lowering of the pH and the released nucleotide was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. While nsp9 incubated with GTP clearly released significantly more of the expected guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) in an acidic environment than under alkaline conditions, the results after uridylylation were not as conclusive. Although also in this case the monophosphate was released after HCl treatment, the intensity did not match that of GMP and a second product was present in higher quantities (Figure 9A). This may indicate that uridine-5'-monophosphate (UMP) is either further hydrolyzed under these conditions or that in fact a UMP\u2013protein adduct is only the minor product after uridylylation. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the binding of UTP indeed forces an attack of the \u03b2-phosphate. To exclude that the observed GMP release is caused by the treatment with HCl, control samples lacking nsp9 were also investigated. As expected this did not result in a product with equivalent mobility to GMP (Figure 9B).",

Following transfection of in vitro-transcribed full-length RNA into permissive cells, viral protein expression and progeny release were monitored (Table 1). As expected for such conserved residues, most alanine substitutions were either lethal for the virus or resulted in a severely crippled virus that reverted, thus confirming the essential role of the nucleotidylation activity during the viral replication cycle. Similarly, also replacement of a conserved aspartate in motif A of the downstream RdRp domain, which is known to be required for the activity of polymerases in other (+) RNA viruses (34), was tolerated in neither EAV nor SARS-CoV. Notable exceptions to this general pattern, in addition to the replacements of non-conserved lysine residues included as controls, were the T123A and F219A mutations in SARS-CoV nsp12. These mutations were stably maintained although they produced a mixed plaque phenotype comprising wild-type-sized and smaller plaques, with F219A also demonstrating a markedly lower progeny titer (at least two logs reduced) than the wild-type control (Figure 10). The reason for this differential behavior of these two SARS-CoV mutants in comparison to those of EAV is unclear at the moment.",

Even the similarity between the arteriviral NiRAN and that of other nidoviruses was found to be marginal. These results suggested that NiRAN either is a unique enzyme specific to nidoviruses or has diverged from its paralogs beyond recognition, i. e. to an extent that cannot be ascertain by even the most powerful HMM-based tools currently available. The latter possibility is not merely hypothetical given that five out of the seven amino acid residues that are evolutionary invariant in the NiRAN domain belong to the most common residues found in proteins.

Also, the significance of NiRAN for virus replication must be different from that of NendoU, the only other ORF1b-encoded enzyme that has been probed extensively by mutagenesis in reverse genetics in both corona- and arteriviruses (25,50,92).

Nucleotidylation was most pronounced with UTP as substrate but was also observed with GTP (Figure 5A). Despite their size difference, both substrates appeared to be utilized by the same NiRAN binding site since uridylylation as well as guanylylation depended on the same conserved residues. To our knowledge such dual specificity has never been reported for a protein of an RNA virus and (likely) a host. Our results strongly suggested the nucleotidylated residue to be either a lysine or a histidine (Figure 8) located in the N-terminal part of nsp9.

The nucleotidylated fraction of the total protein pool depends on many factors, including the adduct's stability, and remains unknown. However, this uncertainty does not undermine the validity of the established nucleotidylation activity of nsp9, given the specificity and selectivity documented here, which were determined using different techniques and various controls to arrive at a consistent set of properties of the enzyme. Combined, the results of our biochemical and bioinformatics analyses assigned nucleotidylation activity to the NiRAN domain beyond a reasonable doubt.

            "text": "Next to K94 and/or conserved R124 of motif BN, which may mediate NTP binding via interactions with the negatively charged phosphates, a third conserved residue which may contribute to NTP binding is the motif CN phenylalanine (F166 in EAV). Since phenylalanine would most likely interact with the nucleotide substrate by base stacking, its contribution in terms of binding energy would be one order of magnitude lower than that of electrostatic interactions of lysine/arginine with the phosphates (94). Based solely on this consideration, F166 could be expected to be of \u2018lesser\u2019 importance than the basic residues. However, this was apparently not the case since the replacement of the aromatic residue with alanine was lethal for EAV while substitution of either of the basic residues led to a low level of replication that eventually facilitated reversion (Table 1). All these substitutions require two nucleotide point mutations to revert back to wild-type, which should be an extremely rare event during a single round of replication. Consequently, the non-viable phenotype of the F166A mutant may hint at a lower tolerance of single-nucleotide partial revertants (F166V or F166S) in comparison to those originating from K94A (K94T or K94E) and R124A (R124P or R124G). Alternatively, the observed non-viable F166A phenotype may be explained by a vital interaction between NiRAN and RdRp or other proteins involving F166. In contrast to EAV, the homologous residue in SARS-CoV nsp12, F219, appeared to be less essential since its replacement merely reduced progeny titers and altered the plaque phenotype, while the nucleotide changes were maintained. At present, the exact reason for this difference between EAV and SARS-CoV is unclear, but it suggests that the role and/or regulation of this conserved phenylalanine may have evolved in these distantly related nidoviruses, whose NiRAN domains are of strikingly different sizes; such evolution has parallels in other enzymes (95).",

The conserved serine/threonine of motif BN could be a candidate as substitution of this serine in EAV nsp9 (S129) was the only mutation that had a differential effect on guanylylation and uridylylation (Figure 7). Finally, in agreement with observations for other nucleotidylate-forming enzymes (96\u201398), also nsp9 nucleotidylation is metal-dependent (Figure 5B), potentially due to an important role for metal ions in coordination of the triphosphate or charge neutralization of the pyrophosphate leaving group. In our in vitro system it was Mn2+ rather than the most common divalent cation Mg2+ that supported nucleotidylation activity when tested over a wide concentration range. We propose that at least one of the three acidic conserved residues (E100, D132 and D165 in EAV nsp9) is directly involved in the binding of this essential manganese ion(s). Since the concentration of this cation in cells is lower than that required to observe nucleotidylation in vitro, we cannot exclude the possibility that another co-factor or substrate modulates this property of the enzyme in vivo, and/or that another metal ion is used.",

            "text": "We initially considered NiRAN to be a non-canonical ATP-dependent RNA ligase. It was reasoned that, in the context of nidovirus replication, such an activity could be the functional complement of the NendoU endoribonuclease (7). Moreover, at that time both enzymes were considered to have been conserved across all taxa during evolution of the nidovirus lineage. However, it recently became clear that NendoU is conserved only in nidoviruses infecting vertebrate hosts. Consequently, our original hypothesis would not explain why this putative ligase would be conserved in roni- and mesoniviruses, which do not encode the endoribonuclease. Another complication regarding that original hypothesis has emerged from the present study, which identified NiRAN as being UTP/GTP-specific. Although the hydrolysis of all NTPs results in the release of the same amount of energy, ATP-dependent RNA ligases dominate the ligase family. It would therefore be surprising, if nidoviruses encoded a ligase that strongly discriminates against ATP. To our knowledge the GTP-specific tRNA-splicing ligase RtcB is the only currently known example of a protein involved in nucleic acid strand joining exhibiting this kind of substrate specificity (90). Furthermore, thus far no substrates that would require a ligase function were identified in nidovirus replication, which however remains poorly characterized in general.",

Intriguingly, three of the four enzyme activities required for cap formation and modification, namely an RNA-triphosphatase and two methyltransferases, have been identified in coronaviruses (44,100), with the missing activity being the GTase. Furthermore, recent characterization of EAV nsp10 in our lab (unpublished data) showed that it resembles its coronavirus homolog in terms of possessing RNA-triphosphatase activity, which is required prior to GTase activity in the conventional capping pathway. In line with these findings, experimental evidence supporting the presence of a cap structure on genomic RNA was reported for three very distantly related viruses of the Nidovirales order, namely for MHV (Coronavirinae) (101), Equine torovirus (Torovirinae) (102) and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Arteriviridae) (103). Importantly, the known GTases of (+) RNA viruses, flavivirus NS5 (104), alphavirus nsP1 and orthologous proteins (97,105), do neither share conserved features nor do they resemble host GTases. Thus, the possibility of NiRAN being a cap-synthesizing GTase could be reconciled with our current knowledge of the structural and sequence diversity of this class of enzymes. This cannot be said, however, about NiRAN's substrate preference for UTP over GTP, which has not been reported for GTases mediating cap formation.",

This strategy is used by many viruses including the large group of picornavirus-like viruses, which notably have evolutionary affinity to nidoviruses (35,36). In these viruses, a nucleotide is covalently attached to a protein that is commonly known as VPg (viral protein genome-linked), which may then be extended to a dinucleotide. This dinucleotide is subsequently base-paired to the 3\u2032 end of the viral RNA where it serves as primer for the synthesis of the complementary RNA strand (106). Interestingly, the first nucleotide of the EAV genome is a G while the 3\u2032 end is equipped with a poly(A) tail. Thus, the dual specificity of nsp9 for GTP and UTP would be compatible with the different requirements for the initiation of the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs of positive and negative polarity, respectively. To which extent this property is conserved across nidoviruses remains to be established.",

            "text": "While considering this mechanism, it is instructive to take into account observations that distinguish nidoviruses from VPg-utilizing viruses. First, to our knowledge, all currently described nucleotide-VPg bonds are realized via the hydroxyl group of either a tyrosine or a serine/threonine (107\u2013111), while NiRAN most likely uses the invariant lysine residue (Figure 8). This problem could be resolved if NiRAN assumes the role of the RdRp of VPg-encoding viruses and transfers the bound nucleotide to another protein that subsequently serves as VPg. Second, at least for coronaviruses, the VPg-based mechanism would not be compatible with the previously proposed primase-based mechanism (112) for the initiation of RNA synthesis. However, the latter mechanism remains tentative since it assigns primase activity to a protein complex that, according to a recent study (84), may merely be a processivity co-factor for the nsp12 RdRp. Finally, as mentioned before, the mRNAs of several nidoviruses were concluded to be capped at their 5\u2032 end, a modification that is not observed in known VPg-utilizing viruses. To use both VPg priming and capping, it would be necessary to actively or passively remove the attached protein in order to allow mRNA capping to commence. This sequence of events would constitute a novel, and perhaps unlikely, variant of the capping pathway, as the RNA's 5\u2032 end would not be di- or triphosphorylated after VPg removal, a requirement for entering any of the known viral capping pathways (99). Thus, if NiRAN would be part of a VPg-utilizing mechanism, this might differ considerably from those currently described and could possibly also vary among nidoviruses.",
