Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (figure 1). The mean age of the athletes (n=45) was 27 (SD 6) years and the mean age of the staff members (n=68) was 44 (SD 9). Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. The team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days (with a range of 10\u201332 days). They lived in groups of 5\u20136 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats.",

In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%.30 31 These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults.9 10 A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%\u201390% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections.13 32 The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (table 1). Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea.

Two patients seemed to transmit the illness to another team member during the flight. Long-haul air travel is a well-known risk factor for the transmission of contagious diseases. One person with influenza can transmit the infection to 5\u201310 people during an intercontinental flight.33 Two cases of coronavirus OC43 infection were most probably travelling during the incubation period of the infection (3.5 days) and developed the illness within 2\u20133 days after arrival in the Olympic Village.27 34 In addition, the first cases of rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections were detected during the first week, suggesting that these infections also originated in Finland.34 In addition to direct or indirect contact and droplets, respiratory viruses can spread via exhaled aerosols, even while talking.35 36 Viruses may stay infectious on a surface for hours or days. The most commonly detected coronavirus 229E, stays infectious on common surfaces for at least 7 days.37 Interestingly, it was recently shown that viruses can also spread through toilet flushing.38 Ultimately, 7 clusters of different respiratory virus infections were recorded. Important factors in the transmission of the viruses were the housing with other athletes and the sport discipline (table 1). Competition venues may be a favourable environment for virus transmission. Rigorous hand washing, the use of hand sanitisers, enhanced disinfection and strict patient isolation were likely to prevent the spread of viruses within the team but were apparently not very effective (figure 2). This is due to the multifactorial transmission mechanisms of viral infections.39\n",
