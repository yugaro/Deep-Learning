Resting memory CD4+ T cells in the blood are the best characterized cellular HIV\u20101 reservoirs.4 However, there are other sites of HIV persistence in the body. The brain is unique in terms of its \u201cimmune privileged\u201d status and evidence does suggest that the brain is a viral reservoir for HIV\u20101.5, 6 In brain, macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes can be infected by HIV\u20101; HIV\u20101 infection of macrophages and microglia is more productive than astrocytes.7 Although endocytosis is involved in HIV\u20101 entry in both macrophages7, 8 and astrocytes,7 different receptors are used for HIV\u20101 entry in macrophages or astrocytes and this could help explain the restrictive nature of HIV\u20101 infection in astrocytes. It has been reported that up to 19% astrocytes carry HIV\u20101 DNA in HIV\u20101 infected brain9, 10 and because of their abundance, astrocytes could be an important viral reservoir in the brain.",

For these studies we blocked TPC with Ned\u201019, TRPML with ML\u2010SI1, TRPM2 with flufenamic acid, P2X4 with 5\u2010BDBD, P\u2010type calcium channel with \u03c9\u2010agatoxin TK, and L\u2010type calcium channels with verapamil. Ned\u201019 significantly inhibited Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Figure 3E), but none of the other calcium channel blockers significantly affected Tat\u2010induced LTR transactivation (Figure 3A\u2010D). However, verapamil at the high concentration of 50 \u03bcM did significantly inhibit Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation (Figure 3F), but it is likely that this was due to its ability to block TPCs at such high concentrations.62 Using the newer TPC blockers tetrandrine and fangchinoline63, 64, 65 at subtoxic concentrations of 0.5 and 1 \u00b5M66 we showed that tetrandrine (Figure 3G) and fangchinoline (Figure 3H) both significantly attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Thus, our pharmacological studies suggest strongly that blocking TPC attenuates Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation.",

Indeed, we demonstrated that chloroquine induced the endolysosome leakage of fluorescent\u2010dextran and galectin\u20103 (Supplementary Figure S1). Significantly, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 significantly attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced endolysosome leakage of fluorescent\u2010dextran (Figure 4C); Ned\u201019 attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced increases in cytosolic green dextran fluorescence and decreases in endolysosome green dextran fluorescence. In addition, using the galectin\u20103 puncta assay we found that Ned\u201019 significantly reduced chloroquine\u2010induced endolysosome leakage (Figure 4D); Ned\u201019 attenuated chloroquine\u2010induced increases in the number of galectin\u20103 puncta.

In particular, the inhibition of or the absence of TPCs blocks the entry of the Ebola virus into the host cell62, 63 and impairs the progression of MERS\u2010CoV through the endolysosome system.64 Consistent with these findings, our findings provide evidence that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR activation. First, we demonstrated that a set of pharmacological blockers (Ned\u201019, verapamil, tetrandrine, and fangchinoline) of TPCs attenuated Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Second, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned\u201019 attenuated general endolysosome leakage as well as specific Tat endolysosome escape. Third, the knockdown of TPC1 or TPC2 attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. These effects were selective to TPCs because knocking down the endolysosome\u2010resident TRPML1 did not affect Tat endolysosome escape or subsequent Tat\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. Our findings suggest that blocking TPCs exert a general protective against the leakage of endolysosomes and especially the escape of larger molecules (MW \u2265 10 000) from endolysosomes because pharmacologically blocking TPCs attenuated the leakage of dextran (10 kDa) and increased the accumulation of galectin\u20103 (26 kDa), and because knocking down TPC1 enhanced Tat (14 kDa)\u2010mediated LTR transactivation. However, knockdown TPC2 had a modest effect on endolysosome escape of the 29\u2010amino acid GFP\u03b211\u2010Tat peptide (MW ~ 3.5 kDa) used in the Tat endolysosome escape assay possibly due to enhanced internalization of Tat\u2010FITC.",

            "text": "The significance of these findings is threefold. First, because Tat is essential for HIV\u20101 replication and important for the activation of latent HIV reservoir, our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape indicate that TPCs might be involved in latent HIV\u20101 infection especially in cells that require endocytosis for HIV\u20101 virus entry. Thus, blocking TPCs represent a novel therapeutic strategy against latent HIV\u20101 infection. Second, Tat is a neurotoxic protein, and the neurotoxic effect could result from Tat disturbing endolysosome function or Tat disturbing the function of other organelles such as mitochondria following Tat endolysosome escape. Thus, Ned\u201019, by inhibiting endolysosome leakage and preventing Tat endolysosome escape, may ameliorate Tat\u2010induced neurotoxicity and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV\u2010associated neurological comorbidities. It is important to note that the advantage of blocking TPCs as a therapeutic strategy is that TPC1 as well as TPC2 knockout mice do not have a reduced life span or an obvious reduction in quality of life.97 Third, it is well known that Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane and has been used to transport a variety of macromolecules into a plethora of cell types.105, 106, 107, 108 Our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat\u2010endolysosome escape provide TPCs as a novel target for enhancing the transport of macromolecules into cells. Although we explored the involvement of TPCs in Tat endolysosome escape in the present study, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Thus, further mechanistic studies are warranted.",
