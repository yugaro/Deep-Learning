            "text": "When a viral infection threatens cells, one of the first measures they take is to induce apoptosis to restrict viral replication and spread.1, 2, 3 Dying this way, host cells are likely to generate specific signals aiming at triggering the immune system with innate and/or adaptative responses allowing the eradication of the invader.4, 5 On the other hand, viruses have evolved a huge arsenal of strategies meant to either counteract or deal with this destructive process to ensure their survival.6, 7, 8 Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by characteristic morphological changes (cellular rounding-up and volume reduction, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blebbing\u2026) and at a molecular level by the activation of first initiator and then effector cysteinyl aspartate proteinases or caspases.9, 10 Activated caspases act through a catalytic Cys that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the substrate, with a stringent specificity for Asp residue at P1 position (the nature of residues at positions P2, P3 and P4 depending on the caspase). Caspase substrates include a large number and variety of cellular proteins that participate through their cleavage to the strong apoptosis-related morphological changes, as well as other physiological processes. Interestingly, viral proteins are also likely to be cleaved by caspases but until 2004, only four of them were reported as such and suggested as advantaging the associated viruses through their cleavage.11 Since, their number has greatly increased and at least 16 viruses are now known to express proteins that undergo caspase cleavage. Here, we aim at updating these cleavages and discussing their biological relevance. From apoptosis inhibition to the improvement or attenuation of viral amplification, caspase cleavage of VPs highlights a potential new fascinating viral strategy to handle apoptosis induction.",

On permissive infection, AMDV induces caspase activation that is necessary for viral amplification.22 This requirement was associated with NS1 protein being cleaved through two caspase 3 sites leading to five NS1-related products.23 When one site is mutated within AMDV molecular clones, the viral production is strongly reduced and even aborted when both sites are disrupted. Interestingly, wild-type (WT) NS1 protein, which exerts replicative and transcriptional functions, is mostly nuclear, but when one of its cleavage sites is disrupted, the protein remains cytosolic resulting in a dramatic decrease in NS1-dependent viral protein (VP) expression. NS1-related C-terminal products, also nuclear, are suggested to be actively involved in the transport of WT NS1. Therefore, on apoptosis induction, full replication occurs, leading to permissive infection. Conversely, without caspase activation, AMDV amplification would be limited and that might allow this lytic virus to establish persistent infection.",

SARS-CoV leads to either permissive or persistent infection, with strong cytopathic effects and high viral titers or the opposite, respectively. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid protein (N), that has both structural and non-structural functions, is proteolytically processed in cells undergoing a lytic cycle or ectopically expressing the protein.29 Using a pharmalogical approach, N protein was demonstrated to be targeted by caspases 3 and 6. On permissive infection, N protein localizes in both cytosol and nucleus while remaining cytosolic in cells undergoing persistent infection. Moreover, preventing N from translocating to the nucleus by mutating its nuclear localization signal abolishes its cleavage by caspases. Thus, permissive infection is associated with N being translocated to the nucleus and possibly its ensuing caspase cleavage. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying viral replication, N subcellular localization and N caspase processing are unknown so far.",

In vitro, caspase 7, which is activated on KSHV reactivation, and to a lesser extent caspases 5 and 10, are able to process ORF57 at 30DETD33\u2193. Interestingly, coexpression assays show that ORF57 cleavage product (i.e. ORF57 lacking residues 1\u201333) is no longer able to promote viral lytic gene expression. Accordingly, complementing a stable cell line containing an orf57-null KSHV genome with ectopic WT or uncleavable ORF57 promotes lytic gene expression, while ORF57 lacking residues 1\u201333 does not. Consistently, the number of cell-free virus particles dramatically increases when caspase 7 is inhibited. Thus, ORF57 cleavage would prevent proper expression of its downstream targets and subsequent full reactivation of KSHV, suggesting that it allows KSHV to maintain a persistent infection.",

Interestingly, AMDV capsid proteins VP1 and 2 are also processed by caspases on viral infection or ectopic expression.31 The cleavage generates a stable 26-kDa product, VPx, and can be partly prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of caspases 6, 8, 9 and 10, and completely by a pan caspase inhibitor. Besides, VP protein expression in either transfected or AMDV-infected cells mainly activates caspase 10, followed by caspases 6, 9, 3 and 7, with caspase 7 as the more efficient in VP cleavage in vitro. Altogether, these data argue for the involvement of several caspases in VP cleavage. AMDV-G strain grows more efficiently at 31.8 \u00b0C than 37 \u00b0C. The alteration of the caspase site within AMDV-G increases both VP and genomic copies production at the non-optimal temperature of 37 \u00b0C and shows no significant effects at 31.8 \u00b0C, suggesting that VP caspase cleavage attenuates AMDV-G life cycle. In vivo AMDV-G infection might thus be regulated by active caspases because it only occurs at 37 \u00b0C. Interestingly, NS1 cleavage favors viral DNA replication while VP processing would limit the packaging of progeny virions. As it is possible that both NS1 and VP cleavages do not inevitably occur simultaneously depending on the pattern of activated caspases, it would result in either effective or attenuated viral replication and allow the virus to spread or persist.",

However H-1PV is able to activate caspases in non-transformed cells, leading to the cleavage of NS1, a non-structural protein (NS) notably involved in viral DNA replication and gene expression by transactivating P38 promoter, which controls the synthesis of capsid proteins. Cleaved NS1 protein (named NS1-Nterm) lacks its C-terminal transactivation domain. When ectopically expressed, NS1-Nterm acts as a dominant negative on NS1-driven P38 promoter transactivation, and dramatically decreases viral production. Moreover, a molecular clone expressing an uncleavable version of NS1 tends to generate more virions. As cancer cells are often refractory to proper apoptotic induction, we propose that H-1PV oncotropism is due, at least in part, to the inability of cancer cells to cleave NS1 protein, thus allowing strong virus production. On the other hand, NS1 cleavage would act as a sensor of antiviral defenses and accordingly attenuate viral amplification, likely to favor persistent infection (our unpublished results).",

            "text": "There are clear evidences concerning the relevance of viral protein caspase cleavages in the physiology of viruses (Figure 1). Coherently, such a modification is used to directly fight apoptosis and AcMNPV as well as WSSV express proteins acting as strong and broad inhibitor caspase substrates. For other viruses, caspase cleavage probably allows the removal of specific regions that reveals or eliminates functional domains or signals. In some cases, this leads to full viral amplification (AMDV NS1, HPV E1), with the striking example of AMDV NS1 protein that needs to be cleaved by caspases to translocate to the nucleus and eventually exert its functions. On the contrary, caspase cleavage can result in the attenuation of the virus by generating new viral products acting as dominant negatives of NS proteins (H-1PV NS1, KSHV ORF57) or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned (AMDV VP and possibly FCV capsid protein). Interestingly, such attenuation at a cellular level might hold importance regarding the possibility for viruses to establish permissive and/or persistent infection at a higher scale (i.e. multicellular organisms). The functional consequences of some viral protein caspase cleavages still remain debated or elusive because of the difficulty of investigating hazardous entities (influenza, HCV), the multitude of strains and genotypes (influenza, HCV, adenovirus) or the lack of appropriate tools such as cellular or animal models allowing to recapitulate the viral life cycle (TGEV, MCV). When caspase cleavages of viral proteins work in too mysterious ways, it is sometimes concluded that they constitute a mechanism of degradation resulting from the host fighting back the infection. However, the caspase-related products detected are mostly stable, suggesting they could be somehow involved in the viral life cycle as mentioned right above. Besides, knowing how high the mutation rates of viruses can be,50 or that some viral oncoproteins (like v-Rel) adapted to resist caspase cleavage through evolution unlike their cellular counterparts,51 keeping caspase cleavage sites seems very unlikely if viruses do not somehow profit from them. As caspase cleavage of viral proteins occurs in all sorts of proteins (structural or non-structural) and in all sorts of viruses (DNA as well as RNA), this suggests that it constitutes a strong strategy to handle apoptosis. By managing to use the molecular effectors of apoptosis to protect themselves from eradication without any additional genetic information required, viruses prove once again how fascinating their adaptability can be.",
