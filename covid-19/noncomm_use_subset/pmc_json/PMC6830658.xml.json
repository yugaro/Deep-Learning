The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence.5 10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen.11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups.12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive programme, the Shenzhen Programme for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults.13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults.",

Among them, 733 (28.2%) were both TPPA and TRUST positive, 728 (28.0%) were only TPPA positive, and 1136 (43.7%) were false positive (figure 1). The overall prevalence of syphilis seropositivity was 370.1 per 100 000 (95% CI 351.1 to 389.0 per 100 000), and the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI 172.2 to 199.1 per 100 000). The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity and active infection was higher among females than males (syphilis seropositivity: \u03c72=60.4, p<0.001; active infection: \u03c72=36.1, p<0.001) and showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2017 (syphilis seropositivity: \u03c72\ntrend=27.1, p trend<0.001; active infection: \u03c72\ntrend=7.8, p trend=0.005). People aged \u226545 years reported the highest prevalence of both syphilis seropositivity and active infection, which was 3.8 times (OR 3.8; 95% CI 3.1 to 4.6) and 2.4 times (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.9 to 3.0) higher than that among people aged <25 years, and 2.3 times (OR 2.3; 95% CI 2.0 to 2.6) and 1.8 times (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.5 to 2.2) higher than that among people aged 25\u201334 years, respectively. Trend analysis showed that the prevalence of syphilis seropositivity (\u03c72\ntrend=311.9, p trend<0.001) and active infection (\u03c72\ntrend=72.1, p trend<0.001) increased significantly with age (table 2). After stratification by gender and year of donation, the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained (ptrend<0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection among males (\u03c72\ntrend=0.923, p trend=0.337) and females (\u03c72\ntrend=0.224, p trend=0.636) in 2014 (figure 2).",

First, limited financial and human resources restricted us in using a population-based design, which is considered as the gold standard in evaluating disease epidemics.12 The choice of blood donors as population samples may result in potential bias, such as selection bias for age coverage and self-identified health conditions. Second, the syphilis seroprevalence among first-time donors was significantly higher than that among repeat donors.12 15 This study did not collect the information of first-time donors and repeat donors, which may lead to underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. Third, false-negative results attributable to the window period of syphilis infection may result in an underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. However, the residual risk of syphilis infection is very low according to a residual risk analysis conducted in Shenzhen.37\n",
