Italy, Iran, Korea, Japan, the United States, and other countries have reported\nnearly 60 000 cases. Most COVID-19 patients initially suffered from fever, cough,\nfatigue, and shortness of breath, while other symptoms included muscle pain, headache,\nchest pain, and diarrhea, similar to the symptoms observed after chemotherapy, targeted\nand immune therapy.1 In addition, cancer itself along with its treatment makes cancer patients more\nsusceptible to pneumonias, due to weakened immune response to respiratory bacteria and\nvirus. Thus, the epidemic spread of COVID-19 has posed great challenges to the clinical\npractice of oncologists, especially for integrative cancer therapy.",

Integrative cancer therapies such as\nacupuncture and massage involve close contact with cancer patients, and are widely used\nto relieve and control a variety of symptoms in cancer patients. We suggest that\nintegrative cancer therapies involving close contact with cancer patients should be\nrigidly considered or forbidden in endemic areas, and stronger personal protection\nprovisions should be made for patients with cancer and integrative cancer therapists. In\nhigh epidemic areas, members of the public are encouraged to reduce going out; thus, Tai\nChi and Qi Gong, as integrative therapies, might be very suitable indoor exercises to\nstrengthen the constitution.",

In comparison, one integrative therapy, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), is\nwidely used in the treatment of COVID-19, and was shown to be quite effective in\npreliminary clinical practice. China\u2019s National Health Commission issued a Diagnosis and\nTreatment Protocol for COVID-19, providing a systemic treatment with CHM.3 Thus, cancer patients diagnosed with mild or medium COVID-19 should be encouraged\nto receive CHM therapies. In addition, we should strengthen monitoring and give priority\nto the patients infected with COVID-19 with cancer during CHM treatment, especially the\nelderly and those with complications.",
