These samples were submitted by\nveterinary clinics in Japan (Aomori, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo, Kochi and\nOkinawa). Viral RNA was extracted from rectal swabs using the High Pure Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel,\nSwitzerland) following the attached instructions. cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers as shown in\nTable 1. PCR was performed using the method of Takano et al. [13]. ELIF-ELIR used to detect CCoV-I also detects FCoV-I. Thus, the ORF3f-ORF3r primer set\nwhich specifically detects only CCoV-I was also used. The CCoV gene was detected in rectal swab samples collected\nfrom dogs. CCoV N gene was detected in 27/101 (26.7%). CCoV-I S gene, CCoV-II S gene and CCoV-I specific ORF3 gene\nwere detected in 21/101 (20.8%), 2/101 (2.0%) and 24/101 (23.8%), respectively. On the basis of the rate of CCoV N\ngene- and ORF3 gene-positive CCoV-infected dogs, the type of CCoV detected in samples from CCoV-infected dogs was\nCCoV-I in 88.9%. The CCoV-I S gene fragments (PCR products generated using ELIF-ELIR) were sequenced as described\nby Takano et al. [15]. Amino acid sequences were deduced\nfrom the CCoV-I S gene detected in 4 dogs with diarrhea symptoms (Nos.9, 19, 27 and 33) and 2 dogs without\ndiarrhea symptoms (Nos. 55 and 73) (Fig. 1A). All of 6 CCoV strains detected in this study were classified into the clade of the other CCoV-I (Fig. 1B).",

When the relationship between CCoV infection and the manifestation\nof diarrhea symptoms was investigated using the \u03c72 test, a correlation was noted (df=1,\n\u03c72=8.90, P<0.005). Similar results were obtained when the prevalence of CCoV-I\ninfection was analyzed (Table 2, CCoV-I S and CCoV ORF3). Soma\net al.

There was no correlation between CCoV infection and the age, sex or breed of dogs, but when the\ndogs were limited to those with diarrhea symptoms, the infection rate was higher in dogs younger than one year\nold, as reported by Soma et al. [12]. Based on this\nfinding, CCoV-infected dogs younger than one year old are likely to develop diarrhea, whereas one-year-old or\nolder dogs are unlikely to develop diarrhea, although they are infected with CCoV. However, the relationship\nbetween the age and CCoV infection in dogs should be comprehensively judged based on the presence or absence of\nmixed infection with other pathogens, the host\u2019s immune condition and environment in which dogs are\nmaintained.",

Thus, using canine sera collected between 1998 and 2006, the presence\nof anti-CCoV-I antibody earlier than 2007 was investigated employing the neutralizing antibody test. However, in\nthe absence of CCoV-I laboratory strain, we used FCoV-I that shares high sequence homology in the S protein with\nCCoV-I. Neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibodies were detected in serum samples from dogs in Japan. It was assumed that\nthe neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibody-positive dogs had been: i) infected with CCoV-I showing high-level genetic\nhomology with FCoV-I or ii) infected with FCoV-I. It is also strongly suggested that CCoV-I-infected dogs and\nFCoV-I-infected dogs were mixed in the dogs from which sera were collected. However, regarding ii), to our\nknowledge, infection of a dog with FCoV has not been reported. In any case, it was clarified that 77.7% of dogs in\nJapan possess antibodies against FCoV-I and/or CCoV-I. It is suggested that FCoV-I and/or CCoV-I are widely\nprevalent in dogs in Japan since 1998. To closely investigate CCoV-I or FCoV-I infection in dogs, it is necessary\nto perform similar tests using both CCoV-I and FCoV-I. However, no assay detecting only anti-CCoV-I antibodies is\navailable. Development of a method to detect anti-CCoV-I antibodies is desired.",
