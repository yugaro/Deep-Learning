The demyelination is progressive over time; however, spontaneous, but transient, myelin repair can occur during the course of the disease. Endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are believed to be responsible for spontaneous remyelination (Lassmann et al., 1997), but it is unclear why these cells only act intermittently. An important unmet clinical need for MS patients is an effective method to induce sustained remyelination.",

Studies in animal models have demonstrated the benefits of cell therapy in treating mouse models of MS. For example, myelin generation (Buchet et al., 2011), accompanied by modulation of inflammatory responses, followed CNS transplantation of human neural precursor cells into animal models in which myelin formation is defective or demyelination is induced via immunization with encephalitogenic peptides. Another model, which we employed in this study, is based on findings that persistent infection with a mouse neurotropic coronavirus correlates with chronic neuroinflammation and immune-mediated demyelination (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997).",

We observed clinical recovery associated with muted neuroinflammation and decreased demyelination, along with emergence of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Ablation of Tregs in hNPC-transplanted mice inhibited the improvement in motor skills and increased neuroinflammation and in vitro, hNPCs modulated cytokine secretion and proliferation by antigen-sensitized T cells. Interestingly, the hNPCs were rapidly rejected after transplantation into these immunocompetent mice, indicating that the sustained neurologic recovery was not dependent on stable engraftment of hNPCs.",

Because there is considerable phenotypic diversity among preparations of neural precursor cells (M\u00fcller et al., 2008), we performed extensive microarray-based transcriptome analysis to define a genomic phenotype for the cells that showed clinical activity. The microarray analysis revealed a consistent profile of gene expression among separate populations of hNPCs differentiated by our method (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online).",

To track the fate of the cells following injection, we transplanted hNPCs constitutively expressing the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene and monitored their presence by daily luciferin injection and IVIS imaging. Luciferase signals within the spinal cord were highest at day 1 pt and declined below the level of detection by day 8 pt. (Figure 1E). Imaging of transplanted cells revealed that the hNPCs did not migrate extensively within the spinal cord and did not disseminate into peripheral tissues. To confirm the imaging data, spinal cords from hNPC-transplanted mice were removed at defined times pt, serially sectioned 5 mm rostral and 5 mm caudal to the injection site, and immunostained for a human-specific cytoplasmic antigen (Uchida et al., 2012). As shown in Figure 1F, hNPCs were detected at days 1 and 4 pt, but staining was very weak by day 7 pt. These findings confirm that transplanted hNPCs survived for approximately 1 week after transplantation.",

Analysis of spinal cords from hNPC-transplanted mice at 21 days pt revealed a marked reduction in inflammatory cells present within spinal cords compared to the controls. Clinical recovery following hNPC transplantation is associated with reduced neuroinflammation in the spinal cord (Figure 2A). Immunostaining for activated macrophage/microglia and T cells (Figures 2B and 2C), critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination in JHMV-infected mice, revealed an overall reduction in immunoreactive cells within the spinal cords that was sustained past 175 days pt. (data not shown). Quantification of macrophage/microglia and T cell immunostaining indicated that hNPC transplantation resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in both cell populations compared to control mice (Figure 2D). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed immunostaining by showing reduced infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the CNS of hNPC-treated mice compared to controls (Figures 3A and 3B). Accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CNS of hNPC-treated mice was also determined by tetramer staining (Zhao et al., 2011). Infiltration of CD4+ T cells recognizing the immunodominant epitope within the viral matrix (M) glycoprotein spanning amino acids 133\u2013147 (M133\u2013147) and CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope in the spike glycoprotein located on amino acids 510\u2013518 (S510\u2013518) were both reduced in hNPC-transplanted mice (Figures 3A and 3B). In addition, macrophage (F4/80+CD45high) infiltration was reduced in hNPC-transplanted mice (Figure 3C). Analysis of viral titers within the CNS of experimental mice indicated that control of viral replication within the spinal cords was not affected by hNPC transplantation; replicating virus was not detected (Figure 3D), and there were no differences in transcript levels of viral RNA (Figure 3E).",

Flow analysis of dissociated cells from spinal cords revealed an increased frequency of Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) in the spinal cords of hNPC-transplanted mice at day 10 pt (Figures 5A and 5B). In order to clarify the role of Tregs in improved clinical recovery, hNPCs transplanted mice were treated at days \u22122, 0, and +2 pt with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, which efficiently blocks Treg activity (Kohm et al., 2006). Flow analysis of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells within draining cervical lymph nodes of anti-CD25-treated mice at day 9 pt confirmed efficient depletion of Tregs (>95%) (data not shown). This treatment inhibited functional improvement in hNPC-transplanted mice out to day 20 pt (Figure 5C).

Stimulation of T cells isolated from hNPC-transplanted mice with virus-specific CD4+ peptide resulted in reduced (p < 0.05) expression of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was elevated (p < 0.001) compared to control mice (Figure 6A). We determined whether the hNPC-induced protective effect was mediated by suppression of virus-specific T cell proliferation, as this could contribute to clinical recovery. Coculture of hNPCs with splenocytes obtained from JHMV-immunized mice and pulsed with the CD4+ T-cell-specific immunodominant epitope M133\u2013147 peptide resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of proliferation of CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B) that was associated with an increased frequency of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells (Figure 6C). Further characterization revealed that proliferation of virus-specific M133\u2013147 CD4+ T cells (Figure 6D), but not virus-specific S510\u2013518 CD8+ T cells (Figure 6E), was lower (p < 0.001) when compared to control cultures in which hNPCs were not included.",

This suggests that transplanted hNPCs may secrete factors that have long-term effects on neuroinflammation and demyelination. Recent studies have shown that certain hNPCs secrete the immunomodulatory cytokines TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 and there is an increase in the frequency of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells following coculture of hNPCs with human PBMCs (Liu et al., 2013). Our microarray gene expression analysis identified TGF-\u03b22 among the genes that were consistently more highly expressed in hNPCs compared to other cell types (Table S1). We used qRT-PCR to compare transcript levels in hESCs and hNPCs and found that the TGF-\u03b2 family of cytokines was differentially expressed (p < 1 \u00d7 10\u22126) in the hNPCs (Figure 7A). TGF-\u03b22 transcripts were 250-fold higher in hNPCs, whereas TGF-\u03b21 transcripts were \u223c5-fold higher compared to hESCs (Figure 7A). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was previously shown to be associated with mesenchymal stem cell-mediated recovery in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model (Bai et al., 2012), but our results showed that HGF transcripts were nearly undetectable in our hNPCs (Figure 7A). Consistent with the transcript analysis, measurement of protein levels in culture medium conditioned by hNPCs showed that there was an approximate 40-fold higher level of TGF-\u03b22 and a 3-fold higher level of TGF-\u03b21 in hNPC-conditioned medium (CM) compared to control medium (Figure 7B). Inclusion of neutralizing antibodies specific for TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22 blocked the ability of hNPCs to inhibit proliferation of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, and inclusion of both antibodies had the largest effect (Figure 7C). In addition, antibody targeting of TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22, alone or in combination, reduced numbers of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells emerging in cocultures of hNPCs and T cells (Figure 7D), suggesting an important role for these cytokines in contributing to the immunomodulatory effects of hNPCs.",

A recent study (Bai et al., 2012) reported that mesenchymal stem-cell-induced recovery in the EAE mouse model and in lysolecithin-induced demyelination was dependent upon release of HGF. Although we have found that our hNPCs do not produce detectable HGF mRNA or protein, our findings are similar with regard to immunomodulation, diminished spread of demyelination, and remyelination. Additional studies also support the immunomodulatory properties associated with transplanted stem cells; in one study, intracerebroventricularly injected human glial cells rapidly died yet resulted in reduction of the clinical severity of EAE that correlated with inhibited proliferation of myelin-specific T cells (Kim et al., 2012b). Similarly, human ESC-derived oligodendrocyte precursors did not survive past 8 days following intraventricular injection into mice with EAE, yet animals displayed decreased neurologic disability, and this was associated with increased numbers of regulatory T cells within the CNS (Kim et al., 2012a). These reports are consistent with growing evidence that transplanted stem cells rarely differentiate into cells of neural lineage, and their efficacy often appears to be through delivery of trophic factors (Blurton-Jones et al., 2009; M\u00fcller et al., 2006) or by modulating inflammation (Neirinckx et al., 2013).",

            "text": "An important question that remains an area of ongoing work is to determine whether the sustained presence of Tregs after hNPC rejection continues to dampen neuroinflammation long term. We believe this is possible because hNPCs had already disappeared from the spinal cord at the time we detected increased numbers of Tregs. Our results suggest that Tregs are a critical component of the recovery, because antibody-mediated ablation of Tregs reduced the clinical effects of hNPCs. We are interested in characterizing cytokine profiles within both the CNS and draining cervical lymph nodes, as recent studies argue that Treg-mediated effects in controlling neuroinflammation and demyelination in JHMV-infected mice occurs in lymphatic tissue (Trandem et al., 2010) and that certain cytokines can function in controlling Treg suppression (Zhao et al., 2011). As it is unlikely that transplanted hNPCs were differentiating into oligodendroglia, it appears that remyelination is occurring in response to activation of endogenous OPCs through mechanisms that remain to be defined. One possible mechanism is that the transplanted cells or Tregs, or both, may secrete factors that influence maturation of OPCs.",

            "text": "Our studies suggest that direct delivery of precursor cells into the CNS via intraspinal transplantation influences clinical and histologic outcome through interactions of transplanted cells with inflammatory cells present within the CNS microenvironment, such as by affecting the emergence of Tregs. This suggests that transplanted hNPCs can manipulate the microenvironment, presumably through localized secretion of soluble factors that modulate the immune response and remyelination. Our work and the work of others (Liu et al., 2013) shows that cultured hNPCs secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22. Based on our experiments and previous reports, our current hypothesis is that the emergence of Tregs in the areas of the transplant may be due to localized expression of TGF-\u03b21 and/or TGF-\u03b22 following hNPC transplantation. The immunodulatory effects of TGF-\u03b2 in regulating immune tolerance and T cell homeostasis are well documented (Sakaguchi, 2004), and our findings indicate an important role for TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 in contributing to the hNPC-mediated inhibition of proliferation of antigen-specific T cells and in increasing the frequency of regulatory T cells. This evidence supports the idea that the presence of transplanted hNPCs suppresses the proliferation of virus-specific T cells, reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, while enhancing the increase in T regulatory cells that coincides with clinical recovery.",

A heatmap shows the hierarchical clustering of 118 probes that were significantly differentially expressed (p < 0.001) in hNPCs. Five independent cultures of hNPCs were compared by global gene expression analysis (Human HT-12 v. 4 Expression Beadchip), with four samples of human pluripotent stem cells (two hESC and two iPSC lines) and a sample of human fibroblasts. The scale at right indicates the fold differences in gene expression, with yellow indicating relatively higher expression and blue indicating relatively lower expression.
