Since the structure of RNA is evolutionarily more conserved than its sequence, predicting the RNA's; secondary structure is one of the most important steps towards its functional analysis. There are two fundamentally different approaches to predicting RNA secondary structures, namely free-energy minimization and probabilistic approaches, which often use phylogenetic information given by a multiple sequence alignment. This duality of approaches represents two different types of RNA structure information, the former relies on the physical properties of single sequences, while the latter uses evolutionary information in the form of compensatory base pair substitutions.",

On the other hand, it is known that methods such as RNAfold (1) and Mfold (2) achieve an overall sensitivity of about 70% (3). For example, H/ACA snoRNAs usually do not produce the characteristic two-stem when the energy minimization alone is used to determine the structure. Instead, information on the functional sites have to be used as additional constraints to the thermodynamic folding (4\u20136). In general, there are several reasons for the inaccuracy of energy minimization. First, the energy model is incomplete, especially for multi-loop structures. Second, there can be alternative structures with similar free energies. And third, true structures are often stabilized by bound molecules. The only feasible way to determine the effects of these inaccuracies is to include phylogenetic information by looking for conserved substructures that cannot be accounted for by thermodynamic folding alone.",

This was probably addressed for the first time in 1985 by David Sankoff (7), who introduced an algorithm that solved the problem of simultaneously aligning and folding a set of unaligned RNA sequences. While, this is a kind of gold standard for comparative RNA secondary structure prediction, the \u2018algorithm requires extreme amounts of memory and time\u2019 (8). Thus, practical implementations of the Sankoff algorithm like FOLDALIGN (9\u201312), Dynalign (13,14), PMcomp (15), LocARNA (16,17) and PARTS (18), published more than 20 years later, introduce different constraints and somewhat arbitrary choices in their scoring schemes to make the approach tractable for realistic input sizes.",

Unlike the aforementioned Sankoff-like methods where the energy is explicitly reflected in the scoring scheme, these approaches rely purely on statistical learning methods to determine their parameters. A mixed approach is employed by CMfinder (21) that implicitly combines energy contributions with an SCFG. As a seed CMfinder uses energetically folded structures from which a covariance model (SCFG) is constructed in successive rounds of optimization. Another approach is SimulFold (22), which simultaneously infers structures (including pseudoknots), alignments and trees. There are no sequence-dependent energy contributions, but an energy term that depends on the topology of the consensus structure.",

This approach has proven useful in genomic screens for ncRNAs (23,24), despite their limitations in finding RNA structures in more divergent sequences (25). It has been shown that the quality of the predictions breaks down in cases where sequence identity is <60% (26). On the other hand, these methods can also be applied to improve the consensus structure prediction in Sankoff-like approaches. The reason is simply that the Sankoff-like approaches usually apply a progressive strategy by combining pairwise alignments to build the final multiple alignment. Thus, consensus structure prediction can be improved when considering the complete phylogenetic information.",

And second, the structure prediction would be based on a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Recent work by Carvalho and Lawrence (29) has shown that this approach often does not yield to the desired result. Basically, the implicit assumption of a maximum likelihood or MAP approach is that the structure with the highest probability is also the structure where the ensemble of close neighbors has the highest probability mass, which is often not the case. Hence, Carvalho and Lawrence proposed different new classes of estimators, which included estimators already used in sequence alignment and RNA secondary structure prediction. One example is the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) method originally introduced by ref. (30) and successfully applied to sequence alignment in ProbCons (31) and to RNA structure prediction in CONTRAfold (3). A partition function version of the Sankoff algorithm (which is related to MEA scoring) was introduced in ref. (32). Another example is Pfold itself, since the current implementation does not use the maximum likelihood approach originally introduced in ref. (33), but is based on reliability scores (27), which can be interpreted as a variant of MEA scoring.",
