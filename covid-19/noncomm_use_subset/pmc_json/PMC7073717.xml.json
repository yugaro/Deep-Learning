There is much more to known about this new infection: what is the transmission ability of asymptomatic carriers? What is the proportion of infected cases missed at the tracing and control procedures? Are the current strategies to prevent the spreading of the infection effective? Global efforts are, therefore, needed to address all these questions.",
