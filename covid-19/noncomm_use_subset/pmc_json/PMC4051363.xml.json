Over 100 human enterovirus serotypes have been identified based on antibody neutralization tests, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16), the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which has emerged as an important public health problem in recent years, especially in Asia and Pacific regions. EV71 and CA16 usually infect infants and children under seven years old and present with a papulovesicular rash.1 A few children suffer complications such as myocarditis, pulmonary edema and aseptic meningoencephalitis, which can be fatal. Occasionally, HFMD is observed in adults.2,3",

In China, HFMD is primarily associated with EV71, which caused the outbreaks of HFMD in Anhui province in 2008, in Guangdong province in 2009 and in Jiangsu province in 2012.4,5,6 However, in other countries, HFMD is mostly associated with CA16.7 The seroprevalence trends of these two viruses are changing over time. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Although immunoglobulins and the antiviral agent ribavirin are commonly used, their efficacy remains uncertain.8 Thus, the development of effective vaccines to prevent HFMD is critical. Knowing the seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 is necessary to generate a suitable and effective vaccine. The seroprevalence of EV71 and CA16 has been investigated in children and pregnant women,6,9,10,11 but little is known about the seroprevalence of these viruses in healthy adults, despite the fact that adults do suffer from HFMD and can present with serious symptoms.2,3 However, efforts to investigate the seroprevalence of these viruses in adults are increasing and may reflect the continued spread of these viruses.",

Both enterovirus and adenovirus are transmitted via the respiratory or fecal\u2013oral routes, and both can be neurotoxic. These two viruses can be shed for a prolonged period after infection in humans, so they can reach similar co-infection rates.13 During an HFMD outbreak in Sarawak in 1997, a subgroup B adenovirus and an enterovirus were isolated from three fatal cases, supporting the concept of co-infection with these viruses in humans.14",

AdHu5 is a subgroup C adenovirus and is one of the most common adenoviruses circulating in both children and adults. AdC7 originated in chimpanzees and is thought to be a rare serotype in humans, although little is known about its prevalence in the human population. Chimpanzee adenoviruses have been considered ideal carriers for the development of vaccines against a broad range of pathogens because their neutralizing antibodies are rare in humans, and this low antibody prevalence would circumvent the negative effects of pre-existing immunity to common human serotypes of adenovirus.17,18 Evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to AdC7, compared with AdHu5, may provide evidence supporting the potential use of AdC7 as an additional or alternative vaccine carrier.",

We found AdHu5 seroprevalence to be significantly higher in coastal regions than in inland regions, which could be due to the mild and humid climate in coastal areas; it is possible that the coastal climate contributes to the spread of adenovirus infections.

AdC7 represents a distinct serotype related to human adenovirus and has already been used as a vaccine carrier in many studies, with promising results.40,41,42 However, the seroprevalence status of AdC7 in humans has not been investigated extensively. In our study, we showed that the AdC7 seropositivity rate in adults is low (11.8%) and similar to that for AdC68 (12.7%) in Chinese adults,22 and that the AdC7 seroprevalence rate does not vary significantly among regions, genders or age groups. Like AdC7, AdC68 is another rare serotype, related to human adenovirus, from chimpanzees.17 The neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5, which implies these three viruses cocirculate in adults and that adenovirus infection also should be taken into consideration in the prevention and treatment of HFMD.",
