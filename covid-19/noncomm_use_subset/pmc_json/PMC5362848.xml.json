Concerning the available therapeutics for FeL, this cat was first treated with allopurinol, which was insufficient despite its use being common in the treatment of canine leishmaniosis. Even though the use of allopurinol is off-label in both dogs and cats, there is a more extensive clinical experience of efficacy and safety in dogs. Under the scope of \u2018cascade\u2019 a combined therapeutic not yet approved for cats was suggested to the owner.",
