            "text": "The genome size of RNA viruses is highly variable, ranging from less than 4 kb for members of the Narnaviridae to more than 30 kb for some Coronaviridae. However, most RNA viruses have genome sizes in the 5\u201315-kb range (Holmes 2009). What could explain this wide range of genome sizes in RNA viruses? Small genomes probably replicate faster than large ones, while genome size limits enzymatic complexity. This limited complexity results in lower-fidelity replication enzymes, which in turn leads to higher variability (Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry 1995). On the other hand, larger genomes will replicate more slowly, while being less constrained in the complexity of the proteins they code for. Therefore, larger genomes allow for evolutionary innovations such as polymerases with greater replication fidelity (Denison et al. 2011) or the modulation of host immune responses (Shackelton and Holmes 2004). However, the evolution of larger genomes and greater complexity may be impeded by Eigen\u2019s paradox: to obtain proofreading activity, an RNA virus must already have a large genome (Eigen 1971; Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry 1995). It has therefore been suggested that RNA virus genome size evolves to the upper limit imposed by mutation rate (Swetina and Schuster 1982).",

            "text": "If genome size of RNA viruses is limited by a tradeoff between RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) fidelity and decreased replication rates, then examples of enlargement in genome size should be scarce for RNA viruses. There are, however, some examples of the integration of host genetic material into viral RNA genomes, leading to the largest known RNA viruses. For instance, the genome of coronaviruses contains homologous sequences of at least five cellular enzymes that are associated with RNA processing and that may be involved in modulating mutation rate (Snijder et al. 2003). Acquisition of a host\u2019s ubiquitin gene by certain strains of bovine viral diarrhoea pestivirus resulted in increased pathogenicity (Meyers et al. 1989). Plant closterovirus genomes encode for a homologue of cellular molecular chaperone HSP70 (Dolja et al. 2006) that is required for virion assembly (Satyanarayana et al. 2000). Finally, a particularly interesting case is the ubiquitous presence of DNA/RNA repair AlkB-like proteins in several groups of plant viruses, including closterovirus, flexivirus, tymovirus, and even one potyvirus (Blackberry virus Y; Susaimuthu et al. 2008), whose function has been postulated to be both repair of nucleic acid alkylation and suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing (Aravind and Koonin 2001; Bratlie and Drabl\u00f8s 2005). Similarly, the insertion of sequences into a viral genome generally leads to their rapid removal, as has been seen in the case of heterologous genes (Chapman et al. 1992; Guo et al. 1998; Chung et al 2007; Paar et al. 2007; Zwart et al 2014) and repetitions of endogenous noncoding sequences (Nagai et al. 2003; Gritsun and Gould 2006). Finally, most viruses have a tendency to evolve defective interfering viruses under conditions promoting cellular coinfection (Huang 1973; Roux et al. 1991), again suggesting a link between genome size and replication. Although demographic conditions may allow for the maintenance of extraneous sequences (Dolja et al. 1993; Zwart et al. 2014), overall it appears as if genome size is limited and under purifying selection, and that the incorporation or maintenance of foreign sequences comes at a cost to viruses (Sakai et al. 1999; Marks et al. 2005; Holmes 2009; Zwart et al. 2014).",

            "text": "On the other hand, genome size does not appear to be under the same selective pressure in eukaryotes, probably due to the smaller effective population sizes in higher organisms (Lynch et al. 2006). Although the existence of many retroviral sequences in eukaryotic genomes was already well documented (Gifford and Tristem 2003), it has been recently found that there are also many nonretroviral RNA virus genes in eukaryotic genomes. These nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) have been found in mammals (Geuking et al. 2009; Belyi et al. 2010; Horie et al. 2010; Katzourakis and Gifford 2010), plants (Hong et al. 1998; Chiba et al. 2011), and fungi (Taylor and Bruenn 2009). In fungi, NIRVs are very common and have in some cases become functional genes (Koonin 2010). In one case, the entire viral RdRp was integrated and conserved, probably conferring viral resistance to the host (Taylor and Bruenn 2009). It has also been suggested that NIRVs can confer resistance (Bertsch et al. 2009) or tolerance (Flegel 2009) against the original virus to plant or animal hosts. Indeed, it has been a common practice to generate commercial transgenic plants resistant to viruses by inserting full or partial viral genes into the genome of the plants of agronomic interest (reviewed in Kundu and Mandal [2001]); these transgenic plants can be considered as artificial cases of NIRVs.",

In practice, this will depend on their location in the genome and the state of the host cell. Some NIRVs are, however, clearly expressed by the host (Taylor and Bruenn 2009). Host NIRV expression has been proposed to mediate host immunity against the cognate virus (Bertsch et al. 2009; Flegel 2009; Taylor and Bruenn 2009). However, host NIRV expression may also have important implications for the evolution of the cognate virus. The absence of an effective NIRV-induced host immune response and sufficiently high NIRV expression levels could lead to complementation of host proteins, making the NIRV-expressed genes in the cognate virus functionally redundant. What would be the impact of NIRV expression on viral replication? Is there any selective advantage to using in trans the protein produced from the NIRV as a functional viral protein? How will a virus population evolve in such a situation of functional redundancy? Finally, how do such large-scale genomic perturbations affect the regulation of expression and accumulation of all other viral components? To our knowledge these questions have not been addressed in any study, while given the prevalence of NIRVs in natural host populations and biosafety issues linked to the use of transgenic plants expressing viral genes for resistance, it is a highly relevant topic.",

This system is an experimental model for exploring what the effects of high levels of NIRV expression are on virus infection and evolution. During infection of these transgenic plants, plant-derived NIb expression makes virus-derived NIb-expression redundant (Li and Carrington 1995). We therefore expect that there may be relaxed selection for maintenance of the NIb cistron in the viral genome, which might lead to selection of variants with genomic deletions at the NIb locus, due to the replicative advantage associated with a smaller genome size. Ultimately, the expression of NIb might therefore induce genome shrinkage and result in a virus population that can no longer autonomously infect wild-type plants. We first determined whether the deletion of viral NIb led to an increase in viral fitness in NIb-expressing plants. Then, we passaged a full-length wild-type virus in NIb-expressing plants and used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to check for deletions in TEV NIb locus. Finally, we preempted the complete deletion of TEV NIb in NIb-expressing plants and studied the effects of NIb complementation in trans on genomic changes.",

Nicotiana tabacum 35S::NIb plants were inoculated with a 1:1 mixture of homogenates of both viruses. Twenty plants were inoculated by abrasion of the third true leaf with 30 \u03bcl mixed homogenate, and 20 plants were taken as a mock-inoculated control. After 7, 21, and 63 dpi, total RNA was extracted from the youngest leaves of five plants. The region flanking the NIb cistron was reverse transcribed using Moloney Murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (RT) (Fermentas) and primer 97-101-R (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). PCR amplification was performed using the high-fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and the 73-80-F/92-96-R primers (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel to verify the presence of both genotypes. RT-qPCR was performed to compare viral accumulation in case of direct competition between the two genotypes. RT-qPCR for the CP cistron was used to determine the total level of viral accumulation (i.e., accumulation of both genotypes), using the specific primers TEV-CP-qPCR-F and TEV-CP-qPCR-R (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). RT-qPCRs were performed using One-Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR kit II (Takara) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. CP was chosen because it locates in the 3\u2032 end of TEV genome and hence would only quantify complete genomes but not partial incomplete amplicons. Each RNA sample was quantified three times in independent experiments. Amplifications were done using the ABI PRISM Sequence Analyzer 7000 (Applied Biosystems). The thermal profile was as follows: RT phase consisted of 5 min at 42 \u00b0C followed by 10 s at 95 \u00b0C; and PCR phase of 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 \u00b0C and 31 s at 60 \u00b0C. Quantification results were examined using SDS7000 software v. 1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR for NIaPro/NIb cistrons was then performed to determine viral accumulation of the TEV genotype only, using specific primers TEV-NIaPro/NIb-F and TEV-NIaPro/NIb-R (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) and otherwise identical conditions when compared with the quantification of the CP. The ratio of TEV-\u0394NIb to TEV (R) is then R = (nCP\u2212nNIaPro/NIb)/nNIaPro/NIb, where nCP and nNIaPro/NIb are the copy numbers of the CP and NIaPro/NIb, respectively, as measured by RT-qPCR. To estimate the replicative advantage W (Carrasco et al. 2007) of TEV-\u0394NIb, we performed linear regression on the infection time in days and the log-transformed ratio data. The antilog-transformed slope is W.",

Xanthi plants expressing TEV NIb under control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter, referred to here as N. tabacum 35S::NIb. TEV variants with disruption of the polymerase GDD amino acid motif, the nuclear localization signal, or the NIb N-terminal cleavage site could replicate in these transgenic plants, whereas replication was not supported in wild-type plants. Moreover, a TEV variant missing NIb altogether could also infect these transgenic plants and induce symptoms after 7 dpi, similar to the wild-type virus. Tromas and Elena (2010) also generated a TEV variant missing the NIb cistron, referred to here as TEV-\u0394NIb. TEV-\u0394NIb can infect N. tabacum 35S::NIb, but not the wild-type N. tabacum, in agreement with previous results (Li and Carrington 1995). TEV is the full-length wild-type virus, capable of infecting both wild-type N. tabacum and 35S::NIb transgenic plants. When wild-type N. tabacum plants were coinoculated with different mixtures of TEV:TEV-\u0394NIb (1:100 to 100:1), we detected only infection by TEV. Coinfected wild-type plants were probably not observed because the low cellular multiplicity of infection of TEV in N. tabacum (Tromas et al. 2014) precludes cellular coinfection, especially early in infection.",

If 1) a relationship between genome size and virus replication exists (Sakai et al. 1999; Zwart et al. 2014) and 2) dependence on in trans NIb expression for replication does not impose a large fitness burden to the virus, then NIb deletion in the virus genome will cause a faster replication and a selective advantage over a full-length wild-type virus. We therefore inoculated 15 N. tabacum 35S::NIb plants with a 1:1 mixture of ground infectious tissue with TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb and measured the ratio of the two variants at 7, 21, and 63 dpi using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Five plants were analyzed for each time point, meaning that each data point represents an independent measurement. On the basis of these data, we estimated the selective advantage for TEV as the per day selection rate constant W (Materials and Methods). A significant, upward-sloping linear regression was observed between time and the ratio of the TEV-\u0394NIb:TEV (fig. 1; r2 = 0.632, F1,14 = 22.330, P < 0.001), meaning that the ratio of the viruses shifts significantly toward TEV-\u0394NIb, and this virus therefore has a significantly higher competitive fitness. We estimated that W = 1.028 \u00b1 0.006 d\u22121 (\u00b11 SD), suggesting that TEV-\u0394NIb will slowly displace the wild-type virus in transgenic plants. If genome size was inversely proportional to fitness and the 16% reduction in genome size were the only determinant of fitness for TEV-\u0394NIb, we would expect W = 1/(1\u20130.16) = 1.19 d\u22121. The 95% confidence interval for our estimate of W is 1.016\u20131.040 d\u22121, suggesting that 1) there is a cost to depend on in trans NIb expression, but 2) this cost is partially compensated for by faster replication of TEV-\u0394NIb, resulting in a higher W than the wild-type virus. Our data therefore support the idea of a relationship between genome size and fitness, and suggest that viruses harboring deletions in NIb will outcompete the wild-type virus in NIb-expressing plants. Therefore, NIRV expression might also lead to conditions favoring the replication of virus variants, with deletions in the gene(s) encoded for by the NIRV. However, the accumulation of viruses with large genomic deletions due to in trans expression of virus\u2019 genes will also depend on mutational supply, specifically how often recombination generates viruses with deletions in NIb that conserve the reading frame in downstream genes.\n",

In sharp contrast, several authors have failed to detect recombination events between transgenes and potyviruses (Chung et al. 2007; Dietrich et al. 2007). To test for possible recombination events in our system, we performed an evolution experiment consisting of five independent lineages of TEV-\u0394NIb serially passaged four times in N. tabacum 35S::NIb transgenic plants, with each passage being 3 weeks long. At the end of the evolution experiment, we analyzed the evolved lineages by RT-PCR using a combination of primers that will specifically amplify full-genome viruses (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). We found no evidence for recombination between TEV-\u0394NIb and host-derived NIb transcripts. Therefore, we conclude that, in our experimental set up, regeneration of the wild-type genome by recombination is an unlikely phenomenon. This outcome is congruent with the estimates of within-host fitness for TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb; recombinants analogous to the wild-type virus would be displaced by TEV-\u0394NIb, and the process could occur rapidly as de novo variation will initially be present at low frequencies in the virus population. On the other hand, this result may reflect the possibility that recombination between TEV-\u0394NIb and the transgene transcripts is very rare, as shown for other potyviruses (Chung et al. 2007; Dietrich et al. 2007).",

A TEV genome region encompassing the NIaPro, NIb, and CP cistrons (positions 6377\u20139473 of the wild-type genome) was amplified and sequenced (Materials and Methods). We developed a new approach for identifying deletions, adapting GSNAP (Wu and Nacu 2010) to detect deletions instead of introns (Materials and Methods). As a negative control, the same region was analyzed using NGS data for five lineages of TEV-eGFP evolved for three 9-week passages in wild-type N. tabacum plants (Zwart et al. 2014). No deletions were detected in the entire region, suggesting that our NGS analysis does not generate artifacts. The frequencies of deletion variants (see supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) in systemically infected leaves of transgenic plants were significantly higher than the frequencies found in our negative controls (Fisher\u2019s exact test, P < 0.001). The NGS results were consistent with RT-PCR data; the deletion variant detected by RT-PCR in Lineage 2 (positions 7621\u20138484) and Lineage 3 (positions 7046\u20138500) was the variant found at the highest frequency by NGS, 0.249 and 0.246, respectively.

The 43.75% of genotypes carrying deletions larger than the NIb cistron will produce viruses with truncated cistrons NIaPro, CP, or both. Moreover, deletions beyond the NIb cistron will lead to the loss of proteolytic cleavage sites and result in fusion of the truncated proteins. These genomes will probably be defective particles and some may additionally interfere with replication of the full-length virus. These defective particles can only replicate if they are complemented by a full-length TEV or possibly other defective genomes, and their spread may therefore be limited. The highest frequency of putatively defective deletion variants does not exceed 1%, in line with our expectations: two NIaPro-to-CP deletion variants (positions 6569\u20138746 and 6774\u20138795; Lineage 1) show frequencies of 1.88 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.58 \u00d7 10\u22123, respectively.

This clustering is consistent with the idea that we are more likely to detect deletion variants that only affect part of NIb and are, therefore, likely viable by complementation in trans.",

In two lineages, these variants reached high frequencies, comprising approximately a fourth of the population. These results are therefore a proof of principle that NIRV expression could have a similar effect on a virus population: allowing deletion mutants to be maintained in the virus populations, while also providing conditions in which these mutants could reach high frequencies. The immediate effect of these deletions will be that a part of the virus population is replication defective in host individuals that do not express the NIRV. This could have important ramifications for viral spread, and virus\u2013host coevolution. On the other hand, the further evolution of a virus population in a host expressing virus genes may also be contingent upon the presence of genomic deletions in the viral genome.",

How would these deletion mutants further evolve in transgenic plants, and would their evolution be different from that of a full-length TEV? To address this question and gain insight into the long-term evolution of viruses harboring NIRV-induced deletions, we performed a second evolution experiment for both TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb passaged in N. tabacum 35S::NIb, with five independent lineages for each virus.\nLi and Carrington (1995) showed that beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in leaves systemically infected by the TEV-\u0394NIb-GUS mutant was comparable to that of the parental TEV-GUS. We found a similar result for the accumulation of TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb in N. tabacum 35S::NIb using RT-qPCR (fig. 3A): there was not a significant difference in virus accumulation at 7 dpi (t8 = 1.394, P = 0.201). The infection dynamics of the two viruses should therefore be similar, allowing us to compare the evolutionary outcomes. However, to compare the evolution of the full-length TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb, we had to devise a setup in which the integrity of the NIb gene is ensured for TEV. Two previous studies have found that marker genes were highly stable in the viral genome when many 1-week passages were performed, although the markers were quickly lost in longer passages (Dolja et al. 1993; Zwart et al. 2014). By performing 30 one-week passages with TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb in N. tabacum 35S::NIb, we therefore hoped to avoid the occurrence of large genomic deletions in TEV. On the other hand, we realize that selection may not operate as effectively as during longer passages, due to short passage duration and frequent bottleneck associated to the mechanical transmissions among plants.\n",

            "text": "All evolved lineages of TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb were fully sequenced to determine whether there were differences in their patterns of molecular evolution. We were particularly interested in understanding whether the use of NIb in trans may have affected the regulation of expression and accumulation of all other viral components. Mutational spectra for both viral genotypes were dominated by point mutations as not a single insertion or deletion was observed (table 2). As anticipated, the passaging setup used leads to the retention of NIb cistron by all TEV lineages, and by contrasting the evolution of TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb, we are therefore considering the evolutionary effects of having a full-length or truncated genome. There were no differences between ratios of transitions to transversions; the ratio was 8.5 for TEV and 6.0 for TEV-\u0394NIb (Fisher\u2019s exact test: P = 1.000). Given that it is biochemically easier to produce transitions than transversions, it is not surprising to observe these biased ratios. Likewise, there was not a significant difference in the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions between the two viruses (Fisher\u2019s exact test: P = 0.330); for TEV, this ratio was 1.375 whereas for TEV-\u0394NIb it was 0.636. For both genotypes, mutations were evenly distributed along the genome (fig. 4A; Kolgomorov\u2013Smirnov test: TEV n = 19, P = 0.330; TEV-\u0394NIb n = 21, P = 0.688). An interesting example of convergent evolution was mutation A6805G (K2269E) that appeared in 80% of TEV lineages and in 40% of TEV-\u0394NIb lineages. This nonsynonymous mutation is localized in a superficial domain of NIaPro (Nunn et al. 2005), and it could affect the proteinase function or modulate the interactions of NIaPro with other proteins. This same mutation has also been previously reported in serial-passage evolution experiments of TEV in N. tabacum: in 10% of lineages after 15 one-week passages (Bedhomme et al. 2012), and in 30% of lineages after three 9-week passages (Zwart et al. 2014).\n\n",

Each mutation was observed in a single lineage, and combinations thereof were not observed. The E1206D mutation at the P6 site may only weakly affect the proteolytic processing as amino acids E and D are widely represented in Potyviridae family at this site (Adams et al. 2005). On the other hand, I1208V at position P4 should have a stronger impact on processing activity; in only 7% of all Potyviridae is I present at this site, whereas V is present in 80% (Adams et al. 2005). Similarly, T1210M in P2 may also have a strong impact on processivity: T is found at the P2 site in only 2% of the Potyviridae (2%).

Here, we used an experimental model system to study the effects of NIRV expression on virus populations, using TEV and transgenic tobacco plants expressing its replicase, NIb. We found that 1) the loss of NIb cistron leads to higher within-host fitness in transgenic plants, 2) that genomic deletions quickly accumulate in a full-length virus passaged in transgenic plants, and 3) that the evolution of a virus population can be contingent upon the deletion of virus genes, although many aspects of phenotypic and molecular evolution were unchanged. Overall, our results therefore suggest that the expression of NIRVs could have far-reaching consequences for virus evolution. Moreover, these effects can occur on relatively short timescales (i.e., deletion variants were generated de novo and reached frequencies of \u223c 0.25 within four 3-week passages). These changes on short timescales support the notion that plausible epidemiological models of virus spread in NIRV-expressing host populations need to take virus evolution into consideration. For example, if large genomic deletions occur rapidly in NIRV-expressing hosts, then eventually many virus-infected hosts will only be infectious to those hosts expressing the NIRV. The generation of various classes of infectious hosts could in this case decrease viral transmission between hosts, an effect that could be further augmented by the clustering of NIRV-expressing hosts.",

            "text": "Our results provide further support for the notion of a relationship between genome size and replication/within-host competitive fitness (Sakai et al. 1999; Marks et al. 2005; Zwart et al. 2010, 2014), although there are clearly limitations to this idea (Bull et al. 2004). Not only could TEV-\u0394NIb outcompete TEV in transgenic plants, also all independent TEV lineages accumulate various NIb deletions upon passaging. We identified 64 different deletion variants, most of which conserved the reading frame. In 17 deletion variants the deletion extended far into the upstream cistron, NIaPro, while for eight deletion variants, the deletion also extended into the downstream cistron, CP. Because both NIaPro and CP proteins are essential for virus replication and these deletions removed one or more proteolytic cleavage sites, the virus variants probably cannot replicate autonomously, even in the transgenic plants. Therefore, the virus population in the simulated NIRV-expressing host appears to have generated two types of defective viruses: 1) those with deletions in NIb only and can replicate autonomously in the transgenic plants but not in the wild-type plants and 2) those with deletions extending beyond the NIb cistron, which cannot replicate autonomously in either host. On the basis of these observations, we speculate that the NIRV-expressing hosts may be a source of defective genotypes in natural virus populations. If a deletion genotype arises de novo in a NIRV-expressing host, it will not require coinfection with a full-length virus to be maintained in the population. Consequently, it may more easily reach intermediate to high frequencies in a NIRV-expressing plant, allowing the defective virus to be sustained even in non-NIRV hosts by coinfection with full-length viruses (Montville et al. 2005). Complementation can slow down the rate at which deleterious alleles are eliminated from the virus population (Froissart et al. 2004; Sardany\u00e9s and Elena 2010) and promote selection for defective-interfering particles as cheater genotypes that reduce mean population fitness (Turner and Chao 1999).",

From a biosafety standpoint, it has been known for several years that recombination between viral sequences transgenically expressed by plants and virus genomes may occur (Turturo et al. 2008; Morroni et al. 2009), raising concerns about whether this transgenic strategy would favor the emergence of new viruses (Tepfer 2002; Thompson and Tepfer 2010). Here, we have illustrated a different evolutionary scenario: the expression by the plant of functional viral proteins creates the conditions in which viruses with long or even full deletions of the complemented protein may dominate the population, thus precluding their spread in nontransgenic plants.",

Although many examples of DNA viruses using host enzymes for replication exist (e.g., geminiviruses and polydnaviruses), no RNA virus has been described so far that does not encode for its own functional RdRp, even though certain plants encode functional RdRps of viral origin in their genomes, for example, the narnavirus-like RdRp found in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana (Hong et al. 1998). In this respect, a critical reader may argue that RdRp was not the best choice for studying the pseudogenization of viral genes in the presence of a homologous NIRV. However, our results should be strong enough to convince such a reader that even a highly constrained gene, such as RdRp can be lost from viral genomes if provided in trans by the host.",
