            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a major problem for cattle breeders worldwide, causing serious economic losses. BRDC is associated with infection by certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites (33). In addition to these infectious agents, stress factors such as transport, gestation, and poor management conditions play an important role in the onset of the disease (30). Bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) are the most common viral agents of the respiratory system. Some opportunistic agents (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus, and Mycoplasma spp.) contribute to the appearance of clinical signs and thus increase mortality and cause losses in the herds (18). Suppressed immunity also has an important role in the prognosis. Diseases such as bovine leucosis and bovine viral diarrhoea suppress immunity and lead to more animal loss by worsening clinical symptoms.",

These genotypes, termed A, B, and C, were differentiated based on phylogenetic analysis. Genotype A strains have been isolated in North America, China, and Japan. Genotype B was originally found in Australia. Isolations of genotype C were in China, South Korea, and Japan. In addition, all three genotypes have been reported in Argentina (23).",

Additionally, Valarcher et al.

Therefore, six subgroups were detected in BRSV. These subgroups termed I (the subgroup B prior to the recommendation of Valarcher et al. (36)), III (subgroup A), and II, IV, V, and VI (subgroup AB) were differentiated based on phylogenetic analysis. Subgroup I consists of European strains (UK and Switzerland). Subgroup III includes viruses exclusively from the USA. Subgroup II aggregates strains from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan. Subgroup IV is of European and USA strains while subgroups V and VI are found only in French and Belgian isolates (29, 36). Subgroup VII was detected in later years (9) and some strains are known which are still not classified (these are regarded as untyped) (10).",

However, when there is a co-infection, they may cause bronchopneumonia, severe cough, high fever, and nasal discharge and contribute to a more serious clinical course of infection (33). Regardless of the infecting agent in BRDC, clinical symptoms may be similar and the process of detecting the underlying primal agent may be hindered due to mixed bacterial infections. This situation makes viral diagnosis difficult and decreases the specificity and sensitivity of the molecular methods (when compared to immunofluorescence antibody tests) (15).",

Pirtle and Beran (27) reported that when diluted to 105.5 CCID50/mL and used to contaminate different kinds of media, the viability time was 1.5 h on rubber gloves, 20 min on skin, and a maximum of 6 h on an indoor surface. This is why samples must be admitted to the laboratory in a short time and tested in the shortest time possible. When low positivity rates are considered, both in this study and worldwide, there is always the possibility of false negativity because of virus sensitivity. PCRs specific for the gene-encoding fusion region for BRSV and the matrix gene for BPIV3 were used. The fusion gene of BRSV is a region that determines antigenic variations (26), and the matrix gene for BPIV3 is responsible for viral assembly, pathogenesis, and antigenicity of strains (20, 21). Phylogenetic analysis of BRSV based on the F protein sequence classified the isolates into seven different subgroups. The topology of the phylogeny was retained when an analysis of the N and G protein gene sequences was conducted (36). In our study, the determined strain was found to belong to subgroup III. Knowing the genotypes helps to determine the type-specific vaccine selection in the geographic region. Valarcher et al. (36) identified vaccine failure among animals infected with BRSV groups V and VI, indicating that commercial vaccines act poorly against infections caused by such viral groups. Therefore, selection of vaccines is important and should be specific to the type of strains present in the region. For example in the 2000s in Europe, vaccines including Rispoval RS (strain RB-94, subgroup II), Bayovac (strain Lehmkuhl 375, subgroup III), and Vacores (strain 220/69, subgroup II) were used. If these vaccines were currently in use, Bayovac could be suitable for our country. However, in vivo trials would be required for other vaccines. Therefore, genotyping studies of viruses are necessary for molecular epidemiology and vaccine studies.",

Analysis of the partial sequence of BRSV shows that our strains were more closely related to American and Brazilian (USA: KU159366; and Brazil: FJ543092) strains instead of European ones. Although the strains identified in the study are expected to be close to the European strains (because of the geographical location of Turkey), the increase in meat and live animal imports into our country over the last 5 years may be a factor in this situation, because our country imports meat from USA, Canada, Brazil, and Uruguay. Many infectious diseases may be spread among cities, countries, and continents as a result of animal or animal product transportation (12, 16). In our study, BRSV sequences showed high genetic similarity with the American and Brazilian strains. This genetic similarity among BRSV strains suggests that it could have come from Brazil or America, as a result of live animal exports.",

There is a need for additional epidemiological studies to better understand the prevalence and control of the infections. Regional and local infections should be investigated and properly addressed through random sampling. For implementing control and eradication studies at a national level, full genome sequence data should be provided in further studies.",
