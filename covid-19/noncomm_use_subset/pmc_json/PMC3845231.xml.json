The Senior Leadership Seminar was held in June 21, 2013, to discuss opinions of multiple ministries and agencies as well as areas of improvement among high-ranking officials from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States of America (USA). This exercise was cohosted by the Korean Ministry of National Defense and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare and by their counterpart in the United States (U.S.), the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The exercise directors are Director of Centers for Infectious Disease Control and Prevention in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Director of Armaments Verification in the Ministry of National Defense. Furthermore, 10 related ministries and agencies participated, including the President's Office, National Intelligence Service, National Police Agency, and National Environmental Management Agency. The AR13's scenario is composed of a series of bioattacks in Seoul, Korea, and the ministries and agencies of both countries collaborate with each other in responding to the attack [6].",

Since the preparation of the 2006 pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the ROK has prepared and periodically evaluated the plan to respond to various public health crises including pandemic influenza. The ROK has stockpiled 13,000,000 doses of antiviral drugs covering 26% of the Korean population and has 519 isolated beds in 16 medical institutions. The division of public health crisis in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in charge of responding to public health crisis caused by emerging infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza human infection, and pandemic influenza. Its job description includes preparing and responding to public health crisis caused by emerging infectious diseases, securing medical resources during crisis, activating the emergency response plan during the crisis, and fortification of capabilities of public health personnel. It could evolve into a comprehensive national agency to deal with public health crisis based on the experience of previous national emerging infectious diseases [7].",
