No supplements, vitamins, or minerals were given to the herd. The\nherd also had limited access to grass in the feedlot.

Both calves in this study had\npapilledema, accompanied by vision loss.

In growing\nanimals, an increase in CSF pressure is a significant event brought about by hypovitaminosis\nA [1]; faulty absorption and increased resistance to\noutflow are the possible causes for this increase [1].",

            "text": "In a previous study, the clinical signs of hypovitaminosis A were observed in male cattle,\nsimilar to the calves in this case study [7]. In\naddition, it is notable that among the herd of 11 cattle, it was the 2 youngest calves that\nwere affected with blindness from vitamin A deficiency. On a diet deficient in vitamin A,\nthe length of time until clinical signs develop is dependent on the extent of the liver\nstores. Young animals have small stores but require more vitamin A; thus, they are more\nsusceptible to hypovitaminosis A [3]. Because the\nliver is the normal site for vitamin A storage, measuring the vitamin A concentration in the\nliver might allow for the detection of hypovitaminosis A [7]. It has also been reported that the clinical signs of hypovitaminosis A develop\nbetween 6 and 12 months of being administered a diet deficient in vitamin A, after the\ndepletion of vitamin A stores in the liver [6]. In\nthis study, both calves were suckling or weaning; therefore, it was suggested that the cows\nhad developed early onset hypovitaminosis A [7]. Thus,\nthe other 9 cattle should have been tested to measure their serum vitamin A levels, as\ncattle can be affected by varying degrees of blindness and early blindness can be reversed\nby vitamin A therapy [3, 9]. In this study, testing for all cattle was refused by the owner for\nfinancial reasons. The measurement of vitamin A content in the feed available to this herd\ncould have been helpful in confirming vitamin A deficiency [5], but it was unfortunately not tested. However, it has been reported that beef\ncattle fed with a diet composed of white lees, rice straw and concentrate feed without green\nforage, similar to the diet in this study, were affected with hypovitaminosis A, and the\nvitamin A content of the cattle diet was demonstrated to be far below normal values [5]. Blindness resulting from hypovitaminosis A can be\nclassified into one of three types: 1) night blindness related to the deficiency of the\nvisual pigment rhodopsin made from vitamin A, which is reversible; 2) degenerative changes\nin the retina associated with prolonged vitamin A deficiency; and 3) stenosis of the optic\ncanal, which induces an irreversible loss of vision [9]. However, the earliest signs of night blindness, which can be reversed by\nadministering a vitamin A supplement, generally go unnoticed by cattle owners [3]. In this study, the two affected calves could not\nregain their vision following dietary supplementation with vitamin A. This suggested that\nthe dietary vitamin supplements alone might not be enough to reverse blindness, or that\nblindness might be the result of permanent optic nerve necrosis and/or retinal degeneration\ndue to vascular impairment caused by a narrowed optic canal due to altered skeletal growth\n[3, 6].",

TMR consists of minimal forage and a high\nproportion of grain, thus increasing growth in and profitability of feedlot cattle [8]. However, hypovitaminosis A has been reported to occur\nin cattle fed on rations with insufficient green forage [6, 7]. Hypovitaminosis A can be treated with\nan intramuscular injection of aqueous vitamin A or, more economically, a dietary supplement\n[3, 7].\nTreatment with intramuscular injection of vitamin A at 3,000\u20136,000 iu/kg every 60 days\n[3] or continuous dietary supplement containing 80\niu/kg (for cattle on a high energy ration) or 100 iu/kg (for a pregnant cow or a growing\nheifer) vitamin A daily has been recommended in previous studies [3, 6]. A case study also reported\nthat 5,000 iu/head vitamin A added to the ration daily and the administration of a\nlong-acting vitamin A preparation during winter can prevent ocular problems as well as\nabortion or infertility [7]. Long-term supplementation\nof vitamin A according to the stage of production and reevaluations of serum vitamin A\nlevels are required to prevent new cases of blindness arising from hypovitaminosis A [3, 6].",
