However,\nthe relative burden of other pathogens, e.g. rhinovirus and parainfluenza is less\nwell understood.

Organisms were chosen that were found to be important in previous\nwork 2 and were available from routine laboratory testing. Syndromic data included\nconsultations with family doctors (called General Practitioners or GPs), calls to a\nnational telephone helpline \u201cNHS 111\u201d and attendances at emergency\ndepartments (EDs). Associations between laboratory reports and syndromic data were\nexamined over four winter seasons (weeks 40 to 20), between 2011 and 2015. Multiple\nlinear regression was used to model correlations and to estimate the proportion of\nsyndromic consultations associated with specific pathogens. Finally, burden\nestimates were used to infer the proportion of patients affected by specific\npathogens that would be diagnosed with different symptoms.",
