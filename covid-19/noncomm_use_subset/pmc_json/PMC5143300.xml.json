NAFLD is a condition where fat, mainly triglycerides (TG), accumulates in the hepatocytes of patients who have not consumed excessive amounts of alcohol (4). Estimates of the prevalence of NAFLD range from 6.3% to 33%, depending on the population (56), and are expected to rise as obesity rates increase, populations become older, and physical activity levels decrease (4). Moreover, there is an increased prevalence of NAFLD in T2D patients (7), and its severity may be aggravated by T2D (89). However, beyond epidemiology, there are many challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.",

            "text": "As patients with NAFLD are mostly asymptomatic, the gold standard for its diagnosis is based on liver biopsy, which is highly invasive and expensive. Alternatively, imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are used for NAFLD diagnosis (10). Among these methods, abdominal US is commonly used due to its relatively low expense. However, the major drawbacks of US include its inability to quantify liver fat amounts and its variability due to examiner techniques. Recently, a novel physical index, called controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), has been developed based on the properties of ultrasonic signals examined by transient liver elastography (Fibroscan\u00ae; Echosens, Paris, France). CAP relies on the concept that fat attenuates US propagation, and it non-invasively quantizes this ultrasonic attenuation at the center frequency of the FibroScan\u00ae M probe (3.5 MHz) (11). Furthermore, a large prospective study has demonstrated the accuracy of CAP in diagnosing NAFLD (12).",

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) have recommended vitamin E supplementation for NAFLD patients without diabetes, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) for NAFLD patients with diabetes (5). TZDs are potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists that lower blood glucose levels by ameliorating systemic insulin sensitivity and inflammation (13). Recently, a novel TZD called lobeglitazone was developed, and is currently being prescribed for T2D in Korea (14). The efficacy and safety of lobeglitazone in T2D has been well-investigated (151617). To identify better treatment options for T2D patients with NAFLD, we investigated the effects of lobeglitazone on these patients by analyzing alterations in their CAP values using transient liver elastography, as well as in their glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles.",

If a patient\u2019s HbA1C value exceeded 8.5% at 12 weeks after treatment, rescue medication (2.0 mg glimepiride) was introduced. The primary endpoint was change in CAP, as measured by transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae), from baseline to the end of 24-week lobeglitazone treatment. The secondary endpoints were changes from baselines in multiple values and parameters, including HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated albumin (GA), liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], and gamma glutamyl transferase [\u03b3GTP]), lipid profile components (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], and TG), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). In addition, alterations from baseline in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR), which was quantified based on FPG and fasting insulin levels, were used as secondary endpoints. During the study period, patients visited the clinic for initial screening and baseline measurement, in addition to weeks 12 and 24. During both the initial screening and at 12- and 24-week visits, fasting blood samples for all subjects, as well as urine pregnancy tests for female participants of child-bearing age, were taken for laboratory assessment. At the baseline visit, CAP and liver US were performed. At the 24-week visit, CAP was performed again. Before entering the study, we assessed the daily dietary and exercise routines of all participants, and then, they were educated and asked to maintain a calorie limited-diet while performing more than 150 min/week of medium-intensity aerobic exercise.",

Analysis of baseline characteristics showed that the participants had a mean age of 52 years, body mass index (BMI) of 27.5 kg/m2, and HbA1C of 7.4% (57.4 mM) (Table 1). The average levels of HOMAIR, AST, ALT, and \u03b3GTP were 5.5 \u00b1 4.1 IU/L, 31.7 \u00b1 16.1 IU/L, 43.7 \u00b1 28.0 IU/L, and 52.3 \u00b1 40.2 IU/L, respectively. The mean CAP value was 313.4 \u00b1 30.9 dB/m, and the mean LSM value was 6.4 \u00b1 2.7 kPa. At baseline visit, about 53% of the patients were prescribed and, reportedly, taking metformin.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that lobeglitazone, a novel TZD, could alleviate hepatic steatosis and improve hepatic function in T2D patients with CAP-proven NAFLD. In this multicenter, prospective, and exploratory trial, transient liver elastography assessed that a 24-week treatment with lobeglitazone had significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis in T2D patients with NAFLD, independent of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone treatment also resulted in improved glycemic profiles with reduced HbA1C and HOMAIR values, lipid profiles with increased HDL-C and decreased TG levels, and liver profiles with decreased AST, ALT, and \u03b3GTP levels. Multiple linear regression analyses further demonstrated that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline CAP values, metformin use, and changes in LSM and ALT levels.",

Similarly, in this study, we demonstrated that lobeglitazone treatment in NAFLD patients improved hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP, and liver enzyme profiles, as assessed by aminotransferase and \u03b3GTP levels, but not liver fibrosis, based on measurements of liver stiffness. Because this was not a liver-biopsy proven study, we could not assess alterations in hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning following treatment. Regarding CAP, previous studies have analyzed the association of CAP values with liver histology, particularly in NAFLD patients with high-grade steatosis and elevated BMI, and have verified the utility of CAP as a non-invasive tool for diagnosing and monitoring NAFLD patients (27282930). However, despite its relatively high accuracy in detecting hepatic steatosis, the agreement between histologic analysis and CAP in hepatic fat quantification varies among individuals with mild steatosis (27). Thus, for our study, we recruited T2D subjects with NAFLD using a higher cut-off CAP value (250 dB/m).",

With the exception of these two subjects, participants showed improved glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1C and GA levels. Interestingly, although CAP values were only significantly reduced in the responder group, HbA1C values were significantly reduced in both the responder and non-responder groups. These data suggest that the reduction in hepatosteatosis is independent of the degree of glycemic control.",

Nevertheless, TZDs have also been shown to reduce liver fat content and enhance peripheral tissue glucose uptake (31). In this regard, the negative side effects of TZDs on weight gain should be viewed in a balanced manner. Previous studies have shown that pioglitazone treatment increases body weight between 2.5 and 4.7 kg, depending on the study (232425). In our study, lobeglitazone treatment showed a lower increase in the average body weight of 1.4 kg (from 76.5 \u00b1 11.1 kg to 77.9 \u00b1 11.8 kg [P = 0.001]), which is similar to the weight gain, ranging from 0.89 to 1.48 kg, that was observed in other clinical trials using 0.5 mg/day lobeglitazone (151617).",

            "text": "In this study, we identified predictive factors that were associated with lobeglitazone responsiveness, and found that individuals with higher values of CAP, WBC, and ALT, and lower values of LSM and \u03b3GTP at baseline showed greater reductions in hepatic fat following lobeglitazone treatment. Although most previous trials with TZDs did not analyze predictors of responsiveness, a trial with rosiglitazone showed that responders have lower baseline \u03b3GTP levels and higher baseline amounts of steatosis than non-responders (22), which is consistent with our findings. Similar to previous studies (2225), we also observed greater reductions in the ALT levels of responders, compared with those observed in non-responders, following treatment. Previous studies have also shown that responders show greater increments in serum adiponectin levels after TZD treatment than non-responders (2223). Furthermore, Ratziu et al. (22) reported greater reductions in insulin levels in responders to rosiglitazone than in non-responders, which we did not observe in our trial. Such difference was likely due to the fact that 100% of patients in our study had diabetes, whereas only 32% of the patients in the Ratziu et al. (22) study had diabetes. Moreover, our multiple regression analysis demonstrated that patients treated with metformin and lobeglitazone showed a greater reduction in hepatic steatosis than patients treated with lobeglitazone alone. Previous RCTs have shown inconsistent effects using metformin alone to treat NAFLD (533); thus, the combination of metformin and lobeglitazone may synergistically act to reduce hepatic fat. One plausible explanation could be that they act together on the pathogenic heterogeneities in NAFLD. For example, lobeglitazone may play a role in decreasing the availability of plasma fatty acids arising from adipose tissue through abated lipolysis and the positive distribution of fat mass; on the other hand, metformin may activate either fatty acid oxidation or lipophagy, as well as mitophagy, via upregulation of the adenosine monophosphate kinase and/or sirtuin 1 pathways (3435). In addition, metformin may ameliorate the adverse effects of weight gain caused by TZD treatment.",

Lobeglitazone is a novel TZD; thus, its long-term safety in treating patients with NAFLD has not been established. Moreover, findings from the current study should be taken with some caution in that our clinical trials included a relatively small number of participants, without having any quality control for CAP measurements conducted by the five centers. Additionally, we did not perform liver biopsy, which is the gold standard method, to evaluate the status of NAFLD because it is a highly invasive and costly procedure. Furthermore, our study does not clearly show how lobeglitazone works on NAFLD. Finally, we performed a single-arm trial without a placebo or an active arm. However, even with these limitations, the current study has several strengths: First, we conducted a study with the novel drug lobeglitazone to assess its additional benefits on NAFLD in T2D patients. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to demonstrate that CAP can be used as a simple, non-invasive tool to quantify and monitor changes in liver fat content during intervention. Finally, we identified several parameters that may be used to predict NAFLD-patient response to lobeglitazone treatment.",

Furthermore, increased steatosis grade and metformin use in patients at baseline, as well as decreased ALT and LSM levels after treatment, were all reliable factors in predicting responsiveness to lobeglitazone.
