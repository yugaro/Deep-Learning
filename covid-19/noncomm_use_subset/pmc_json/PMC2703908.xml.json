Some more recent phylogenomic studies are based on concatenation of a larger number of proteins. The ever burgeoning genome sequencing projects worldwide have prompted several whole-genome phylogenetic approaches. However, most\u2014if not all\u2014rely on sequence alignment at some stage and therefore depend on many parameters, such as the use of scoring matrices. As modern prokaryotic and fungal taxonomy depends more and more on the traditional phylogeny, there is an urgent need to develop alternative approaches.",

In this page, we provide trees partially \u2018collapsed\u2019 to certain taxonomic level according to the NCBI taxonomy. The necessity of so doing requires some explanation. At present, the progress of prokaryotic and fungal phylogeny has made detailed comparison with taxonomy feasible. However, it is not easy to comprehend a tree with hundreds or more leaves. To simplify the job, we collapse an original genome tree to different taxonomic levels taking monophyleticity of branches as a guiding principle. For example, at the phylum level the 36 species/strains classified as Cyanobacteria do form a monophyletic branch. This branch is replaced by a single node labeled by Cyanobacteria{36}. The reduction can only be partial, as, for example, the phylum Proteobacteria does not appear as a monophyletic group in a tree. However, three out of the five classes in this phylum do form monophyletic branches. Therefore, Alphaproteobacteria{104}, Betaproteobacteria{62} and Epsilonproteobacteria{24} nodes appear when the tree is collapsed to class level. In this way, the number of leaves in a collapsed tree may be greatly reduced.",
