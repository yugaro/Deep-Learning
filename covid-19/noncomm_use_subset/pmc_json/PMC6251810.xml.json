            "text": "Steroidal glycosides (SGs) are characterized by a steroidal skeleton glycosidically linked to sugar moieties, which can be further acylated with aliphatic and aromatic acids thus forming complex acylated steroidal glycosides (ASGs)1. The resulting steroidal glycoside esters (SGEs) exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, like cholesterol-lowering effect2, anti-diabetic properties3, anti-complementary activity4, immunoregulatory functions5, 6 and anti-cancer actions7, 8, 9, which made ASGs promising compounds with pharmaceutical potential. Numerous methods, including direct extraction9, chemical synthesis10, 11 and biosynthesis12, have been developed to synthesize these acylated steroidal glycosides. Direct extraction from varied organisms is one of the main methods to obtain ASGs7, 8, 9. However, the content of ASGs was usually low in natural sources7, 8, 9. Moreover, the extraction routes were highly time-consuming and required laborious purification procedures7, 8, 9, 13, resulting in poor yields and/or low purity of the final products. The production of ASGs was also achieved by chemical synthesis previously10, 11, 12, 13, 14. However, these efforts often encounter a fundamental challenge, namely, regioselective acylation of single hydroxyl group of unprotected SGs in the late stage of the chemical synthesis of ASGs. SGs generally possess multiple hydroxyl groups with similar reactivity. Regioselective acylation of a particular one of multiple hydroxyl groups generally requires multi-step protection/deprotection procedures, which makes the synthetic pathway of these SGEs costly, wasteful, long and time-consuming, and results in low yield in the end.",

Theoretically, the biosynthesis of ASGs includes two steps. In the first reaction, the sugar moiety from nucleotide-activated glycosyl donors was attached to steroids at different positions, most commonly at the C-3 hydroxyl group (OH), under the action of nucleotide dependent SGTs15, 16. The glycosylation of a hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of steroids was well characterized and a few of steroidal 3\u03b2-glucosyltransferases were isolated from diverse species17, 18. However, the reports of SGTs specific for positions other than C-3 of steroids are limited.",

Up to date, no SGA genes has yet been cloned, which in turn limit the enzyme-mediated biosynthesis of ASGs. Hence, the successful gene isolation and functional characterization of SGAs have become a prominent challenge for bioproduction of ASGs. Herein, the functional characterizations of a plant-derived SGT with activity against both 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl steroids, and a bacterial SGA, as well as their application in the biosynthesis of ASGs are reported. Initially, a steroidal glycosyltransferase OsSGT1 was isolated from medicinal plant O. saundersiae and showed activities for 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl steroids. Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify the function of OsSGT1, we characterized LacA protein (designated as EsSGA1) from E. coli as a SGA, catalyzing testosterone-17-O-\u03b2-glucoside (T-17\u03b2-G) and estradiol-17-O-\u03b2-glucoside (E-17\u03b2-G) to form corresponding acylates. Further, under the synergistic actions of OsSGT1 and EsSGA1, the biosynthetic preparation of two acylated steroidal glycosides (ASGs), namely acetylated T-17\u03b2-Gs (AT-17\u03b2-Gs) and E-17\u03b2-Gs (AE-17\u03b2-Gs), was first achieved, thereby yielding four monoacetylated steroidal glucosides, namely 2\u2032-O, 3\u2032-O, 4\u2032-O and 6\u2032-O-acylates (Scheme 1). The cytotoxic activities of these monoacylates were evaluated against seven human tumor cell lines (HCT116, Bel7402, MGC803, Capan2, NCI-H460, NCI-H1650 and A549) and 3\u2032-acetylated testosterone17-O-\u03b2-glucoside was observed to display improved cytotoxic activity against these seven cell lines (Scheme 1).",

O. saundersiae is thus selected as the candidate plant for SGTs isolation. The transcriptome of O. saundersiae was thus sequenced with the aim of isolating genes encoding SGTs. A total of 92,995,146 raw reads were generated after the transcriptome sequencing of O. saundersiae. After removal of dirty reads with adapters, unknown or low quality bases, a total of 82,518,740 clean reads were retained. These clean reads were combined by assembling soft trinity to form longer unigenes. Finally, an RNA-seq database containing 107,084 unigenes with mean length of 766 bp was obtained. Next, these unigenes were aligned to publicly available protein databases for functional annotations, retrieving unigenes displaying the highest sequence similarity with SGTs. Unigene 32070 with 2182 bp in length was thus retrieved from the unigene database for its high similarity with SGTs (Supplementary Information Fig. S1). Moreover, ORF Finder result showed that this unigene contained a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 1773 bp, starting at nucleotide 99 with an ATG start codon and ending at position 1871 with a TGA stop codon. The unigene contained 98 bp of 5\u2032-UTR (untranslated region) and 311 bp of 3\u2032-UTR. Therefore, unigene 32070 was selected for further investigation.",

Each member of the acceptor library (1\u201449, Fig. 1B and Supplementary Information Fig. S4) was first assessed as sugar acceptor for OsSGT1-mediated glucosylation with UDP-Glc as the donor. The glycosyl-transferring reactions were monitored by HPLC\u2014UV/MS analysis (Supplementary Information Table S3). Of the 49 substrates, only 10 steroids were observed to be glucosylated by OsSGT1, forming corresponding monoglucosides (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Supplementary Information Figs. S5\u201314). The ten steroids included seven 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroids (1\u20147, Supplementary Information Figs. S5\u201311), two 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids (8\u20149, Figure 2, Figure 3) and one 3\u03b2,17\u03b2-dihydroxysteroid (10, Supplementary Information Fig. S14). The reaction activities of OsSGT1 towards the ten substrates indicated that OsSGT1 was an SGT showing activities towards both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroids, consistent with the predicted result by bioinformatics analyses (Supplementary Information Figs. S1 and S3). In fact, the reports of SGTs with glycosylation activity against steroids at positions other than C-3 were limited and only three SGTs from yeast were verified to exhibit selectivity towards both 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids17. OsSGT1 was therefore viewed as the first plant SGT with selectivity towards both 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Supplementary Information Figs. S5\u201314). However, the glycosylation activity of OsSGT1 towards 17\u03b2-hydroxyl group would be lost if additional hydroxyl group at 2\u03b2-(2\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 13), 15\u03b2-(15\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 14), 16\u03b2-(16\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 15), or 16\u03b1-position (16\u03b1-OH-testosterone, 16), even a methyl group at C17-position (methyltestosterone and its derivatives, 17\u201420) was attached to testosterone (8), generating not any glycosylated products. Moreover, OsSGT1 has no activity towards other compounds, including steroids without 3\u03b2- and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl groups (11\u201412 and 21\u201424), flavonoids (25\u201431), alkaloids (32\u201438), triterpenoids (39\u201442), phenolic acids (43\u201447) and coumarins (48\u201449) as shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S4.",

The 13C NMR glycosylation shifts (\u0394\u03b4, \u03b4glucoside\u2014\u03b4aglycon) of these glycosides were thus examined to ascertain the glycosylation position (Table 1, and Supplementary Information Tables S4\u201311). The steroidal glycosides were observed to have significant glycosylation shift \u0394\u03b4s for C-3 (glycosides 1\u20146) or C-17 position (compounds 8\u20149), showing their 3- or 17-glycosides.

This bacterial strain contains at least 35 putative acetyltransferase genes, in which lacA, maa and wecH, were predicted to encode O-acetyltransferase (Supplementary Information Table S15). As shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S56, further sequence analyses revealed WecH protein was a membrane-bound protein with a total of 10 membrane-spanning helixes, inconsistent with the above results, in which the candidate acetyltransferase was determined to be a soluble protein in bacterial lysate. LacA and Maa proteins were predicted to have no transmembrane helixes, suggesting their soluble form in bacterial. Thus, the remaining two genes, lacA and maa, were further investigated. First, the entire ORFs of the two genes were isolated from bacterial genome using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Information Fig. S57A and Table S1). The ORFs of lacA and maa genes were 612 and 552 bp encoding polypeptides of 203 and 183 aa, respectively. The predicted molecular weights of the two proteins were 22.77 and 20.1 kDa. The two genes were then inserted into pET-28a(+) to generate two recombinant vectors, which were introduced into BL21(DE3) for heterologous expression. After isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction, the accumulation of approximately 23 or 20 kDa was observed in the lysate of bacterial strain harboring pET28a-lacA or pET28a-maa (Supplementary Information Fig. S57B). Moreover, the presence of bacterially-expressed His-LacA or His-Maa fusion protein in the bacterial lysate was verified by Western-blot with anti-His antibody (Supplementary Information Fig. S57C). The expressed LacA or Maa protein was then purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography (Supplementary Information Fig. S57B).",

LacA was thus designated as EcSGA1 (E. coli steroidal glucoside acetyltransferase) for convenience hereinafter and submitted to GenBank with an accession number of MF688777. It is generally accepted that hydrolases and acyltransferases are two classes of enzymes responsible for acylation reactions of SGs22. The enzymatic acylations reported now are largely performed by hydrolases like lipases22. On the other hand, not any genes encoding SGAs are isolated up to date16, 22.

When testosterone (8) was incubated with the engineered strain BL21(DE3)[pET28a-OsSGT1+pGro7], not any new products were detected. On the other hand, when T-17\u03b2-G (8a) was added into the same whole-cell system, 6\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G (8b) was present in the reaction mixture (Supplementary Information Fig. S61). These data indicated that testosterone (8) could not be transported into the cell while the glycosylation of testosterone (8) significantly improved the intercellular transport. Thus, the formation of AT-17\u03b2-Gs (8b\u20148e) from testosterone (8) using the single whole-cell biocatalyst is infeasible. A two-step process is therefore established to address this limitation. Specifically, OsSGT1-catalyzed reaction was performed in the membrane-free crude cell extract of BL21 (DE3)[pET28a-OsSGT1+pGro7], while EcSGA1-mediated acetylation was conducted in the whole-cell system of BL21(DE3)[pET28a-EsSGA1].",

Next, the 100 \u03bcL screening scale of OsSGT1-catalyzed glycosylation reaction was scaled to 53 mL scale, in which 152 mg testosterone (8) were glycosylated to form 61 mg T-17\u03b2-G (8a) under optimized conditions (Scheme 1). The resultant T-17\u03b2-G (8a) was subsequently used as the substrate applied in the scale-up of the whole-cell system of BL21(DE3)[pET28a-EsSGA1] (135 mL) under optimized pH 5.0 and 40 \u00b0C. The resulting reaction mixture was subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography\u2014solid phase extraction\u2014NMR spectroscopy (HPLC\u2014SPE\u2014NMR) measurement. Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 8c\u20148e with those of 8b suggested that compounds 8c\u20148e had the same framework as 8b and the structural difference might be the position of the acetyl group. The location of acetyl group was determined to be at C-2\u2032 based on the HMBC correlations between H-2\u2032 (\u03b4 4.68) and C-1\" (\u03b4 170.3) as shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S63. Thus, compound 8c was assigned as 2\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G. The isolated glucose proton at \u03b4 4.91 (H-3\u2032) of compound 8d exhibited long-range correlations with carbonyl carbons at \u03b4 172.7 (Supplementary Information Fig. S64). Moreover, H-4\u2032 (\u03b4 4.73) of compound 8e showed long-range correlations with C-1\" (\u03b4 170.7), as revealed by the HMBC spectrum (Supplementary Information Fig. S65). These data supported that the structure of 8d and 8e was elucidated as 3\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G and 4\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G, respectively. Hence, the three trace products at tR = 18.243, 19.013 and 23.680 min were thus assigned to be 3\u2032-(8d), 4\u2032-(8e) and 2\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G (8c) based on their respective NMR data (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Supplementary Information Figs. S63\u201377). These data indicate that EcSGA1 can effectively introduce the acetyl group into the primary hydroxyl group and each secondary hydroxyl group of T-17\u03b2-G (8a), yielding four monoacylates without the formation of diacylates (Fig. 4 and Scheme 1). Because the primary C(6\u2032)-OH was the most reactive of the four hydroxyl groups in T-17\u03b2-G (8a), acetylation of T-17\u03b2-G (8a) took place preferentially at the C(6\u2032)-OH, giving 6\u2032-O-acylate predominantly in 82% yield (Fig. 4 and Scheme 1). Also, EcSGA1 can regioselectively acetylate each secondary hydroxyl of T-17\u03b2-G (8a) in the presence of the primary hydroxyl group, giving 2\u2032-(8c), 3\u2032-(8d) and 4\u2032-AT-17\u03b2-G (8e) in 8%, 6% and 4% yield, respectively. These data revealed the reactivity trend of hydroxyls is 6\u2032-OH>>2\u2032-OH>3\u2032-OH>4\u2032-OH.",

There are two enzymes, namely SGTs and SGAs, responsible for the biosynthesis of ASGs. To synthesize ASGs, the primary premise is to obtain glycosyltransferases capable of catalyzing the formation of SGs from the abundantly available free steroids. O. saundersiae is thus selected as the candidate plant for SGTs isolation. O. saundersiae is a monocotyledonous plant rich in acylated steroidal glycosides, suggesting that it may contain SGTs and SGAs responsible for the biosynthesis of ASGs23. Thus, the transcriptome of O. saundersiae was sequenced with the aim to facilitate the genes discovery. OsSGT1 was then isolated from O. saundersiae based on the RNA-Seq data. Subsequently, OsSGT1-containing cell-free extract was used as the biocatalyst for glycosylations of 49 structurally diverse drug-like scaffolds. The use of cell-free extract offers a number of advantages. Unlike the ambitious purification procedures, the preparation of cell-free extract was simple and time-saving. Moreover, compared the purified enzymes, the recombinant proteins used in crude extract-based system were more stable.",

It is well known that lacA is one of three structural genes (lacZ, lacY and lacA) in lac operon25, 26. The function of LacZ and LacY is well-characterized25, 26. LacZ encodes a \u03b2-galactosidase, catalyzing the cleavage of lactose into glucose and galactose. LacY encodes a lactose permease responsible for lactose uptake25, 26. The third structural protein encoded by lacA gene in lac operon was initially inferred to be an acetyltransferase. The exact action of this protein, however, remains in doubt until now. In this investigation, in an effort to identify the function of OsSGT1, we unexpectedly characterized LacA protein from E. coli as a SGA. In vitro enzymatic analyses revealed that LacA protein could specifically catalyze the attachment of acyl groups into the hydroxyl groups of sugar moieties of steroidal 17\u03b2-glycosides (Figure 4, Figure 5). Although we have no evidences for the role of LacA protein in vivo, these findings in the present work may provide a starting point for identifying the exact activity of LacA protein in lactose metabolism. The bottleneck in enzymatic synthesis of ASGs is the lack of well-characterized SGAs. The successful characterization of LacA made it to be the first SGA and LacA protein was thus designated as EcSGA1.",

Firstly, two SGs, T-17\u03b2-G (8a) and E-17\u03b2-G (9a), were prepared from their corresponding steroidal substrates testosterone (8) and estradiol (9) in the presence of a steroidal glycosyltransferase OsSGT1 from O. saundersiae. The resulting T-17\u03b2-G (8a) was further regioselectively acetylated under the action of an acyltransferase EcSGA1 from E. coli, thereby yielding four monoacetylated steroidal glucosides (8b\u20138e) with the yield ratio of 82:8:6:4. Likewise, E-17\u03b2-G (9a) was acetylated by EcSGA1 to form monoacetylated products 9b\u20139e in a ratio of 80:10:6:4.",
