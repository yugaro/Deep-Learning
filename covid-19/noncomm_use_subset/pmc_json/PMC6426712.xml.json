When delivered systemically, siRNA formulated within a lipid nanoparticle or carrying a hepatocyte-specific targeting ligand can trigger near-complete and highly specific mRNA silencing of numerous targets in the liver at well-tolerated doses.2, 3, 4 For certain indications, local delivery of siRNA (e.g., mucosal, intraocular, intrathecal) may be more desirable than the standard intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as it may enable higher oligonucleotide concentrations in relevant tissues and protection from systemic nucleases.5, 6 However, previous studies on local siRNA administration have yielded variable and unpredictable results, limiting its clinical relevance. These confounding results arise primarily by the need to achieve sufficient metabolic stability of siRNA while preserving its intrinsic RNAi activity and to avoid potential siRNA-induced innate immune responses, which have been historical challenges in the field. Overall, there is still a general paucity in understanding parameters that influence siRNA bioavailability and efficacy in non-liver tissues.",

Additional studies report inhaled naked siRNA efficacy against parainfluenza virus (PIV), as well as lung xenograft tumor growth.11, 12 Other groups have described how intratracheal or intranasal delivery of siRNA targeting effectors of Th2-driven inflammation like SOCS3 and STAT6 improved disease outcome in rodents, although direct target engagement in pathology-relevant cells was not conclusively demonstrated.13, 14 In contrast with these reports, Moschos et al.15 concluded that intratracheally delivered siRNA could not be internalized by cells and therefore lacked efficacy in the lung. Importantly, it should be noted that the lung delivery reports so far have used unmodified or partially modified siRNAs that are expected to have poor metabolic stability.",

The airway and lung are composed of a wide variety of cells with specific roles in pathology and homeostasis, including specialized epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and different hematopoietic cell subpopulations with complex immunological functions. In particular, the lung immune compartment contains pharmacological targets that can be modulated for therapeutic benefit in asthma, COPD, and autoimmune disease. Flow cytometry and cell sorting technologies have allowed a better definition of lung parenchymal cells and resident leukocyte populations.16, 17 In the present study, we have taken advantage of these technologies, particularly advances in fully modified siRNAs to provide exceptional metabolic stability,18 to evaluate the distribution and activity of siRNA within the lung for a systematic characterization of cell-type tropism and structure-activity relationship of siRNA chemistry. Finally, we use the allergen-induced model of lung inflammation to demonstrate the capacity of inhaled siRNA to ameliorate lung pathology.",

The sequences and chemical modification schemes used in this manuscript can be found in Figure S1. Synthesized siRNAs were dissolved in PBS and delivered without conjugation to cellular uptake agents (e.g., cholesterol) or association to any transfection-promoting reagents (e.g., liposomes) intratracheally using a microsprayer aerosolizer. Analysis of total lung RNA 3 days post-treatment revealed significant target knockdown in a dose-dependent fashion (up to 40% at 50 mg/kg) (Figure 1A). Importantly, crossover controls demonstrated that this effect was observed in each case only for the targeted gene, demonstrating mRNA knockdown occurs through an RNAi-mediated mechanism and not through non-specific inflammation-related events.",

As shown in Figure 2A, silencing activity triggered by chemically modified siRNA was significantly higher, suggesting a dependence on oligonucleotide stability for lung RNAi activity. We then compared the ability of si-Ctnnb1-2\u2032-OH and si-Ctnnb1 to induce inflammation. A time course analysis, which included E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control, demonstrated that the neutrophilia (Figure 2B) and pro-inflammatory cytokine elevation in the BAL fluid (Figure 2C) induced by si-Ctnnb1 2\u2032-OH were abrogated by the modifications included in the active si-Ctnnb1 siRNA. Intranasal LPS administration, which induces a strong inflammatory response, had no significant effect on Ctnnb1 levels. These data demonstrate that the modifications introduced in our siRNA design successfully prevent the activation of the innate immune system in the lung and rule out the possibility that non-specific inflammation contributes to the decrease in target mRNA levels.",

Analysis of mRNA levels showed that conjugation of the fluorescent label did not affect the RNAi activity of the siRNA (data not shown). The study revealed that early (2 h) after dosing by intratracheal delivery, siRNA localizes primarily to the muscular layer surrounding central arteries, with significant localization also to endothelial cells, the submucosal layer of upper airways, and alveolar epithelia (Figure 3A). This distribution pattern is subsequently lost, as the intense staining in the arterial region is significantly decreased 24 h post-dosing (Figure 3B). After 72 h, most of the fluorescent signal is observed in alveolar macrophages (Figure 3C). Importantly, we did not detect fluorescent siRNA in the bronchial epithelium at any of the time points analyzed. Higher magnification analysis at 2 h post-dose reveals siRNA localization to the lamina propria and smooth muscle layer area surrounding bronchi and bronchioles (Figure 3D). However, siRNAs designed against a smooth-muscle-specific gene marker (Pde4d) failed to induce gene knockdown activity at total lung RNA level, suggesting there is no productive siRNA delivery to smooth muscle cells (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggests that chemically modified unconjugated siRNA can distribute passively into lung cells, primarily alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia.",

To assess this possibility, we synthesized two siRNAs carrying PEG moieties of different molecular weight and configuration. Analysis of target mRNA levels 3 days post-dosing revealed that, despite carrying identical guide strands, passenger strand PEGylation rendered the siRNAs inactive (Figure 5A). Interestingly, the loss of activity did not correlate with lower siRNA content in the lung subsets analyzed. In fact, in support of our hypothesis, PEGylated siRNA content in the CD45neg cell population was up to 10-fold higher than control siRNA (Figure 5B).

Internalization and cytosolic release of single-stranded oligonucleotides heavily modified with phosphorothioate backbone can occur without the use of special delivery vehicles but remains an inefficient process.39 It is well established, however, that some cell types are far more permissive than others to oligonucleotide delivery,40 making necessary the characterization of siRNA biodistribution at a cellular resolution rather than solely at the organ level.",

In the same study, chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides were shown to accumulate in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelia but did not induce target knockdown. We now conclusively demonstrate that chemically modified siRNA can indeed mediate RNAi activity in multiple cells in the lung while avoiding immune system activation. The conflicting results can be explained by our optimization of chemical modifications that render the siRNA more resistant to lung nucleases and/or lysosomal degradation, increasing its in vivo half-life and facilitating cytosolic release, respectively. In correspondence with this idea, we observed that lung mRNA silencing is highly dependent on such chemical modifications, which confer resistance to circulating and intracellular nucleases. This finding agrees with the reports of extensive chemical modifications needed for intracellular stability of siRNA conjugates in liver.3",

Importantly, no targeting or other large functional group was required on the molecule to achieve pharmacological activity. Similar results were observed 7 days post-dosing or using an siRNA against a different target (Ssb), thus demonstrating the sequence-specific effect and by using a bolus instillation instead of intratracheal delivery.

However, a direct correlation between cellular siRNA content and mRNA knockdown cannot be established, since the epithelial (CD45negCD326+CD31neg) cell subset showed similar mRNA knockdown (60%) with 200-fold lower siRNA levels. Likewise, PEG conjugation abolished the activity of siRNA molecules while actually inducing a significant increase in cellular siRNA content.

Furthermore, we have shown these effects were dependent on the siRNA modification pattern employed, demonstrating that siRNA stabilization by chemical modifications is absolutely required for in vivo activity. In correspondence with the role of DC-expressed OX40L in memory Th2 responses, we observed a downregulation of IL-13, IL-5, and IgE in siRNA-dosed mice. However, we did not see statistically significant decrease in IL-4 or lung eosinophilia that would be expected by a complete downregulation of the Th2 recall response. Seshasayee et al. have proposed that study protocols using two sensitization doses instead of one result in longer-lasting effector responses that are not fully suppressed by OX40L-blocking reagents.38 Considering this possibility, we started challenging mice 21 days after our second sensitization dose. For comparison, a Hoshino et al.46 study challenging mice starting at 10 days after the second dose reported no significant suppression of the Th2 recall response by OX40L-blocking reagents. Therefore, it is possible that study protocols with longer prechallenge periods would result in even stronger downregulation of Th2-associated parameters. Alternatively, a combination approach with another agent targeting a different stage in the Th2 pathway could have a synergistic protective effect.47 The systematic characterization of siRNA tropism and in vivo activity as described here, together with recent advances in optimal modifications for improved in vivo potency, can pave the way for the development of newer siRNAs as inhaled reagents for human therapy.48",
