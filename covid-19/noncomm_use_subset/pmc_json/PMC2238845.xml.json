About 15 million (>25%) of 57 million annual deaths are estimated to be related directly to infectious diseases (1). Newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases constitute an urgent and ongoing threat to public health throughout the world. The discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has led to renewed appreciation of the consequences of the emergence of infectious diseases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China in 2002 and has had a profound impact on public health (2). Influenza viruses possess evolutionary agility and the capacity to jump between fowl, farm animal and human species (3). Just as troubling are chronic infections, which create persistent social and economic havoc. Recent studies have shown that the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with certain infectious diseases falls primarily on infants and young children (4), with long-term social and economic consequences.",

Biomarkers, molecules that can be sensitively measured in the human body, are by definition potentially diagnostic. The efficacy of biomarkers to infectious diseases lies in their capability to provide early detection, establish highly specific diagnosis, determine accurate prognosis, direct molecular-based therapy and monitor disease progression (5). They are increasingly important in both therapeutic and diagnostic processes, with high potential to guide preventive interventions. Vast resources have been devoted to identifying and developing biomarkers that can help determine the treatments for patients. Furthermore, there is growing consensus that multiple markers will be required for most diagnoses, while single markers may serve in only selected cases. Despite intensified interest and research, however, the rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling (6), suggesting that a resource that leverages existing data is overdue. At present the databases containing information about biomarkers are focused predominantly on cancer: early detection research network (7), gastric cancer knowledgebase (8), integrated cancer biomarker information system (9) and database for cancer, asthma and autism for children's study (10). Even here, although 15\u201320% of cancers are linked to infectious diseases and chronic infection causes cancer (11), no systematic effort has been described for integrating information from the cancer biomarker and the infectious disease domains.",

It was designed to collect, store and display information about biomarkers, conjoined to research tools for sequence and structural analyses of the data. IDBD currently includes information on 611 biomarkers from 66 infectious diseases and 70 pathogens (Table 1). Biomarkers were classified according to detection, diagnosis, pathogen typing and virulence factor for clinical or epidemiological studies and application. Validated biomarkers were regarded as representative markers for experimental verification such as detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases in the reference and specialized laboratories or in scientific literatures. Potential biomarkers were defined as those frequently cited in the context of detection and diagnosis of infectious disease in recently published research journals. The correct assignment of biomarker subtypes and the evaluation of potential or validated biomarkers critically depend on expert group in infectious disease research fields. The IDBD data are updated and modified on a regular basis by a curation team, composed of researchers at the Center for Infectious Diseases and the Center for Immunology and Pathology in the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) in Seoul. The content in IDBD is open and freely accessible to the general public, and IDBD is a part of the National Disease Biomarker Bank project, an integrated framework for identifying, collecting, distributing and managing of biomarkers, which is being developed at KNIH.\n",

In total, 10 disease subgroups contain 66 diseases (Table 1). Each disease at IDBD is characterized by a number of attributes such as general information, pathogen, infection, symptom, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Pathogens are grouped into bacteria, virus, fungi and parasite, currently comprising 70 pathogens of mostly bacteria and virus. Each pathogen is characterized by general information, disease, biomarker list and related infection. Validated and potential biomarker entries are divided into three categories of detection/diagnosis, pathogen typing and virulence factor, and users can then access the data according to these criteria (Figure 1A).\n",

On the result page (Figure 3A), the alignment can then be exported for phylogenetic tree construction. The sequence analysis also includes standard BLAST services (blastn and blastp) on external network connectivity (17), pairwise distance and synonymous\u2014non-synonymous ratio analysis. In the case of structure analysis, users may submit an amino acid sequence or multiple sequences aligned to a set of methods for secondary (PSA) and tertiary structure (Geno3d) prediction (18,19). The predicted tertiary structures can be modeled by using Jmol either with a PDB file or PDB ID, if available (Figure 3B).\n",

Recent concerns about bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases have led to a new focus on the development of biomarkers, and molecular diagnostics are growing fast in infectious diseases. Currently, there are 611 biomarkers in IDBD among which 239 are validated ones. The content of biomarkers in IDBD is expanding rapidly, and our goal is to collect a complete dataset of validated or potential biomarkers used in the detection of infectious diseases and to generate a knowledgebase that would be a valuable tool for users interested in the discovery of infectious disease biomarkers. The main challenge in the future is to keep IDBD up to date with the growing number of biomarkers experimentally verified and published in peer reviewed journals. We will thus implement text-mining support for database curation in the near future. Toward this goal, a network of biomarker expert groups at the Center for Infectious Diseases and the Center for Immunology and Pathology at KNIH and advisory committee outside KNIH has been formed to coordinate database management and validation of novel biomarkers.",

Epidemiological surveillance is key to control and monitor diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, rabies, etc. Since information on infectious agents is essential in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases, it is necessary to collect, analyze and publish the relevant information on a regional scale, to the benefit of the researchers studying infectious diseases as well as the public. New insights into innate immunity initiated by host\u2013pathogen interaction are changing the way we think about pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Different approaches are employed for the characterization of immune responses by evaluating the epitopes recognized by antigen-specific receptors of immune systems. We intend to construct additional tools useful for molecular immunological and etiological applications. IDBD will collect intrinsic epitope features, seasonal patterns of sequences and epitope responses to T and B cells, and develop software for epitope analysis and prediction.",
