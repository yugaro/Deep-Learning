Glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid) is chemically 3-O-(2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranuronosyl-\u03b1-D-glucopyranuronosyl)-3\u03b2-hydroxy-11-oxo-18\u03b2, 20\u03b2-olean-12-en-29-oic acid. Roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) are extensively used in herbal medicines to treat diseases such as phthisis, contagious hepatitis, bronchitis and ague [1] and are also used in the treatment of various ailments such as spleen, sore throat, bronchitis, liver, kidney and ulcers [2], [3], [4]. Liquorice extract is largely used in confectionery, as a masking agent or taste corrective in pharmaceutical formulations and also to improve the taste of beer. It has anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic, antihepatotoxic, antiulcer and antiviral properties [5], [6], [7]. Glycyrrhizin presents in the roots as potassium or calcium salt and its content varies from 2% to 15% depending on plant species, as well as geographic and climatic conditions of its habitat.",

The comparison of extraction values in 50% aqueous ethanol by CE at ambient temperature with extraction under USW and ASE in the same solvent exhibited no significant increase in the yield of glycyrrhizin. However, in acidic conditions (pH 0.22) a maximum of 3.00% of glycyrrhizin was extracted, whereas under basic conditions (pH 11.85) the extractive value was to the tune of 12.70% (Table 3). As G. glabra is one of the major plants used commercially, the ASE method with ammonium hydroxide is the most appropriate method of extraction. By this process the amount of extractable glycyrrhizin increases by more than 50% as compared to extraction by CE under similar conditions.",
