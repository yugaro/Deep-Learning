We found six calves with abomasal impaction and three with abomasal ulcers. It was difficult to identify the cause of diarrhea for the other calves because of the following reasons: 1) Insufficient fecal volume of the sample; 2) The fecal volume was sufficient, but the causative agent may be other than the 14 causal agents selected in the experimental design of this study. All individuals were not subjected to an autopsy, and it was difficult to clarify the cause. As we focused on the analysis of 14 causative agents, the other causative agents were not analyzed.",

It was reported that the peak time for the identification of rotavirus in diarrheal calves is from 0 to 2 weeks of age [40]. In a previous study, rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified in each of the four age groups of Australian dairy calves (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201321, and > 21 days), and the highest occurrence was reported in the age group of 5\u201314 days [1]. Coccidiosis, a disease commonly observed in young cattle (1\u20132 months to 1 year), is usually sporadic during the wet seasons of the year. Diarrhea due to Eimeria spp. was the most prevalent between 5 and 6 weeks of age in KNC (the mean age: 57 days old). Diarrhea due to Giardia was also most prevalent between 5 and 6 weeks of age (the mean age: 38.1 days old), and all diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. occurred between 2 and 10 weeks of age. Other studies have reported that the most prevalent age for diarrhea due to Eimeria spp. was 4.7 to 12 weeks [3], with a mean age of 55 days (median: 49 days old), in southern Germany [21]. The mean age of diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. was 46.5 days (median: 42 days old) in southern Germany [21], and the mean ages of diarrhea caused by Eimeria spp. and Giardia spp. in southern Germany were very similar to those reported in the present study.",

            "text": "A previous study conducted in the Gyeongnam province of Korea reported that the prevalence of diarrhea was 31.3% in spring, 28.5% in summer, 24.9% in fall, and 15.3% in winter [22]. In the present study, the prevalence of diarrhea was 46.3% in spring, 13.4% in summer, 7.9% in fall, and 32.3% in winter. Spring was the most dangerous season because the morbidity and mortality rates associated with diarrhea in diarrheal calves were the highest in this season. A previous study in south-west France reported that the month of birth was significantly associated with morbidity: The highest morbidity rates were observed in December and March, and the mortality rate was two times higher in December than in other months [6]. In the present study, the incidence of calf diarrhea increased in proportion to the number of calf births in spring. In summer and fall, the incidence of diarrhea decreased in proportion to the number of calf births. In winter, however, the ratio of diarrheal calves to calf births was doubled. As the number of calf births in spring is the highest, diarrhea occurs more frequently owing to changes in temperature and the increased chance of contact with causative agents of calf diarrhea. In winter, few calf births were reported, but the calves appeared to be more exposed to causative agents and diarrhea. These infections became more severe, owing to the decreased resistance of calves upon exposure to the cold weather. The reason underlying the increase in mortality and morbidity was associated with the rotaviral infection of calves. Rotavirus-associated mortality was the highest component (46.7%) of total mortality. This observation is consistent with the most frequent rotavirus infection within 1 week of age, especially in spring and winter. In general, viruses tend to be more stable during the cold season, presumably owing to low temperatures. The prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus was significantly different between seasons.",
