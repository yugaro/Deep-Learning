            "text": "Protein quality control (PQC) was initially described to reflect the fact that secreted proteins with various defects were unable to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specifically, defects in protein glycosylation, folding, or assembly or protein aggregation led to ER retention (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989). More recently, it has become appreciated that PQC operates throughout the eukaryotic secretory pathway to ensure that toxic or misfolded proteins do not accumulate (Arvan et al., 2002; Apaja et al., 2010). In turn, regulated protein degradative systems provide a means to fine tune wild-type protein levels and thus their activities. Therefore even folded and functional proteins may be destroyed if existing levels are toxic or do not match cellular needs. If PQC or the regulated protein degradation system is defective or if the PQC machinery fails to recognize an aberrant protein, one of many human diseases may result (Gestwicki and Garza, 2012; Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012).",

            "text": "As noted, secretory pathway PQC begins in the ER, and proteins that fail to pass this step can be destroyed by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD substrates are first recognized by molecular chaperones and chaperone-like lectins, which target them for ubiquitination (Aebi et al., 2010; Claessen et al., 2012; Hebert and Molinari, 2012). During ubiquitination, ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm and delivered to and degraded by the 26S proteasome (Mehnert et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). If the ERAD machinery is overwhelmed or if aberrant proteins accumulate, the unfolded protein response is induced, and in some cases misfolded species can escape and advance to the Golgi. In these circumstances, ERAD substrates are returned to the ER (Vashist et al., 2001; Haynes et al., 2002; Taxis et al., 2002), or in yeast a Golgi quality control system, which is absent in mammalian cells, recognizes and delivers substrates to the vacuole for degradation via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway (Chang and Fink, 1995; Hong et al., 1996; Spear and Ng, 2003; Wang and Ng, 2010; Coughlan et al., 2004). PQC mechanisms also exist at the plasma membrane, and in this case selected substrates are endocytosed and targeted to the lysosome (Huotari and Helenius, 2011). For example, the disease-associated \u0394F508 mutant form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ERAD substrate but is also less stable than wild-type CFTR when delivered to the plasma membrane by low-temperature correction. Genome- and protein-wide screens revealed a significant number of factors required for the disposal of \u0394F508 CFTR from the plasma membrane (Trzcinska-Daneluti et al., 2009; Okiyoneda et al., 2010), and for many substrates quality control at the plasma membrane also follows the MVB pathway (Jenness et al., 1997; Arvan et al., 2002; Apaja et al., 2010; Keener and Babst, 2013; Zhao et al., 2013). There are multiple mechanisms to ensure that unwanted secreted proteins are destroyed, but it is generally unclear how these systems cooperate and which pathway might be most important for the PQC of a given substrate.",

Like other inward-rectifying potassium channels, Kir2.1 is formed by the tetrameric assembly of identical subunits; each subunit has a potassium selectivity sequence, which is flanked by two transmembrane domains. The N- and C- termini form a large regulatory structure that surrounds the central pore (Schwalbe et al., 2002). Tetrameric Kir2 potassium channels function primarily in heart, skeletal muscle, and neurons and consist of five family members\u2014Kir2.1\u20132.4 and 2.6 (de Boer et al., 2010; Hibino et al., 2010). Kir2.1 is responsible for controlling membrane excitability in many cell types, especially in heart and skeletal muscle, and loss-of-function mutations in Kir2.1 result in Anderson\u2013Tawil syndrome (ATS-1), a disorder characterized by periodic paralysis, long QT ventricular arrhythmias, and skeletomuscular dysplasia (Plaster et al., 2001). Gain-of-function mutations in Kir2.1 lead to short QT syndrome, which can also cause cardiac arrhythmias (Priori et al., 2005). These cases illustrate the importance of maintaining proper Kir2.1 levels. However, the factors necessary to support Kir2.1 trafficking and stability have not been explored in significant detail\u2014hence our desire to identify these components using a systems-level approach.",

Maximal Kir2.1 degradation required the AAA-ATPase Cdc48, the ER-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10, and the cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1. Because Kir2.1 supports the growth of trk1\u0394trk2\u0394 yeast on low-potassium medium (Tang et al., 1995; Nakamura and Gaber, 1998), this system also provided a unique opportunity to identify the spectrum of PQC and trafficking factors necessary to maintain active Kir2.1 at the plasma membrane. Of interest, ERAD-requiring factors were absent from the list of yeast mutants that significantly improved growth on low potassium, suggesting that the level of functional Kir2.1 is not regulated by ERAD. In contrast, most endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components were isolated. These data indicate that the plasma membrane and Golgi quality control systems regulate Kir2.1 residence at the plasma membrane. Consistent with this hypothesis, ESCRT also regulated Kir2.1 residence at the plasma membrane in human cultured cells. Together our results provide the first genomic analysis of the myriad degradative systems that operate on a single protein.",

For example, an ATS-1 disease\u2013causing mutation in the channel, \u0394314-315, prevents channel trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane by virtue of its inability to associate with the AP-1 clathrin-associated adaptor (Ma et al., 2011). To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Kir2.1 biosynthetic trafficking and degradation pathways, we refined a yeast expression system. To this end, a doubly tagged (myc and hemagglutinin [HA]) version of Kir2.1 was expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter. Analysis of Kir2.1 localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy primarily showed a perinuclear staining that colocalized with the ER-resident chaperone Kar2 (BiP; Figure 1A). Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis indicated that a significant amount of Kir2.1 comigrated with Kar2 (Figure 1B, lanes 1\u20136). However, a fraction of Kir2.1 also comigrated with the plasma membrane protein Pma1 (lanes 9\u201311). These data suggest that whereas the majority of Kir2.1 is ER localized, a small pool advances to the plasma membrane. Thus the yeast expression system provides a model to explore PQC steps encountered by Kir2.1 as it travels through the secretory pathway.",

Further, the AAA-ATPase, Cdc48, which extracts ERAD substrates from the ER membrane and into the cytosol (Wolf and Stolz, 2012), was required for degradation, since Kir2.1 was completely stabilized in a temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc48-2, at a nonpermissive temperature (Figure 2B).

To investigate whether Kir2.1 was degraded in an Hrd1- and/or Doa10-dependent manner, we expressed Kir2.1 in hrd1\u0394, doa10\u0394, hrd1\u0394doa10\u0394, and HRD1DOA10 strains. We found that Kir2.1 was stabilized to a similar level when either HRD1 or DOA10 was deleted, and when the genes encoding both E3s were absent, the protein was further stabilized (Figure 3A). We next asked whether deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligases led to a decrease in Kir2.1 ubiquitination. Kir2.1 was immunoprecipitated from wild-type or hrd1\u0394doa10\u0394 yeast and ubiquitin levels were examined by immunoblotting. As anticipated, deleting HRD1 and DOA10 led to \u223c40% reduction in Kir2.1 ubiquitination (Figure 3, B and C). Also as anticipated, an analysis of Kir2.1 residence by density centrifugation (see earlier discussion) in the hrd1\u0394doa10\u0394 strain established that the protein accumulated primarily in the ER and to some extent in the Golgi; however, there was no significant increase in the plasma membrane pool, as defined by comigration with Pma1 (Supplemental Figure S1). Because Kir2.1 degradation is Ssa1 dependent (see earlier discussion), we anticipated the requirement for Doa10, which adds ubiquitin onto ERAD substrates with misfolded cytoplasmic domains, that is, ERAD-C substrates (Vashist and Ng, 2004; Carvalho et al., 2006; Denic et al., 2006). The more surprising Hrd1 dependence suggested that Kir2.1 folding defects are also recognized within the membrane (Sato et al., 2009). Thus the Kir2.1 folding lesions in yeast are complex.",

For these studies, we took advantage of the ability of Kir2.1 to rescue the growth of a yeast strain lacking the Trk1 and Trk2 potassium transporters (Tang et al., 1995; Nakamura and Gaber, 1998). A synthetic gene array (SGA) query strain was engineered in which TRK1 and TRK2 were deleted and Kir2.1 was expressed. In low-potassium medium, growth of the strain correlates with Kir2.1 activity (Tang et al., 1995; Nakamura and Gaber, 1998). Thus PQC factors can be identified in an SGA screen as mutants that enhance cell growth in a Kir2.1-dependent manner. We ultimately determined that expressing Kir2.1 from a TEF promoter on a centromeric plasmid (Supplemental Figure S2A) and then propagation on medium lacking potassium at pH 4 (Nakamura and Gaber, 1998) and 30\u00b0C (Supplemental Figure S2B) provided the optimal set of conditions to screen for genes that, when mutated, would augment growth on low potassium. As a control, we found that the residence of Kir2.1, as measured in sucrose gradient analyses as in Figure 1, was unaffected when cells were propagated at pH 4 (unpublished data).",

Added into this analysis were strains lacking genes that encode members of protein complexes (e.g., ESCRT; see later discussion) that featured prominently in the preliminary screen. The 95 strongest hits from this second-round screen were selected and ranked by measuring growth in liquid culture in 96-well plates. The ratio of the doubling time of a vector-only control strain to the same strain expressing Kir2.1 was calculated to produce a growth score. The analysis identified 54 deletion strains that reproducibly increased growth in a Kir2.1-dependent manner, each having a significantly higher growth score than the query strain containing the vector-only control (Figure 4B, Table 1, and Supplemental Table S1). To our surprise, genes required for ERAD were completely absent from this list, suggesting that the modest increase in growth when DOA10 was deleted (Supplemental Figure S2) was below our cutoff. Instead, nearly all of the identified genes are associated with secretory pathway function at or beyond the Golgi. For example, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (Vps38) that regulates carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting and interacts with the retromer complex represented the strongest hit (Kihara et al., 2001; Burda et al., 2002). Also prominent among the hits were a large number of ESCRT proteins (Did2, Vps36, Vps27, Vps22, Vps2, Vps23, Vps37, Mvb12, and Vta1).",

First, a VPS23-null strain (vps23\u0394) strain, which also lacked TRK1 and TRK2, was constructed, and after introduction of the Kir2.1 expression vector, the yeast were rescreened on low-potassium medium. Improved growth by Kir2.1 in the trk1\u0394trk2\u0394vps23\u0394 strain was quite prominent but was significantly decreased in a trk1\u0394trk2\u0394VPS23 background (Figure 5A). To confirm that rescue on low-potassium medium was associated with Kir2.1 activity, we created a well-characterized loss-of-function mutation in Kir2.1, replacing the potassium selectivity filter 144GYG146 sequence with 144AAA146 (Tinker et al., 1996). After the expression plasmid was introduced into cells, the inactive channel was unable to rescue growth, even though it was expressed at similar levels as wild-type Kir2.1 (Figure 5, A and B). To ensure that Kir2.1-mediated rescue was unaffected by the presence of embedded epitopes, we expressed an untagged form of Kir2.1 in trk1\u0394trk2\u0394 cells that restored growth on low-potassium medium to a similar extent as that observed for the doubly tagged Kir2.1 construct (Supplemental Figure S4).",

As expected, the mutant failed to rescue growth of trk1\u0394trk2\u0394 yeast on low potassium. Because the \u0394314-315 mutant protein was expressed at significantly lower levels than wild-type Kir2.1 (Figure 5, A and B), we then assessed whether the mutation targets the channel for proteasomal- or vacuolar-dependent degradation. MG132 stabilized Kir2.1\u0394314-315 in the pdr5\u0394 yeast strain, but degradation was unaffected when vacuolar proteases were inactivated (Supplemental Figure S5). These results reflect other observations that Kir2.1\u0394314-315 is stabilized when the proteasome is inhibited in HeLa cells (unpublished data; see later discussion). Together the data suggest either that defects in the progression of the Andersen\u2013Tawil mutant protein beyond the Golgi result in retrieval to the ER and proteasomal degradation, or the protein exhibits an ER folding defect as well as a defect in AP1-mediated trafficking.",

Further, leupeptin addition augmented colocalization with a late endosomal/lysosomal marker, CD63 (Figure 6E).

Treatments with targeted small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) led to nearly complete absence of Tsg101 and \u223c50% decrease in the amount of HRS (Figure 6, F and G). In parallel, there was a corresponding increase in Kir2.1 abundance (Figure 6H). Addition of leupeptin did not lead to a further increase in Kir2.1 when the ESCRT components were knocked down, consistent with delivery to and degradation of the channel in the lysosome (Figure 6I). Our collective data from the yeast and human cell models demonstrate that ESCRT-dependent targeting of Kir2.1 to the vacuole/lysosome regulates the levels of Kir2.1 at the plasma membrane.

An initial characterization of Kir2.1 in yeast revealed a majority of the channel residing in the ER, where it is targeted for ERAD. In contrast, our genomic screen revealed that the abundance of active Kir2.1 at the plasma membrane is controlled by vacuolar targeting factors. These data suggest that a larger, permanently misfolded population of Kir2.1 is delivered to the ERAD pathway, which may be unable to mature or become active. By contrast, the pool of Kir2.1 that migrates beyond the ER appears to be in a folding-competent state, in which it is regulated by ESCRT and associated factors (see later discussion). In one model, this population may transiently adopt misfolded conformations, and defects in ESCRT-mediated degradation could then rescue this protein pool so it functions at the plasma membrane. The notion of an unstable population of maturing and even functional ion transporters is not new (Hill and Cooper, 2000; Helliwell et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2007; Apaja et al., 2010), but our data represent the first hint of the relative strengths of unique quality control mechanisms that may act on a single protein in the secretory pathway.",

Kir2.1 is regulated by both ERAD and ESCRT-mediated lysosomal degradation, as in yeast, but the relative contribution of each is inverted. In yeast, the majority of Kir2.1 was degraded by ERAD, with a minor Kir2.1 population being targeted to the vacuole. Based on our calculations, rescue of trk1\u0394trk2\u0394 yeast growth requires very few active Kir2.1 channels on the surface, so the screen provides a sensitive method to detect this minor pool. Nevertheless, rapid ERAD-mediated turnover precluded our ability to reproducibly measure changes in Kir2.1 organellar residence in the mutant strains (unpublished data). In contrast, Kir2.1 is primarily degraded in the lysosome in HeLa cells, whereas a smaller population of Kir2.1 is targeted for ERAD, and based on this fact, significant changes in the intraorganellar pool were evident (Figure 6).",

Lipids such as cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-bisP) alter Kir2.1 function and may influence its stability (Huang et al., 1998; Romanenko et al., 2004). Yeast lack cholesterol (but contain ergosterol), and the levels of PI-4,5-bisP might differ significantly between yeast and human cells. In addition, yeast could lack a Kir2.1 cofactor, which stabilizes the protein. For example, a yeast screen was used to identify cofactors for a rodent monocarboxylate transporter that increased transporter levels and function (Makuc et al., 2004). It is unknown whether a Kir2.1 cofactor exists in mammals, but a yeast-based screen provides a route to identify this putative factor, as well as intragenic mutations that affect Kir2.1 function and PQC.",

ESCRT-I (Vps23, Vps37, and Mvb12 were represented in the screen) and ESCRT-II (Vps22 and Vps36 were isolated) are then recruited and confine cargo at the site of vesicle formation, which initiates vesicle invagination before ESCRT-III (e.g., Vps2, Table 1) is recruited (Teo et al., 2004, 2006; Gill et al., 2007; Kostelansky et al., 2007; Wollert and Hurley, 2010). Association of ESCRT-III leads to cargo deubiquitination (McCullough et al., 2006) and vesicle maturation (Wollert et al., 2009; Wollert and Hurley, 2010). In yeast the Vps4\u2013Vta1 complex (Vta1, Table 1) then aids in disassembly of the ESCRT complex to complete vesicle formation (Babst et al., 1998; Azmi et al., 2008).",

Deletion of VPS38, which encodes a component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex II (PI3KII), most strongly affected Kir2.1-dependent rescue. PI3K is a member of two complexes, PI3KI and PI3KII. PI3KI localizes primarily to the vacuole and is involved in autophagy, whereas PI3KII resides in the Golgi and endosome and regulates protein trafficking from the endosome to the Golgi (Burda et al., 2002; Obara et al., 2006). Deletion of the genes encoding Vps38 and another component of the PI3K complexes, Vps30, compromises retromer activity (Burda et al., 2002). Retromer functions in the recovery of proteins from the endosome to the Golgi (Seaman et al., 1998), and all five members of the retromer complex (Vps5, Vps17, Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35) are represented within the 20 strongest hits in the screen. Although the mechanism is undefined, deletion of retromer increases plasma membrane residence of other membrane proteins in yeast, flies, and worms (Kim et al., 2007; Korolchuk et al., 2007; Dang et al., 2011). More recently, the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK), which is involved in osteoclast formation, was shown to be inhibited by retromer-mediated transport from the endosome to the Golgi, thereby increasing RANK at the plasma membrane in murine osteoclasts (Xia et al., 2013). Inhibition of retromer may cause a factor that would normally antagonize Kir2.1 plasma membrane residence, such as a Golgi retention factor, to be degraded, or retromer may aid in retrieving a population of Kir2.1 that traffics through an endosomal intermediate en route to the plasma membrane.",

Ypt6 interacts with Vps52 in the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which retrieves proteins from the endosome to the Golgi; two GARP components were among the hits (Vps52 and Vps53; Conibear and Stevens, 2000; Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2002). Other protein complexes involved in trafficking within the Golgi, such as the TRAPP complex (Tca17, Trs85; Sacher et al., 2000; Montpetit and Conibear, 2009) and the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex (Cog5, Cog6, Cog7, Cog8; Ram et al., 2002; Ungar et al., 2002), were among the 18 weakest hits, but whether these play a direct or indirect role in Kir2.1 trafficking is unclear.

For each hit, we showed that the introduction of a vector control was unable to improve growth to the same level as a strain expressing Kir2.1. However, a screen for mutants that exhibited increased sensitivity to cationic drugs identified Arl1, the COG complex, the GARP complex, and retromer (Barreto et al., 2011), suggesting that some of hits from our screen may alter the localization of other yeast potassium channels in addition to Kir2.1. Many of our hits also lead to increased CPY secretion (Bonangelino et al., 2002). However, the strains that increase CPY secretion do not completely overlap with the hits identified in this study; thus Kir2.1 localization is regulated differently than this soluble, vacuolar-resident protein (see Supplemental Table S1). In fact, there is more overlap with genes identified in a screen for mutants that rescue the localization of a defective form of the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1 (e.g., Vps38, Vps36, Vps29, Vps13, Vps35, Vps27, and Bsd2; Luo and Chang, 1997). A screen was also performed in which another inward-rectifying potassium channel, Kir3.2, was mutated so that it was sodium selective, and strains expressing the protein were crossed to a subset of the deletion collection (Haass et al., 2007). The resulting haploids were screened on medium containing high sodium, and seven genes associated with COPII-dependent transport and lipid biogenesis were identified that, when mutated, reduced sodium-mediated toxicity.",

It is worthwhile to note that the population of an unrelated potassium channel, KCa3.1, at the plasma membrane is also regulated by ESCRT and that mutant forms of this channel are subject to ERAD (Balut et al., 2012). Therefore in the future it will be interesting to determine whether ESCRT is used for the targeted destruction of all or only a subset of potassium and perhaps other ion channels. In addition, we found that a core collection of Hsp70 and Hsp40 molecular chaperones aid in the identification of Kir2.1 as an ERAD substrate in the ER. Studies in mammalian cells identified Hsc70, Hsp90, and Hsp40s as important for the recognition of the CFTR mutant that resides at the plasma membrane (Okiyoneda et al., 2010). Future work will uncover whether these and other chaperones operate at multiple quality control networks for Kir2.1 and other ion transporters.",

Yeast harboring plasmids containing the MET25 promoter were maintained on medium containing 0.5 mM methionine to inhibit protein synthesis. To induce Kir2.1 expression, cells were grown to log phase in selective medium supplemented with methionine, collected by centrifugation and washed in sterile water, and then resuspended in selective medium lacking methionine for 1\u20132 h. After induction, cells were used as described for each experiment. For low-potassium growth assays and the SGA screen, 20 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) and the indicated concentration of potassium were added. Medium was also prepared at the desired pH with Tris-HCl. A complete list of the strains used in this study is presented in Supplemental Table S2.",

To create a yeast Kir2.1-HA expression construct with a C-terminal myc tag (myc-Kir2.1-HA), the Kir2.1 coding sequence within the pcDNA3.1 vector was PCR amplified using the PCR Master Mix reagent (Fermentas, Waltham, MA). The amplified Kir2.1 sequence was purified using the PureLink PCR purification kit (Invitrogen) and ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pGEM-T-Kir2.1 plasmids were sequenced to identify clones that contained the correct Kir2.1 insert. The insert was removed from pGEM-T using EcoRI, the fragment was gel purified using PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Invitrogen), and the isolated species was ligated into the EcoRI site of yeast plasmids containing either constitutive (TEF, GPD) or regulated (MET25) promoters (Mumberg et al., 1994, 1995). The myc-Kir2.1-HA insert was then cloned into digested pRS vectors containing different promoters and genes for auxotrophic selection (Mumberg et al., 1994, 1995) using SmaI and XhoI. The cut vector was treated with Antarctic phosphatase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), and the digested vectors were run on a 1% agarose gel and purified with PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Invitrogen). The cut vectors and inserts were finally ligated using T4 DNA Ligase (Fermentas). Kir2.1-AAA and Kir2.1\u0394314-315 were made by two-stage PCR mutagenesis (Vallejo et al., 1994).
