Thus, the pandemic potential of lethal H7N9 influenza has raised public concern.",

In fact, a surveillance study has suggested that the novel influenza A H7N9 virus is a new reassortant of several influenza viruses, including H7, N9, and H9N2.6 Therefore, development of universal influenza vaccines is an attractive goal for scientists around the world. In this regard, the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of influenza viruses may be a promising target for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. This is because M2e is relatively conserved in different subtypes of influenza virus,12,13 and animal experiments have demonstrated that M2e vaccination can provide cross-protection against infection with different subtypes of influenza virus. H5N1-M2e-specific antibodies could react with different subtypes of influenza virus, such as H5N2, H9N2, H7N7, and H11N6.14 Various M2e-based vaccines have been developed, such as recombinant protein vaccines,15,16,17,18 plasmid DNA vaccines,19 and peptide vaccines.20,21 In our previous studies, we constructed a tetrameric H5N1-M2e vaccine candidate and demonstrated that it could provide cross-protection against lethal infections with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses.20,21 In this study, we extend our investigation to evaluate cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection by the novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus in mice.",

To examine whether these variations would affect the reaction of the antibody induced by the H5N1-M2e vaccine and H7N9-M2e, we tested the antibody titers in serum samples collected from H5N1-M2e-vaccinated mice using ELISA with plates coated with H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e, respectively. The titers of immunoglobulin G antibody specific to H7N9-M2e (Figure 2A) and H5N1-M2e (Figure 2B) were gradually increased in mouse serum samples collected after each vaccination, reaching very high levels (>1:105) 10 days after the last booster vaccination. By contrast, M2e-specific antibody was undetectable in serum samples collected from mice vaccinated with FA, SAS, or PBS alone. The adjuvant effect of SAS seemed to be better than that of FA because H5N1-M2e plus SAS induced a higher level of antibody responses. Importantly, the antibody titers specific to H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e were similar (P > 0.05). These results indicate that H5N1-M2e vaccination induced a high level of M2e-specific antibody that effectively cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e, although a difference of approximately 21% (5/24) amino acids was identified between the sequences of H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e.",

The vaccinations thus protected the mice from a lethal challenge with the H7N9 virus (Figure 3). The survival rate of H5N1-M2e-vaccinated mice against a H7N9 lethal challenge was 80%, which was the same as that of H5N1-M2e-vaccinated mice against a H5N1 lethal challenge.20 Consistently, viral load and lung damage in H5N1-M2e-vaccinated mice were much lower and less severe than that in adjuvant- or PBS-injected mice (Figure 4). Although T-cell responses induced by an M2e-based vaccine have been reported previously, the protection by the M2e vaccination was mainly attributed to the induced antibodies but not the T cells.19 Similarly, our results showed that the cross-protection of the H5N1-M2e vaccination was directly related to the levels of cross-reactive antibodies toward the M2e of challenge viruses. Unlike vaccinations with inactivated viruses, HA-subunit vaccines and VLP vaccines, which may provide complete protection against infection by homogenous viruses but poor cross-protection against infection by heterogeneous viruses, our results illustrate that the H5N1-M2e tetrameric peptide vaccine can provide satisfactory cross-protection against infection with a novel influenza virus that has newly emerged in humans.",

            "text": "Amino acid mutations at positions 10 and 11 of M2e reduce the monoclonal antibody binding affinity,32 whereas virus mutants at M2e position 10 can escape the protection of M2e antibodies.33 Moreover, M2e peptide variants at positions 10, 14, and 16 significantly reduce reactive antibody-binding titer.19 These findings indicate that although M2e is relatively conserved among different subtypes of influenza virus, amino acid mutations at certain positions could indeed affect the efficacy of M2e vaccination. Notably, there are five amino acid differences at positions 13, 14, 18, 21, and 24 between H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e, which accounted for approximately 21% (5/24) of the total amino acids of M2e (Figure 1). However, these amino acid variations did not abolish the efficacy of the vaccination. The protection against lethal challenge by H7N9 virus (Figures 3 and 4) was not affected, despite the fact that the amino acid variations between H5N1-M2e and H7N9-M2e included a mutation at position 14, which has been reported to affect the antibody cross-reaction.19 To examine how the amino acid variations may affect the structure of the M2e peptide, the 3D structures of M2e-A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1), M2e-A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1), M2e-A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9), and M2e-A/Beijing/501/09 (H1N1) were analyzed using the online software PEP-FOLD (Figure 5). The 3D structures of M2e-A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1) and M2e-A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9) showed that the middle regions were similarly folded as an \u201copen\u201d structure, although there were five amino acid differences between these two M2e sequences (Figure 1). Although there was only one amino acid difference between M2e-A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1) and M2e-A/Beijing/501/09 (H1N1), the 3D structure of M2e-A/Beijing/501/09 (H1N1) showed a relatively more \u201copen\u201d structure (Figure 5). However, M2e-A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1), which contained amino acid variations at positions 10, 14, and 16 (Figure 1) and had low cross-reactivity with the H5N1-M2e-induced antibody (Figure 2C), had the same region folded as a hairpin structure. According to the 3D prediction model, the 12th amino acid, arginine, and the 15th amino acid, tryptophan, in the structure of M2e-A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) are bulky and are located at the top of the hairpin, which may provide steric hindrance that blocks the access to the lower region of the structure. This structure may limit the antibody-binding ability and the antigen processing by the immune system. By contrast, the 12th-position arginine and the 15th-position tryptophan of the other three M2e structures orientate in such a way that they would not block the lower access. These observations may explain why the H5N1-M2e vaccine-induced antibody could still react with M2e that contained variations at positions 13, 14, 18, 21, and 24, but it could not react with M2e containing amino acid variations at positions 10, 14, and 16, because their 3D structure were not compatible.",

These results suggest that the M2e tetrameric peptide may provide broad spectrum of cross-protection against infections by heterogeneous influenza viruses. The M2e tetrameric peptide may be a promising candidate for the development of a universal vaccine. To improve the vaccine's protection, the M2e vaccine may be used together with inactivated virus, HA-subunit and/or other types of vaccines. Complete protection has been reported in the combined use of an M2e-based vaccine and inactivated virus vaccine.37\n",
