The samples of abdominal and pleural effusions, whole blood, serum, rectal swabs, faeces and tissues were sent to our laboratory under\nrefrigeration.

The primers were used at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M. The\nS gene fragments were amplified to determine the FCoV serotype (I or II) in each animal. Amplification of the 3c and S genes, including\ncodons 1,058 and 1,060, via first-round PCR was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec; and final\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. In some cases, the 3c and S genes were amplified via nested RT-PCR, in which a second-round reaction was performed using the\nsame PCR cycle parameters. The S gene-based serotyping was carried out together with the 3c gene amplification under the same reaction protocol or\nseparately via single or nested RT-PCR, wherein the reaction protocol was the same except for a shortened extension time of 20 sec. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel\nand amplified DNA fragments were retrieved using the Wizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The extracted product was directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1\nCycle Sequencing Kit on a genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3130, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Some amplicons were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a\nTOPO\u00ae TA Cloning\u00ae Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced using M13 primers or the primers used for RT-PCR. The obtained 3c gene sequences were\nanalyzed to determine the types and locations of mutations via comparisons with type I FECV strains RM (FJ938051) and UU19 (HQ392470) and type II FIPV strain KUK-H/L (AB781789), none of\nwhich carry mutations resulting in the production of truncated proteins. GENETYX 13 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and BioEdit 7.1.3.0 [7] software were\nused for sequence analysis. All determined 3c gene sequences were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan.

Our present study revealed that type I FCoVs in ascites and pleural effusion samples had the M1,058L and S1,060A missense mutations at a rate of 80.0 and 13.3%,\nrespectively. Because histopathological examinations of the cats were not performed, the biotypes of FCoVs analyzed in this study could not be determined. Therefore, the relationship between\nthe biotypes and gene mutations was not analyzed. However, it is considered that approximately \u226590% FCoVs in effusion samples have one of the S gene mutations. On the\ncontrary, neither M1,058L nor S1,060A mutations were found in FCoVs in any of the 19 faecal samples from shelter cats, some of which had soft stools, indicating enteritis. A previous report\nindicated that none of the FECVs in rectal swabs carried a mutation at codon 1,058 or 1,060 [6]. Accordingly, it is suggested that majority FCoVs in\nfaeces of clinically healthy cats and cats with only mild enteritis carry the S genes without any of these mutations. The M1,058L mutation was also detected in faeces and\ntissues of four young diseased cats that had died. The biotype of the viruses was unknown, but faecal FCoVs with the M1,058L or S1,060A mutation would require experimental infection for\npathogenicity determination, even when FIP was confirmed via histopathological examination.",

Although\nthe precise molecular function of the 3c protein is unknown, it has been reported to play an essential role in FECV replication in the intestines [2,\n13]. Our present study determined that 87.5% FCoVs in body cavity effusions, which included type I and II viruses, and all type I FCoVs, in six tissues\ncollected from four cats, carried 3c gene mutations resulting in the truncation or loss of 3c protein. However, such mutations were not detected in the majority of faecal\nFCoVs of shelter cats that did not exhibit any clinical symptoms except for soft stools. This finding is similar to previously published data [3, 6]. Therefore, it is considered that in addition to the M1,058L and S1,060A mutations in the S gene, a truncating mutation of the\n3c gene is another genetic feature that is relatively characteristic of FCoVs in effusions and tissues. Molecular functional analysis of the 3c protein is required to\nelucidate the influence of the 3c gene mutation on the FCoVs.",
