We previously reported that HeLa cells and primary fibroblasts express high levels of IFITM3, which renders them refractory to infection by Zika virus (12). When HeLa were exposed to micromolar quantities of rapamycin for 4 h, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in IFITM3 protein as determined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 A\u2013C). The effect was selective because another transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor, was unaffected by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1C). A time course experiment revealed that IFITM3 down-regulation was both progressive, with maximal decreases observed at 4 to 6 h posttreatment, and transient, as IFITM3 protein levels partially recovered over time (Fig. 1 D and E). We also examined how mTOR inhibition affects endogenous IFITM3 induced by type I IFN in 293T cells. Following 24 h of IFN stimulation, rapamycin addition led to decreased levels of induced IFITM3 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Here, elevated amounts of rapamycin resulted in a stable, nontransient loss of induced IFITM3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A).",

            "text": "We used quantitative RT-PCR to show that IFITM3 mRNA levels were unaffected by rapamycin (Fig. 1F), indicating that the down-regulation of IFITM3 manifests at the protein level. A second mTOR inhibitor, Torin 1, which was also shown to enhance lentivector transduction in CD34+ HSPCs (38), down-regulated endogenous IFITM3 in the micromolar range as well (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). In agreement with a model of posttranslational regulation, we found that the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 partially prevented rapamycin-mediated down-regulation (Fig. 1 G and H), indicating that endolysosomal acidification contributes to IFITM3 protein degradation during mTOR inhibition. Meanwhile, an endosomal trafficking inhibitor that functions independently of acidification also partially rescued IFITM3 protein levels while the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effect (Fig. 1 G and H). To explore the mechanism of IFITM3 down-regulation in molecular detail, we studied the fate of exogenous IFITM3 stably transfected into 293T cells. While rapamycin treatment resulted in decreases to WT IFITM3 protein, a mutant variant in which the proline-based PPxY site recognized by NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase is disrupted (\u039417-18) (45) was partially resistant to down-regulation (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Similarly, a previously described ubiquitin-deficient variant of IFITM3 in which all lysines were changed to arginines (\u0394Lys) (46, 47) displayed a loss in sensitivity to rapamycin-mediated degradation. Furthermore, a mutant lacking both the NEDD4 recognition site and a critical tyrosine needed for AP2-mediated endocytosis (\u039417-20) (47\u201349) was completely resistant to the effects of rapamycin (Fig. 1I and SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). In the same experimental system, exogenous IFITM2 protein was as sensitive to rapamycin as IFITM3 while IFITM1 was resistant (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). The differential effect of rapamycin on closely related IFITM proteins can be explained by the fact that the NEDD4 recognition and endocytosis motifs, present in the amino termini of IFITM3 and IFITM2, are absent in IFITM1. Together, these data suggest that mTOR inhibitors redirect IFITM3 protein toward a proteolytic pathway that requires endocytosis, ubiquitination, and endolysosomal acidification. To confirm that mTOR inhibitor treatment decreases IFITM3 protein half-life, we treated HeLa cells with rapamycin in the presence of cycloheximide (Chx) for up to 4 h. Rapamycin accelerated IFITM3 protein turnover under these conditions while bafilomycin A1 inhibited the loss (Fig. 1J).",

            "text": "To elucidate the mechanism by which IFITM3 protein is targeted to endolysosomes for degradation, we studied the effects of rapamycin treatment in fixed cells using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) and HeLa cells, rapamycin treatment reduced IFITM3 levels in a bafilomycin A1-sensitive manner (Fig. 2A). In mock-treated cells, endogenous IFITM3 localized to early endosomes and, to a lesser extent, endolysosomes, as determined by costaining with EEA1 and LAMP1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). However, rapamycin treatment resulted in an abrupt clearance of IFITM3 from these sites without affecting levels of EEA1 or LAMP1 themselves (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B and C). Addition of both rapamycin and bafilomycin A1 led to retention of IFITM3 in reticulated, sac-like structures surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Endolysosomal enrichment of IFITM3 in this condition was confirmed using RFP-tagged LAMP1 in the TZM-bl cell line, which also expresses high levels of endogenous IFITM3 (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2D). To enable the tracking of IFITM3 in living cells, we included YFP-tagged IFITM3 in the analysis. Rapamycin treatment led to a redistribution of IFITM3-YFP to compartments positive for both LAMP1-RFP and Lysotracker reagent, further suggesting that the posttranslational degradation program terminates in acidic endolysosomes (Fig. 2C).",

            "text": "To resolve the mechanism by which IFITM3 is delivered to the proteolytic lumen of endolysosomes during mTOR inhibition, we considered the involvement of two cellular pathways: macroautophagy and MVB formation. Since rapamycin is commonly used to induce macroautophagy in cultured cells, we tested whether rapamycin-mediated IFITM3 degradation requires autophagosome formation. While concomitant treatment of cells with rapamycin and bafilomycin A1 resulted in IFITM3 accumulation in LAMP1-containing endolysosomes, these structures were generally not decorated with the autophagosomal marker LC3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D). To more directly assess the contribution of autophagy, we evaluated the effects of serum and amino acid deprivation. In TZM-bl and HFF cells, rapamycin treatment resulted in conversion of LC3-I to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes (50) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). The conversion to and subsequent loss of LC3-II is reflective of autophagic flux, and degradation can be inhibited by bafilomycin A1. While rapamycin promotes LC3 turnover, starvation of cells for the same duration as rapamycin treatment led to a greater loss of LC3 while affecting levels of IFITM3 to a lesser extent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D), suggesting that the two modes of mTOR inhibition differ in regard to the extent and rapidity by which IFITM3 is degraded. Furthermore, they indicate that degradation of LC3 and IFITM3 is uncoupled during mTOR inhibition, ruling out the possibility that they are both regulated by autophagosomes. To confirm the independence of IFITM3 degradation and autophagosomal processes, we tested whether rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3 could occur in autophagy-deficient cells (51). In ATG9a KO cells, in which the accumulation of LC3-II and its turnover are prevented, IFITM3 degradation was apparent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Together, these results suggest that mTOR inhibitors result in delivery of IFITM3 to endolysosomes in an autophagosome-independent manner. In contrast, knockdown of ESCRT-I component TSG101 partially prevented IFITM3 degradation by rapamycin, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D) and Western blot (Fig. 2E). Enhancement of the IFITM3 immunoblot revealed a covalent modification of approximately nine kilodaltons in rapamycin-treated, TSG101-depleted cells, which may represent a single ubiquitin moiety (Fig. 2F). The functional requirement for ESCRT machinery in the rapamycin-induced degradation of IFITM3 suggests that mTOR inhibition promotes the ubiquitination and sorting of IFITM3 into MVBs before disposal in lysosomes. This was supported by a strong association between IFITM3 and MVB marker CD63 in cells treated with rapamycin and bafilomycin A1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C).",

Relative to treatment with a nontargeting control siRNA, thorough silencing of Raptor had no effect on IFITM3 protein levels. In contrast, a slight reduction of Rictor resulted in decreases in IFITM3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 D and E). The specific, albeit modest, effect of Rictor knockdown suggests that mTORC2 inhibition may be the means by which rapamycin leads to IFITM3 degradation. A role for mTORC2 is consistent with previous observations indicating that rapamycin inhibits mTORC2-dependent activities, such as the phosphorylation of Akt and the suppression of cell proliferation, when used at micromolar concentrations (36).",

We also assessed the consequence of drug treatment on CD34+ cells from adult peripheral blood using confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, both IFITM2/3 and LAMP1 signals were elevated following addition of lentivector, suggesting that virus addition mobilizes endosomes in this primary cell type. As a result, assessment of endosomal proteins necessitated the addition of lentivector. As shown in cord blood CD34+ cells, rapamycin treatment of adult CD34+ cells led to a dose-dependent down-regulation of IFITM2/3 and redistribution to perinuclear sites (Fig. 3C).",

            "text": "While the preceding experiments collectively demonstrate that mTOR inhibition negatively regulates IFITM2 and IFITM3 in various cell types, it remained to be tested whether this phenomenon accounts for the rapamycin-mediated enhancement of lentiviral transduction reported previously in CD34+ HSPCs (52). To reproduce the conditions used in CD34+ HSPCs, HeLa cells were incubated with 20 micromolar rapamycin 4 h before and during lentivector exposure, and productive transduction was scored by de novo HIV-1 Gag expression. We found that rapamycin treatment of HeLa cells increased permissiveness to an HIV-1\u2013based lentivector bearing VSV-G by three- to fourfold (Fig. 4A), and partial knockdown of IFITM3 using shRNA resulted in transduction rates similar to those following drug treatment (Fig. 4 B and C). Importantly, rapamycin treatment in IFITM3 knockdown cells led to an even higher transduction rate, but the enhancing effect of the drug was relatively diminished (less than twofold) (Fig. 4C). This result suggested that the function of rapamycin as a transduction enhancer depends on levels of endogenous IFITM3. To fully suppress protein production of IFITM3, as well as IFITM2 and IFITM1, we targeted the three gene products with a mixture of siRNA as previously described (12, 18). In HeLa cells in which IFITM1-3 are silenced, the influence of rapamycin on transduction was absent (Fig. 4D). Since IFITM proteins are known to inhibit infection during virus\u2013cell fusion, we used a FRET-based assay to measure early steps of virus entry into cells (53). The results indicated that rapamycin enhances lentivector transduction in HeLa by promoting virus\u2013cell fusion, consistent with findings in CD34+ HSPCs (38) (Fig. 4E). Moreover, while depletion of IFITM1-3 led to increases in virus\u2013cell fusion, no further enhancement was observed with rapamycin (Fig. 4E). Therefore, rapamycin enhances virus\u2013cell fusion and does so, to a large extent, by down-regulating IFITM protein expression. Western blot analysis was used to establish the efficiency and specificity by which RNAi reagents down-regulated IFITM proteins in these experiments (Fig. 4 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A) and also provided evidence that endogenous IFITM2, in addition to IFITM3, is negatively regulated by rapamycin (Fig. 4F). We again detected the likely ubiquitinated form of IFITM3 in cells treated with both rapamycin and bafilomycin A1, and this form was absent in IFITM3-silenced cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). Combining rapamycin with RNAi in primary HFFs confirmed that the rapamycin-mediated lentiviral transduction enhancement requires IFITM proteins (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, by achieving a robust and specific gene knockout of IFITM3 using CRISPR-Cas9, we found that IFITM3 is the major determinant of rapamycin sensitivity in HeLa (Fig. 4I) and TZM-bl cells (Fig. 4J and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C\u2013E).",

            "text": "While IFITM3 functions broadly to inhibit many pathogenic RNA viruses in cell culture experiments, the physiological impact of IFITM3 is best characterized during IAV infection in mice and humans (32, 54). Consistent with its ability to coordinate the selective clearance of IFITM3 and IFITM2 from cells, we found that rapamycin also promotes infection by IAV in HeLa and HFFs in an IFITM-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A\u2013C). Relative to VSV-G\u2013mediated virus entry, IAV infection is more sensitive to inhibition by IFITM3, and rapamycin treatment led to a greater degree of infection enhancement (9- to 10-fold). Our silencing and knockout experiments indicated that IFITM3 expression is required for the observed enhancement of viral infections by rapamycin. To establish whether it is sufficient to confer rapamycin sensitivity to cells, we performed experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from ifitm-deficient mice (55, 56). IAV infection in cells lacking murine IFITM proteins was not significantly boosted by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5D). In contrast, complementation of cells with murine IFITM3 resulted in a more than 100-fold inhibition of infection, and this restriction was partially relieved following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5D). Analysis of protein levels in complemented cells revealed that murine IFITM3 is partially down-regulated by rapamycin and that levels are partially restored by the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that IFITM3 expression alone confers sensitivity to the rapamycin-mediated infection enhancement effect. Further solidifying the functional relationship between endogenous IFITM proteins and the effects of mTOR inhibition on virus infections is the finding that Sendai virus, a paramyxovirus, is resistant to the effects of both rapamycin treatment and IFITM silencing (Fig. 5F). That is, neither rapamycin treatment nor IFITM knockdown led to an enhancement of Sendai virus infection. Therefore, rapamycin enhances infection by IFITM-sensitive viruses, but not IFITM-resistant viruses, demonstrating that the primary mechanism by which mTOR inhibition promotes infection is down-modulation of IFITM3 protein.",

While it is possible that IFITM3 belongs to a suite of proteins subject to regulation by mTOR inhibition, we show that certain other endosomal proteins (transferrin receptor, LAMP1, and EEA1) are spared during this process.

IFITM3 was the dominant source of restriction in cells assessed here, but the relative abundance of IFITM proteins may vary by tissue and by the microenvironmental cues present therein. In addition to enhancing infections mediated by VSV-G and IAV HA, it is likely that mTOR inhibition promotes infection by a number of other viruses pathogenic to humans. Of particular interest is the impact on HIV-1, which is sensitive to IFITM-mediated restriction at early stages (entry) and late stages (virion infectivity) of its life cycle in a strain-dependent manner (17, 18, 20, 58, 59). Furthermore, drugs and conditions that lead to mTOR inhibition are expected to impact other cellular processes in which IFITM2 and IFITM3 are involved, such as cell\u2013cell adhesion and cytokine regulation (25). Indeed, further studies into these effects may reveal the physiological basis for the interconnectedness of mTOR and IFITM proteins.",

These latter findings reveal how IFITM3 inhibits IFN signaling and cell migration, respectively, and provide examples of how IFITM proteins influence immunity in many ways. Nonetheless, our results suggest that IFITM3 is not a substrate regulated by macroautophagy itself, at least not in the contexts explored in this study.

By recognizing a tyrosine-based motif (PPxY) in the amino terminus, NEDD4 was shown to ubiquitinate and accelerate the turnover of IFITM3 in human and murine cells (45). NEDD4 is known to ubiquitinate cargo proteins sorted by ESCRT (63\u201365). We did not explicitly rule in a role for NEDD4 in the rapamycin-mediated degradation of IFITM3, but partial escape from the effects of mTOR inhibition were displayed by mutant IFITM3 lacking the PPxY motif or lacking lysine residues previously shown to be targeted for ubiquitination. However, since NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases including ITCH also recognize the PPxY motif in the protein substrates they regulate (66, 67), IFITM3 turnover may be controlled by multiple E3 ligases. Our results using TSG101 depletion link IFITM proteins with the ESCRT machinery. It remains to be seen whether ESCRT governs the relative amounts and localization of IFITM3 during basal homeostasis or during cellular stresses other than mTOR inhibition.",

Consistent with a role for MVBs, when degradation is interrupted with bafilomycin A1, IFITM3 accumulates in multivesicular sac-like structures. To arrive at this transient compartment, ESCRT may coordinate the sorting of IFITM3 from late endosomal and/or lysosomal membranes into membrane invaginations known as ILVs (5, 68). Fusion between MVB and terminal lysosomes at perinuclear sites, which is bafilomycin A1-sensitive (69), may facilitate the transfer of IFITM3-containing ILVs into the lysosomal lumen for degradation by hydrolases. Of note, ILVs are also released from cells when MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane in a process known as exocytosis (4, 70). Since IFITM3 protein is regularly detected in virus particles and extracellular vesicles when expressed at high levels in cells (17, 71), it is possible that mTOR inhibition augments the pool of IFITM3 ejected into the extracellular space.",

In fact, while initially believed to undergo virus\u2013cell fusion in early endosomes, evidence exists that VSV-G uses a back-fusion step in the MVB to complete cytoplasmic entry (72). Thus, together with the well-characterized low pH trigger required for IAV HA-mediated fusion, both viral glycoproteins utilized in this study display a dependence on late endosomal/MVB membranes. Most previous studies employing overexpression of IFITM3 have documented an endolysosomal expression pattern in cells, suggesting that subcellular localization underlies its ability to restrict viruses entering at these sites (73, 74). However, we observed that endogenous IFITM3 localizes mainly to early endosomes in HeLa cells. It is possible that virus restriction occurs as IFITM3 and internalized virus particles overlap in trafficking endosomes maturing toward a late phenotype. Furthermore, virus infection driven by VSV-G is less sensitive to restriction by IFITM3 relative to IAV HA (27, 75), which may reflect differential dependence on late endosomal/MVB membranes for entry or qualitatively different interactions with said membranes. The insensitivity of Sendai virus to both IFITM proteins and rapamycin treatment is likely attributed to its ability to fuse at the plasma membrane (63). It will be worthwhile to assess how virus infection or IFN signaling impacts IFITM3 abundance in different endosomal compartments.",

            "text": "The data presented herein provide a mechanistic understanding of how rapamycin facilitates lentiviral transduction in cells ex vivo, but they also raise important questions regarding their uses in vivo. Pharmacologic mTOR inhibition is currently being used to inhibit metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, aging, graft rejection, and tumorigenesis, and certain applications have already received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (76). However, by limiting IFITM2 and IFITM3 levels in endosomes, exposure to rapamycin may undermine an important component of cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. Indeed, humans immunocompromised by mTOR inhibitors during cancer treatment or following organ transplant exhibit increased incidence of respiratory tract infections, including those caused by viruses such as IAV (77\u201380). Furthermore, administration of rapamycin in vivo shortly after infection with IAV led to exacerbated disease and mortality in mice (81). In humans, a naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in decreased IFITM3 mRNA expression is associated with severe outcomes following IAV infection (54). That reduced IFITM3 expression can have physiological impact highlights the need for further investigation into the molecular players that link IFITM3 to the mTOR pathway. Our work suggests that the complex responsible for regulating IFITM3 is mTORC2 since the silencing of Rictor alone led to detectable decreases in IFITM3 protein. However, the transient nature of IFITM3 down-regulation following mTOR inhibition and the existence of feedback loops imply that genetic approaches to identify the genes responsible will be challenging. It would be beneficial to determine whether and how caloric restriction, like exposure to rapamycin, influences the expression of IFITM3 and modulates vulnerability to virus infection.",
