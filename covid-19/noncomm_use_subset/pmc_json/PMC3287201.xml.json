            "text": "Uniquely among RNA viruses, however, current evidence suggests that at least two RdRp activities are encoded by the genomes of members of the coronavirus (CoV) family, the +RNA virus group that infects a wide range of vertebrates and is renowned for its exceptionally large polycistronic genome of \u223c30 kilobases (6). Both CoV RdRps belong to the set of 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that are produced through proteolytic processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase precursor polyproteins, which both derive from translation of the genomic RNA (7,8). For the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2003 and caused worldwide concern due to the \u223c10% mortality rate associated with infection of humans (6,9), the two replicase subunits with RdRp activity have been studied in some detail. The first is the 106-kDa nsp12, which contains the canonical viral RdRp motifs in its C-terminal part and employs a primer-dependent initiation mechanism (10,11). The second polymerase, the 22-kDa nsp8, is unique for CoVs and was reported to be only capable of de novo RNA synthesis with a low fidelity on ssRNA templates (12). Together, these observations inspired a hypothesis in which nsp8 would serve as an RNA primase, i.e. would synthesise short oligonucleotide primers for subsequent extension by the nsp12 \u2018main RdRp\u2019 (12).",

For instance, it is unclear whether the homomeric form of nsp8, for which in vitro RdRp activity was previously documented (12), actually occurs in vivo, as nsp8 was also shown to co-crystallize and form a unique hexadecameric ring-structure with the 10-kDa nsp7 subunit that resides immediately upstream in the replicase polyprotein precursors (Figure 1) (13). In a similar fashion, it is presently unknown whether the postulated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding channel of this complex plays a role in the RdRp activity of nsp8 and whether this activity is influenced by nsp7, particularly given the observed low fidelity and low processivity of nsp8 (12).\n",

This technical refinement was found to greatly improve nsp8's ability to associate with nsp7. Moreover, and in contrast to previous observations (12), exposure of the natural N-terminus proved crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex on partially double-stranded RNA templates, demonstrating that nsp(7+8) is capable of primer-dependent RdRp activity as well. Site-directed mutagenesis of nsp8 in the context of the nsp(7+8) complex identified a conserved D/ExD/E motif that is important for catalysis in vitro, possibly providing a first indication of the location of the presently unknown nsp8 active site. Overall, these results define the SARS-CoV nsp(7+8) complex as an intriguing multimeric RNA polymerase that is capable of primer extension.",

The primers used were SAV704 and SAV429 (Supplementary Table S1). For nsp8 expression, the sequence encoding pp1a residues 3920 to 4117 was amplified by RT-PCR using SAV428 and SAV429 as primers (Supplementary Table S1). Both PCR products were digested with SacII and BamHI, and ligated into expression vector pASK3-Ub-CHis6 (10). This vector was originally derived from the pET26-Ub-CHis6 vector (14), but drives expression of N-terminally ubiquitin-tagged and C-terminally His6-tagged fusion proteins via a tetracyclin-inducible promoter, to rule out the potential T7 polymerase contaminations that are known to cause false positive results when using T7 promoter-driven systems for recombinant RdRp expression.

Based on the large diameter, positive charge of the hexadecamer's channel and in silico docking, it was proposed to be able to encircle dsRNA (Figure 1B). However, the functional significance of the compound interactions between nsp7 and nsp8 is poorly understood, as are the polymerase activities associated with monomeric nsp8 or nsp8-containing multimers. So far, strategies for the purification of recombinant nsp8 have involved the use of affinity tags [e.g. His6 or glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (12,13)] that were fused to one terminus to facilitate protein recovery. Inadvertently though, such tags or other exogenous sequences may significantly impede the correct folding of enzymes and thus alter their stability or activity, as exemplified by studies of the poliovirus (3Dpol) and SARS-CoV (nsp12) RdRp subunits (10,14,18). To circumvent this issue, we developed a protocol in which SARS-CoV nsp8 was expressed as a ubiquitin (ub) fusion protein carrying a C-terminal His6-tag (ub-nsp8-His), which was subsequently processed at both termini in two steps. The first step was co-translational and involved the release of the N-terminal ub fusion partner by the co-expressed ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Upb1, Figure 2A) (10,14). The second proteolytic step, catalysed by a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV nsp5 main protease (15), removed the C-terminal His6-tag and was performed either in solution (Figure 2A and B) or when nsp8-His was immobilised to Talon beads. This procedure yielded SARS-CoV nsp8 with its exact natural N- and C-terminus (replicase residues Ala-3920 and Gln-4117, respectively; Figure 2A), the product that is normally liberated by the nsp5-driven autoprocessing of the SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins (19).\n",

A comprehensive analysis of the influence of nsp7 on nsp8-dependent RNA binding required an nsp8 mutant that was incapable of RNA binding. To this end, we engineered an alanine substitution of the conserved residue K58, which resides in nsp8's proposed dsRNA-binding channel [residues 55\u201378 (13)]. As is evident from the electromobility shift assay in Figure 3B, this mutation was sufficient to significantly disrupt RNA binding. As a control, we also performed an aspartate-to-alanine substitution at position 52, which is partially conserved, yet not expected to participate in RNA backbone binding due to its negative charge and position just outside the proposed RNA binding channel. Indeed, the D52A mutation only induced a migratory shift of the dominant RNP signal towards the anode, likely as a result of the lost negative charge (Figure 3C).\n",

We used a fixed concentration of nsp7 and added either wild-type or mutant nsp8 up to the point where the nsp7:nsp8 ratio reached equimolarity. No RNA binding was observed in the absence of nsp8, but upon nsp(7+8) complex formation the amount of bound dsRNA rapidly increased (Figure 3D). Indicative of successful complex formation, we also observed a shift in the molecular weight of the major RNP complex formed (Figure 3D). Western blot analysis confirmed that both nsp7 and nsp8 were present at this position in the gel (not shown), but due to the generally unpredictable migration behaviour of proteins and RNPs in native PAGE, it was not possible to assess whether this band indeed corresponded to the nsp(7+8) hexadecamer. The Kd of the nsp(7+8) complex was estimated at \u223c1.2 \u03bcM, about 3-fold lower than that of nsp8 alone (Figure 3F).",

To verify that the full-length and longer RNA products were derived from single nsp(7+8) complexes bound to the template (i.e. from a processive activity), and not from multiple binding and extension events (i.e. a distributive activity), we performed the primer extension reaction in the presence of heparin to trap any unbound nsp(7+8). We first tested the concentration required to saturate all nsp(7+8) complexes in the reaction by titrating 0\u2013100 \u00b5M into the reaction (Supplementary Figure S2A) and observed that the incorporation levels were stable above 1 \u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting that these reactions represent single initiation\u2013extension events. We next assessed whether the activity of nsp8 or nsp(7+8) was distributive or processive by quantifying the incorporated signal in full-length or longer products in the presence of 1 \u00b5M heparin (Figure 4C). As shown in Figure 4D, 66 \u00b1 4% (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of the nsp8 products were full length compared to 61 \u00b1 2% of the nsp(7+8) products, suggesting that both the enzymes complexes are mostly processive and that nsp7 does not confer additional processivity to nsp8. Interestingly, both nsp8 and nsp(7+8) are able to extend the RNA primers beyond template length in the presence of heparin (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting that these extensions result from terminal transferase activity and not from template switching, as was previously observed for poliovirus 3Dpol (20).",

We first tested RNA-binding mutant K58A (Figure 2) at varying concentrations and observed a \u223c95% loss of nucleotide incorporation activity compared to the wild-type protein (Figure 5). Other likely candidates for a direct role in RdRp catalysis generally are Mg2+-coordinating aspartate residues and lysine or histidine residues that can function as general acid (3). In canonical RNA polymerases, the aspartates commonly reside in motifs A and C (3,21), while in DNA-dependent RNA primases they are usually found in a central D/ExD/E motif (22). Given the absence of classical RdRp A and C motifs in the nsp8 sequence (12), we screened an alignment of CoV nsp8 sequences for conserved D/ExD/E motifs. Interestingly, we found such a motif in both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domain (Figure 5A). Subsequent alanine substitution of the N-terminal D/ExD/E motif, composed of D50 and D52 in SARS-CoV, greatly affected primer extension activity on the CU10 template as shown in Figure 5C. Mutation of the downstream domain (residues D161 and D163 in SARS-CoV), however, had a much smaller effect on polymerase activity, suggesting that this C-terminal D/ExD/E motif is not critical for catalysis. Controls included mutant K58A and a mutant carrying a lysine-to-alanine substitution of the non-conserved residue 127. In line with the observation of the U20 template and its conservation in CoVs, the loss of a lysine at position 58 resulted in a near complete loss of RdRp activity, whereas mutation of K127 positively influenced RNA synthesis (Figure 5).\n",

To investigate whether this difference could be attributed to complex formation with nsp7 or the removal of the affinity tag, we performed the primer extension assay with three different recombinant nsp8 versions of which the gel filtration analysis is documented in Figure 2. Interestingly, for all three variants primer-extension activity was observed (Figure 7A), but the activity was most pronounced for nsp8-His and the untagged nsp8 (Figure 7A). To estimate the effect of nsp7 on the nsp8-driven primer extension activity, we performed a direct comparison of the two enzyme complexes and found that the activity of nsp8 alone was >2-fold lower than when nsp7 and nsp8 were present at equal molarity in the reaction (Figures 4D and 7B). A similar comparison was performed for the de novo activity of nsp8, using the assay published by Imbert et al. (12) and taking the first dinucleotide (pppGpA) product as readout. Interestingly, both nsp8 and nsp(7+8) synthesized equal amounts of the pppGpA dinucleotide (Figure 7C), suggesting that the effect of nsp8 is limited to the primer-extension activity of nsp8. In addition, we observed that the de novo initiation activity of nsp8 was \u223c2-fold higher than that of His-nsp8 (Figure 7D).\n",

To test if this inhibitory effect was His6-tag specific, we assessed the activity of a ub-nsp8-His fusion protein. At the same time, control reactions were performed in which we (i) followed the activity of this protein as it was being processed by a recombinant form of the ubiquitin-cleaving nsp2 protease of equine arteritis virus (28) or (ii) monitored the activity of nsp8-His. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, the presence of the ub-tag decreased nsp8 activity to a level that was comparable to that of N-terminally His6-tagged nsp8. Upon cleavage by EAV nsp2, however, a partial recovery of the primer extension activity was observed (Supplementary Figure S3). Unfortunately, we were not able to perform the same experiment with purified ub-nsp8, since our recombinant nsp5 removed the N-terminal ub-tag with similar efficiency as the C-terminal His6-tag (Supplementary Figure S4).",

This would constitute a form of regulation of viral enzyme activity that is not without precedent, since also the poliovirus 3Dpol is inactive as long as it is fused to the 3C protease in the 3CD precursor (29). To verify this hypothesis, we expressed nsp7-8-His and tested this protein for RdRp activity. Interestingly, this fusion protein, a potential intermediate of CoV replicase polyprotein processing and a multimer in solution (Figure 7E), showed primer extension activities that were comparable to or higher than the activity of nsp(7+8-His) (Figure 7F). The de novo initiation activity of nsp7-8-His was, however, \u223c2-fold lower than the activity of nsp8 and nsp(7+8) (Figure 7D). In conclusion, this result clearly underlines that the two N-terminal fusion partners other than nsp7 are specifically detrimental to SARS-CoV nsp8 primer-dependent RdRp activity in vitro. It also demonstrates that nsp8 alone may be sufficient to act as a primase.",

Significant for our understanding of CoV RNA synthesis, we find that this complex is capable of binding dsRNA molecules and extending partially double-stranded RNA templates. This activity is therefore essentially comparable to the activity reported for the nsp12-RdRp (10).",

Firstly, we note that in the published nsp(7+8) crystal structure four of the eight N-terminal D/ExD/E motifs in the complex reside at the border of partially unresolved N-terminal nsp8 domains, where the coordinates of up to 49 nsp8 residues and 5 exogenous amino acids derived from the removed GST fusion partner were not determined. In light of our own finding that unnatural N-terminal extensions severely impair nsp8's RdRp activity (Figure 5), this suggests that the published crystal structure may not represent an active conformation of the nsp(7+8) polymerase. Secondly, we observe that residues D50 and D52, which are both crucial for nsp(7+8) activity, are residing in an \u03b1-helix in the nsp(7+8) structure (Supplementary Figure S5), whereas in canonical primases and polymerases, the catalytic centre is preferentially located on \u03b2-strands or turns (12,22). Thirdly, we note that Mg2+ was lacking from the published nsp(7+8) crystal structure (13), even though it is required for nsp(7+8) activity. Fourthly and last, we observe that a 1:1 ratio of nsp7:nsp8 is sufficient to capture all nsp8 in a higher molecular weight complex (Figure 2F) whereas previously a 2:1 ratio was required (13), potentially due to the additional N-terminal residues that altered the dynamics of complex formation.",

In addition, our experiments and controls revealed and address a number of disparities between previous claims and hypotheses (12), and our own observations. The \u2018primase hypothesis\u2019 previously formulated by Imbert and co-workers (12) remains an intriguing model to explain the initiation of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis and is a topic that will be addressed in detail elsewhere. Nevertheless, based on the primer extension activity of nsp(7+8) on non-structured RNA templates, we can no longer exclude the possibility that nsp(7+8) may synthesise substantially longer products than mere oligonucleotide primers in vivo, possibly stimulated by the presence of additional viral protein factors that could e.g. provide RNA-unwinding activity. Consequently, it is now a distinct possibility that CoV RNA synthesis involves structurally different and functionally separable RNA synthesising complexes [e.g. containing nsp12 or nsp(7+8)], each possessing their own dedicated RdRp characteristics and function in viral plus or minus strand RNA synthesis. It will therefore be crucial to study whether these different polymerase activities are part of the same enzyme complex and, if so, whether they can influence each other's activity or are subject to additional control mechanisms.",

(A) To test the influence of magnesium ions on nsp(7+8) activity, we performed nsp(7+8) primer extension reactions at 0\u201310 mM Mg2+. (B) Quantification of the results presented in Figure 6A, presented as the amount of NTP incorporated per \u03bcM nsp8 monomer. Error bars represent standard deviations (n = 3). (C) The influence of the pH on nsp(7+8) activity was tested for a pH range of 6\u201311. A clear optimum was observed around 9.5. (D) Quantification of the results in Figure 6C, presented as the amount of NTP incorporated per \u03bcM nsp8 monomer. Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 3). (E) Schematic presentation of the pulse-chase experiment that was used to test the nsp(7+8) nucleotide incorporation specificity on a primed poly(U) template (see Table 1). The reactions were initiated with a limiting concentration of [\u03b1-32P]ATP to allow the formation of a stable polymerase-template complex. Unlabelled nucleotides were used at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM. (F) SARS-CoV nsp(7+8) allowed only limited transversional and transitional mutations. Use of manganese ions as cofactor for polymerase activity resulted in a minor, though noticeable loss of fidelity. Lane 1 represents the input signal to which no unlabelled nucleotides were added. Nucleoside triphosphates are abbreviated to single letters (i.e. A for ATP, G for GTP, U for UTP, C for CTP and R for RTP).",

Samples were taken at the indicated time points and checked for [\u03b1-32P]AMP incorporation by 20% PAGE/7 M urea analysis. (B) Side-by-side comparison of the primer-extension activities of nps8 and nsp(7+8). Shorter incubations are shown to better demonstrate the difference in activity. (C) De novo activity of nsp8 and nsp(7+8) on template AFMB131 (see Table 1), using the synthesis of the first dinucleotide pppGpA, as previously described by Imbert et al. (12), as readout. Nsp8 template binding mutant K58A was used as negative control. The AMP contaminant present in the used [\u03b1-32P]ATP label is marked as loading control and size reference.
