The N-terminus is basic with positive charge, while the C-terminus is acidic with negative charge.

This result is consistent with the conserved domains that we have predicted by using CDS (Conserved Domain Search). A highly conserved domain (FYYLGTGP at Codons 111-118) was identified within the first conserved region in all coronaviruses. These conserved regions and domains could serve as potential drug targets because of their great possibility of performing critical functions.

Therefore, we used SR as a marker to identify this region, though amino acid change may occur in SR and cause marker to disappear. We classified all SR-rich regions of coronavirus N proteins into a few types (Table 2), and discovered that the classification of those coronaviruses by their core motifs of the SR-rich region was consistent with the phylogenic tree that we had constructed. It seems that the SR-rich region is typically common and representative, though it is outside the conserved regions and has easily-varied sequence.",

By targeting RNA recombination, Ding, et al. found that the SR-rich region could not be transferred from MHV to BCoV (bovine coronavirus), which means that this region was unable to be substituted between various species (6). It is believed that the SR-rich region is possibly derived from the SR (or RS) domain of many RNA-binding proteins, such as SR proteins (6). The SR proteins are essential for constitutive mRNA splicing and the regulation of alternative splice site selection (8). The C-terminal SR domain of SR proteins is involved in mediating protein-protein interaction as well as nuclear localization 8., 9.. The SR-rich region might be necessary for the interaction of the N and M proteins. It also possibly contributes to the interaction of the N protein with other viral proteins, including the N protein itself.",

The comparison of both results demonstrates that the percentage of strongly positive results in the N protein (64%) is significantly higher than that in the S protein (28%). One of the explanations might be that the N protein is the most abundant protein produced throughout infection, because its template mRNA is the smallest and it has the most abundant sgRNA (subgenome RNA) during transcription (2).

Based on multi-alignment of totally nineteen coronavirus N proteins, two conserved regions were found around a.a. 81-140 and a.a. 270-320 (amino acid positions are all referred to the N protein of SARS-CoV, Isolate BJ01). The arrow indicates the most conserved domain, and its sequence and amino acid position are given. In contrast, the two termini of the N protein are more variable, particularly the C- terminal. The figure was generated by Plotcon in the EMBOSS package (http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/).",
