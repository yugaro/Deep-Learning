This research was conducted by independent researchers with participants well-placed to provide insights into the management of the outbreak. The lessons learnt from this work are:The outbreak was perceived to be serious and caused by inadequate readiness of the facility to implement infection prevention control guidelines effectively.Management of the outbreak was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement IC measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety.Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and teamwork and harnessing collective leadership.Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.\n",

Interviews were audio-recorded via a digital device with data transcribed immediately after data collection. Each interview/group lasted between 45 and 100 min; transcripts included non-verbal behaviour.

The organisation was perceived to be acutely and chronically slow in responding to the outbreak. For example, organisational responses from management to the outbreak was perceived to be relatively slow compared with the rapid speed with which the infection spread. Moreover, despite references to high management transparency, some staff cited that poor staff orientation and management ambiguity contributed to staff being isolated and unclear about the decisions and measures being adopted by senior management to promote IC. This perceived poor communication created additional confusion that led to low coordination of IC instructions from bothIC and the nursing teams. Consequently, some health professionals, and other administrative and military staff, did not even appreciate the severity of the outbreak. Their consequent lack of attention to reducing the number of new patients and visitors entering the institution was seen to further elevate infection risk.",

This negative coverage contributed to significantly negative public perceptions of the Ministry, KAMC-R, its senior decision-makers and the frontline HCWs. These negative commentaries were evident across local mass media (television, radio and newspapers) and social media - particularly Twitter. The negative media reporting was cited as negatively impacting staff morale and affecting workers socially, psychologically, and mentally. During this challenging period, this compounded the negative effects of work demands. Reactive and poor media management by the KAMC-R was seen to contribute to the ongoing frequency and negativity of this commentary. Participants suggested that the institution should have a media centre to coordinate media coverage in such emergency circumstances (table 2).",

As with other studies,32 while independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by perceived \u2018official\u2019 links between the project and the organisation. Staff perspectives may have also been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed (around 8 months).

Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and team work and fostering collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, as well as better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.",
