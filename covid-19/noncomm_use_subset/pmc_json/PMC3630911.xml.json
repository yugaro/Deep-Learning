This outbreak clearly indicated that emerging microbes and infections are one of the most important issues for global health and economy. Global collaboration on emerging microbes is inevitable, and of urgent need.",

Research regarding virology, immunology, epidemiology clinical medicine, laboratory diagnosis and bioinformatics on this newly discovered horrifying virus and infection were discussed. With no traffic, no crowd, no interference from outside, it was quiet but hot inside the meeting room, as scientists eagerly discussed the progress already made and possible fields for future collaboration. This meeting was very productive. It led to several important and impressive articles being published and some new technologies developed for rapid diagnosis and control of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it rejuvenated and strengthened worldwide collaboration on microbes and infections that had already existed for a long time before the SARS-CoV episode.",

Notably, clinicians and epidemiologists provided important information on emerging infections, despite not being able to identify the microbes themselves. Microbiologists have then been able to identify the agents, and by employing bioinformatics, structural and functional genomic analysis, measures to diagnose, treat and prevent newly discovered diseases were developed. Publications of articles markedly helped to distribute new information worldwide, for the benefit of mankind.",

In addition, with scientists from different fields and countries on the editorial board, this journal will serve as a bridge between researchers, clinicians and epidemiologists in the developing and the developed world. In order to update readers of Emerging Microbes and Infections, there will not only be reviews and articles, but also a section on news and views. We encourage authors to submit new findings or new trends in microbes and infections to this journal, for timely and worldwide distribution. For authors with interesting news or findings from the developing world, we will provide editing help and reduce or waive publication payment.",
