The virus was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia (Saudi MoH, 2014a, Saudi MoH, 2014b, Zaki et al., 2012). While there are several corona viruses that infect different species of animals, only two strains have been found to infect humans: (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (CDC, 2014, de Groot et al., 2013, Chan et al., 2013, M\u00fcller et al., 2012, Meyer et al., 2015). More than 1626 cases of MERS have been detected in 26 countries all over the world. Since 2012 WHO have notified 586 deaths due to MERS-CoV. However, 85% of reported cases were identified in Saudi Arabia, mostly in the cities of Riyadh and Jeddah (Coronamap, 2014). According to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health, 768 cases have been identified in Saudi Arabia since 2012, 328 of these being fatalities (Saudi MoH, 2014a, Saudi MoH, 2014b).",

The study was able to detect an identical genomic sequence of isolated MERS-CoV in both deceased humans and infected camels in Saudi Arabia (Azhar et al., 2014). An epidemiological investigation of this study indicated close contact between infected humans and infected camels. Given that several investigations have offered compelling evidence of the association between exposure to camels and the increased risk of acquiring MERS-CoV, precautionary measures were advised for individuals working in close contact with camels such as farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. People were warned to take care when handling raw camel products such as milk and meat and advice issued to prevent cross-contamination of infected products with other food items (WHO, 2014).",
