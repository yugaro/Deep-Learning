In the age-group (\u22652, <5), Adv predominated with 37 out of 147 samples (25.2%), followed by HRV (29/147, 19.7%), RSV (16/147, 16.9%), coronavirus (all types), and influenza (A and B), (14/147, 9.5%) each, Hmpv (12/147, 8.2%) and PIV (1, 2, and 3), 9 (6.1%).

Influenza predominated in the age-group (\u226510, <18), with 4/22 samples (18.2%), while in the remaining 3 age-groups (\u226518), HRV was the commonest isolated pathogen 33/286 (11.5%), followed by Influenza with 20/286 (7%) (influenza A H1-2009, 11/20). The frequency of each pathogen in each respective age-group has been displayed in Figure 1. There was a statistically significant difference between all age groups, for HRV (P < .001), Adv (P < .001), influenza (ALL) (P = .02), RSV (P = .002), PIV-3 (P = .04), and coronavirus (ALL) (P = .02). Based on Figure 1, it is obvious that HRV prevailed in all age groups, but especially in the groups (<2) and (\u22655, <10). Among Adv positive samples, there was a significant difference between the age group (\u22652, <5) (most cases, 37/83 or 44.6%) and (\u226545, <65) (no case) (P = .001), while most of the RSV positive samples (26/36, 72.2%) were noticed in ages under 5 years old. In regard with samples positive for influenza (A or B), the predominance of influenza in the age group (\u226510, <18) was due to influenza B cases, while the majority of cases with influenza A H1-2009 were noticed in the ages under 10 years old (16/27, 59.3%). The latter was also true for Hmpv (27/39, 69.2%), while PIV-3, the main PIV type detected (Table 1) had a peak incidence in ages under 5 years old (15/19, 78.9%). Finally, most cases of coronavirus (all types included) were detected in children <10 years old (28 out of 35 cases, 80%), 10 of which (28.6%) were in children (<2), with 2 types of coronavirus being detected in a single sample.",

In a study of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age, the FA-RP identified multiple co-infections (39%) with 2, 3, 4, and up to 5 different viruses.[29] Co-infection has also been found in 31%,[13] 36%,[9] 37%,[10] 42%,[30] and 51.8%[31] of positive respiratory samples. In our study, 9% of all our respiratory patients had multiple pathogens and 16% of all positive respiratory patients (almost 1 of 6 positive samples appeared with co-detections). There is no obvious explanation about the significance of lower frequency of co-detection in our series of patients. However, the predominance of HRV in our single and multiple detections is in accordance with previously published data.[32] Moreover, HRV/Adv and HRV/RSV combinations have been previously mentioned as the most frequent co-infection patterns.[30,33] Interestingly, it has been suggested that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of rhinovirus infection, but that, if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms.[34] Regarding the age-related distribution of multiple pathogens, our observation that patients under 5 years of age were more likely to have multiple detections, is almost in accordance with the eliminated previously published data.[33,35\u201337] Nevertheless, Tramuto et al have also noticed that most of their patients with multiple etiology were adults and elderly.[24]",
