She was diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, and discharged from the local nursing station. Over the next 24 h, she developed cough and fever that led to progressive vomiting, diarrhea and increased work of breathing, causing significant oxygen requirements, which led her to be transferred to a tertiary care centre. On admission, she required intubation and fluid resuscitation for respiratory failure and hypotension. On physical examination, she was afebrile. On respiratory examination, there were diffuse crackles and coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were normal. The only remaining rash consisted of vesicular lesions on an erythematous base on the sole of the right foot.",

The rest of the complete blood cell count, liver enzyme levels, renal function and electrolytes were normal. Blood and endotracheal tube aspirate cultures, obtained before vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered, were negative. Urine analysis revealed no leukocytes or nitrites; however, urine culture was positive for pansusceptible Escherichia coli (2\u00d7106 CFU/L). Cerebrospinal fluid obtained one day after admission, when her hemodynamic status improved, revealed a total white blood cell count of 28\u00d7106 cells/L, including 66% lymphocytes, 8% neutrophils, 26% monocytes, glucose 5 mmol/L, protein 0.21 g/L and a few red blood cells observed on microscopy. Bacterial cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for enterovirus and herpes simplex virus were negative. Stool sent for electron microscopy was negative, but stool for viral culture was pending. Chest x-ray revealed a right middle-lobe infiltration. A nasopharyngeal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage sent for respiratory virus panel PCR, which included adenovirus, human coronavirus OC43, 229E and NL63, repiratory syncytial virus A and B, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, enterovirus, rhinovirus A, B and C, bocavirus 1 and 2, and human metapneumovirus, were both negative. Acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, bacterial culture and fungal culture from the bronchoalveolar lavage were negative. The patient became unable to move her upper extremities on day 2 of admission. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine was performed on the same day, and revealed restricted diffusion at the dorsal brain stem and patchy areas of prolonged signal intensity involving the cranial-cervical junction, cervical and, to a lesser extent, the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, suggestive of transverse myelitis with rhomboencephalitis.",

The first cases in Canada reported to the National Centre for Enteroviruses occurred in 1994, including eight cases from Quebec. From 1990 to 2013, EV-A71 was the 10th most prevalent EV serotype, not including rhinovirus, detected within Canada in samples submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML, Winnipeg, Manitoba) (2). A combination of active (stool samples for all cases of acute flaccid paralysis) and passive (EV genotyping) samples are used by the NML. Between Jaunary 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011, 0.9% of 941 specimens positive for EV submitted to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory were positive for EV-A71 according to viral culture (3). Another 20 cases of EV-A71 in one tertiary care pediatric centre were reported in 1998 (4).",

Therefore, PCR has become the standard diagnostic test. Interestingly with the present case, PCR was negative, while the culture successfully led to this virus being detected. Negative PCR and positive viral culture for EV is a rare finding, occurring a few times per year, at most, based on previous experience at the Manitoba Provincial Public Health Laboratory.",

Two hundred eighty-two cases of EV-D68 were confirmed between July 2014 and October 31, 2014, in samples submitted to the Canadian NML (2). In comparison, from 1994 to 2013, only 101 cases of EV-A71 were identified at the NML (2).
