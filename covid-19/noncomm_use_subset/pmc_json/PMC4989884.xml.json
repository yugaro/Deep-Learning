            "text": "Novel human viral pathogens are emerging with increasing frequency, however the mechanisms of viral adaptation to a new host are not well understood (Morse, et al. 2012; Anthony et al. 2013). The majority of these pathogens have an animal reservoir and an RNA genome. RNA viruses have a highly error-prone polymerase used for genome replication, and individual RNA genomes within a species generally differ by many nucleotides (nts) from the consensus (average) genome sequence. Because of this, the term \u2018quasispecies\u2019 is often used to describe the mutant spectra of viral genomes that constitute an RNA viral species (Domingo and Holland 1997). Recent studies indicate that intra-host viral population diversity may be a prerequisite for a virulent infection (Vignuzzi, et al. 2006; Kuss, Etheredge, and Pfeiffer, 2008; Guti\u00e9rrez, Michalakis, and Blanc 2012) although the nature of the infection (acute versus chronic) and viral lifecycle (i.e. vector-borne viruses) also influence the role of intra-host viral diversity in infection outcome (Weaver, Rico-Hesse, and Scott 1992; Jerzak, et al. 2007; Andersen et al. 2015).",

For example, passage of the SARS virus in rats generated a viral variant with a point mutation in the spike protein, and this mutation increased the efficiency of interaction of the spike protein and the viral receptor on the rat cells (Nagata, et al. 2007). Interestingly, data from this same study showed that both host and viral factors are associated with increased virulence, as virulence was associated with increased age of the rodent as well as mutations in the viral genome.",

            "text": "The precise mechanism(s) by which in vivo passage leads to increased virulence are not clear and may differ between viral families, genera, and even species. In vivo passage outcome is shaped by numerous factors including viral strain, genotypic diversity, size of the inoculum, route of exposure, and by host factors such as onset and strength of immune response (Kuss, Etheredge, and Pfeiffer, 2008; Guti\u00e9rrez, Michalakis, and Blanc 2012; Morelli, et al. 2013). Decreased immunocompetence may allow infecting viruses to cause prolonged infections which may increase the size and depth of genetic diversity present in the intra-host population of RNA viruses (Domingo 1997). Immunocompetence of a host is determined by many factors such as age, pregnancy, and nutrient intake (Levander 1997; Beck, Levander, and Handy 2003; Beck 2007). Recent studies by Beck and others suggest that both malnutrition and obesity adversely affect the ability of a host to mount a robust innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections (Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004; Zaki, Akuta, and Akaike 2005; Karlsson and Beck 2009). For example, obese mice infected with influenza virus had a significantly higher mortality and increased lung pathology as compared with lean mice (Smith et al. 2007). Similarly, infection of selenium deficient mice with an avirulent strain of Coxsackievirus B3 resulted in evolution of the virus into a virulent form that caused cardiac inflammation in both selenium deficient mice and normal control mice (Beck et al. 1995; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003).",

            "text": "Host nutritional status may influence the generation of variant viruses and thus the viral genotype by a number of mechanisms. Both selenium and vitamin E are antioxidants and function to control oxidative stress that is induced as part of the host response to infection. Although production of reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide may play a role in microbial clearance, it may also act as a mutagen and therefore may expand the diversity of the mutant spectra by acting on the fidelity of the viral polymerases (Domingo 1997; Akaike et al. 2000). The effect of oxidative stress on viral evolution has been demonstrated in a variety of viruses (influenza, coxsackie, polio, Sendai, and human immunodeficiency virus) and hosts (mouse, human) (Akaike et al. 2000; Beck et al. 2001; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003; Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004). Selenium deficiency has also been shown to impair the cellular and humoral immune response. Similarly, obesity leads to increased oxidative stress and immune dysregulation although through a different mechanism driven by chronic inflammation (Monteiro and Azevedo 2010; Kanneganti and Dixit 2012; Aroor and DeMarco 2014). In particular, obesity has been shown to reduce cytokine production and NK cell cytotoxicity (Akaike et al. 2000; Beck et al. 2001; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003; Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004; Smith et al. 2007). The presence of excess dietary iron, which has a pro-oxidant effect in vivo, may also increase viral titer and virulence (Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004).",

The HN protein of human parainfluenza 3 virus (hPIV3) was identified as the closest Protein Data Bank (PDB) structural template for the modeling. It was experimentally solved at the resolution of 1.65 angstroms (\u00c5) (PDB entry: 4MZA) (Xu et al. 2013), and the level of sequence identity between HN from Sendai and hPIV3 is 55%. Examples of other identified structural homologs that were leveraged during the modeling process include: HN from Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) (PDB entry: 1E8U; resolution: 2.00 \u00c5; sequence identity: 27%) (Connaris et al. 2002), HN from Simian virus 5 (Sv5) (4JF7; 2.50 \u00c5; 24%) (Welch et al. 2013), Nipah virus (NiV) (3D11; 2.31; 22%), Hendra virus (HeV) (2VSK; 2.00; 20%), Measles virus (MeV) (2ZB6; 2.60; 16%). Using available templates a set of initial structural models was created. To assess regions of sequence-structure conservation or variability in the modeled Sendai HN protein an extensive search for similar fragments in other proteins from PDB was performed using the StralSV algorithm (Zemla et al. 2011), which identifies protein fragments that exhibit structural similarities despite low primary amino acid sequence similarity. Results from these searches were used for modeling of missing loop or termini regions in the constructed preliminary models. For the construction of the final structural model the coordinates from the PDB chain 4mza_B were used as a primary template. The conformation of side-chain atoms was predicted using SCWRL (Krivov, Shapovalov, and Dunbrack 2009) when residue-residue correspondences did not match. Residues that were identical in the template and HN protein were copied from the template onto the model. The structural and stereochemical quality of the model was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in the MolProbity software package (Chen et al. 2010), and the final constructed model was finished with relaxation using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004).",

Many different combinations of primers were used in order to amplify as much of the viral genome as possible (Supplementary Table S1). To determine if the poor PCR amplification results were due to low numbers of viral genomes present in each sample, viral titers were determined by both plaque assay and Taqman PCR. The average number of positive PCR results per region (best possible score is two primers per region) was compared with the viral titer (PFU/ml) and to the Ct (cycle threshold) average of two replicates. The average Ct had a negative correlation with positive PCR results (r = \u22120.97), however there was no correlation between PCR outcome and viral titer as determined by plaque assay (r = \u22120.35). Number of viral genomes per PCR reaction was estimated using standard curve derived from control SeV plasmid dilutions and values ranged from \u223c800 genomes (sample SD4.P10, PCR score of 0) per PCR reaction to 25 million genomes (FD2.P10, PCR score of 2).

The presence of Lys at 461 rather than Glu is known to decrease HN neuraminidase activity without affecting binding of the HN protein to the cell receptor. For example, experiments described by Takahashi, Ryan, and Portner (1992) showed that while HN protein of SeV is heat-stable with Lys at 461, it becomes heat-labile when substitutions (Gly or Gln) occur at this position. Position 461 is also associated with virulence in mice, and mutates from a negatively charged residue, Glu, to a non-polar residue, Gly, in response to passage of an egg-propagated isolate in mouse cells (Kiyotani et al. 2001; Itoh et al. 1992).

Our data obtained from Sanger sequencing of clone isolates of the lab-adapted strain 52 showed a trend of G to A mutation for nt site 20 as egg-passaged seed virus was passaged serially in mice. In fact, there was an increase in the percentage of clones from P10 having an A as compared with P1 (17% of the clones from P1 had an A, whereas by P10 an A was detected in 48% of clones). Analysis of about eight clones per sample revealed that most samples (6/11) had a mixture of nts at nt 20. However, all of the 85 clones that were sequenced in this study had an A at nt 24. Thus, our data confirm the variability of nt site 20 as described by Fujii et al. and illustrate how consensus sequence data alone may hide the complexities of the viral population diversity.",

Based on structural modeling we conclude the following characteristics of identified mutation positions: (1) they are located on the surface, but should not interfere with critical functional regions such as the sialic acid-binding site, interfaces of HN tetramer formations, and interfaces within F-HN complex (Fig. 8). (2) These positions are in regions of high sequence variability among strains, serotypes or other related viruses. (3) Position 525 is located in the structurally variable region, while the two other positions, 454 and 461, can be considered as structurally conserved on the backbone level among number of closely related viruses. (4) Observations suggest that these positions are not involved in some critical function of the protein where conservation in both structure and sequence would be expected but they may play an important role to help virus adjustment to particular conditions or escape immune response. For example, results from the antigenic sites predictions on HN proteins characterize the region 451\u2013464 (overlapping with two of our mutation positions) as an epitope with good scores 0.6 and 0.4 by BepiPred and BEOracle prediction algorithms, respectively (Larsen, Lund, and Nielsen 2006; Wang et al. 2011).",

Although limited sequencing data were available from these animals, no changes were observed that differentiated FD.GP samples or the FD.P10 from the corresponding samples from the ND and SD groups. However, the combination of amino acids (residues 454, 461, 525) at these three sites is unique for FD.GP1 (the only FD.GP with sequence data for the HN gene). FD.GP1 had HN genotype AKQ (residues 454, 461, 525, respectively), as compared with genotypes AEK and VKQ for the ND.GP and SD.GP samples. Thus, it is possible that it is the unique combination of AKQ that attenuates the virus in guinea pigs. Alternatively other parameters such as temporal aspects of host response may have affected histopathology scores. For example, obesity may result in a delayed pro-inflammatory response to influenza virus infection (Smith et al. 2007), if this response is also delayed in Sendai infected animals, this may have resulted in decreased histopathology scores in the FD group (Fig. 2C).",

These studies have primarily focused on malnutrition of the host; however, more recent studies have begun to look at the role obesity plays in infection and immunity (Nieman et al. 1999; Ritz and Gardner 2006; Kanneganti and Dixit 2012). In this study, we focused on the role malnutrition (in the form of selenium deficiency) and diet induced obesity had in mice infected with SeV to understand the effects these two dietary conditions have on the viral mutant spectra and infection dynamics. Diet-induced obesity has been demonstrated to alter cytokine profiles in mice (Mito et al. 2000). Consistent with those studies, our studies found altered cytokine profiles in uninfected FD mice compared with SD and ND mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). In SeV-infected mice there were no differences found in cytokine expression profiles associated with in vivo passage within dietary groups; however, further analysis of cytokine profiles between the dietary groups found SD mice infected with SeV had a suppressed immune response compared with ND and FD mice infected with SeV (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, mice infected with influenza virus receiving a selenium deficient diet have been shown to have suppressed cytokine profiles compared with mice receiving a ND (Beck et al. 2001).",

It is likely that humans and animals swap viruses on a regular basis, with the vast majority of these transmission events going undetected. When these host jumps are detected it is hard to predict the likelihood that this new virus is capable of causing significant disease in the human population. Deep sequencing of viral populations provides important genetic information at a high level of resolution (Wanget al. 2007; Fishman and Branch 2009; Borucki et al. 2013; Morelli, et al. 2013; Andersen, et al. 2015) thus allowing detection of subconsensus mutations that may influence the infection outcome. Additionally, data from this study provide further evidence for the role of host nutritional status in the evolution of viral genotype and phenotype (Beck et al. 2001; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003; Beck 2007; Smith et al. 2007; Karlsson, Sheridan, and Beck 2010), and indicate that these changes may impact cross-species transmission events. In-depth data analysis, for both the viral population genotypes and the host response, is likely to be critical for understanding the mechanisms of viral host jumps and the role of the viral mutant spectra in vaccine efficacy and reversion.",
