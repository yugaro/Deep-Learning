We hypothesised that chemical inhibitors of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could modulate the survival and death of virus-infected cells. We studied the effect of the anticancer agent ABT-263 on the survival of non-cancerous human macrophages in response to IAV infection.18, 19 Cells were treated with ABT-263, infected with IAV or mock, and cell survival was monitored at the indicated times. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, ABT-263 accelerated the death of IAV-infected cells (Figure 1a). The cell death was dependent on the dose of ABT-263 and on the multiplicity of the viral infection (Figures 1b and c). Interestingly, ABT-263 treatment only slightly attenuated the production of infectious virus particles (Figure 1d). Thus, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, anticancer ABT-263 sensitises non-cancerous cells to IAV-induced death.",

We found that the structural analogues of ABT-263, ABT-737 and ABT-199 accelerated the death of IAV-infected human macrophages. By contrast, two other Bcl-xL-, Bcl-2- and Bcl-w-inhibitors \u2013 gossypol and TW-37 \u2013 were ineffective in the sensitisation of cells to IAV-induced death (Figure 2a; Supplementary Figure 1). The effect of ABT-263 was not restricted to a specific macrophage preparation, cell line or IAV strain (Figures 2b and c). Furthermore, ABT-263 accelerated the death of various cell types infected with influenza B (Orthomyxoviridae), Bunyamwera (Bunyaviridae), Semliki Forest and Sindbis (Togaviridae), Herpes Simplex 1 and 2 (Herpesviridae), Vaccinia (Poxiviridae), Measles (Paramyxoviridae), echovirus 6 (Picornaviridae), but not with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes (Herpesviridae), Tick-borne encephalitis and dengue viruses (Flaviviridae) (Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggest that ABT-263 and its structural analogues sensitise cells to virus-mediated killing and confirmed that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w are essential for cell survival upon viral infection.",

We found that obatoclax and saliphenylhalamide, but not gemcitabine, rescued IAV-infected ABT-263-treated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from death (Figures 3a\u2013c). Second, we performed a time-of-compound-addition experiment, which demonstrated that ABT-263 killed IAV-infected RPE cells independently of the time of its addition (Figure 3d). These results indicate that ABT-263 sensitises cells to death at multiple stages of IAV infection following virus endocytic uptake.",

Our immunofluorescence experiment showed \u2013 and immuno-precipitation (IP) experiment confirmed \u2013 that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, ABT-263 displaced Bad from Bcl-xL and the mitochondria, and the IAV facilitated this process (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

Bcl-xL interactions with pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) such as LRRFIP2, H2B and DHX9 indicate that Bcl-xL is potentially involved in sensing viral nucleic acids, and Bcl-xL interactions with FLII, TOLLIP and LRRFIP2 indicate that it could be also involved in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling cascade. Thus, we identify novel interacting partners for Bcl-xL, and possibly Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, which are specific but not limited to human non-cancerous RPE cells.",

An SDS-PAGE analysis of immuno-precipitated Bcl-xL-interacting proteins demonstrated the differences in the protein compositions of IPs (Figure 5b). Mass spectrometry, followed by an immonoblot analysis of protein candidates, showed that ABT-263, in combination with IAV, displaced UACA and Bax from Bcl-xL, in addition to Bad (Figures 5a and b).

Based on our results, we propose a mechanism of compound action in virus-infected non-cancerous cells (Figure 8). In our model, ABT-263, ABT-199 and ABT-737 bind Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w and deactivate these cellular \u2018fuses' by altering their interactions with pro-apoptotic Bad, Bax and UACA in virus-infected cells. Bax and Bad dissociation from the \u2018fuses' mediate the release of apoptogenic molecules, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c forms complexes with \u2018Bcl-xL-free' UACA, APAF1 and pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 becomes activated in this complex, empowering it to activate caspase-3 and -7 which, in turn, activates caspase-8. Caspase-8 is also activated through a virus-induced FADD-mediated apoptosis pathway. Active caspase-8 cleaves Bid, and the cleaved Bid accelerates the mitochondrial caspase-9-mediated apoptosis pathway. Thus, the mutual amplification of caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7 results in a dramatic increase of the quantity and repertoire of proteolysed vital cell proteins, which potentiate the transition of the apoptotic process to the execution \u2018no return' phase of cell demise.",

Based on the estimated model parameters, quantitative responses were calculated and expressed as DSS values. DSS summarises the area under the dose\u2013response curve over the entire dose range relative to the total area between 10% of the threshold and 100% of the inhibition. Further, to favour on-target responses over off-target responses, the integrated response was divided by the logarithm of the bottom asymptote of the logistic model. To assess the selective response of a compound to a virus-induced cell death, a differential DSS was calculated by subtracting the mock control DSS (no virus) from the viral DSS.",
