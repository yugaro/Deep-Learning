A nearly identical virus was then isolated from a second Saudi Arabian patient with respiratory disease who had been flown to London for therapy. In retrospect, the first cases of MERS occurred in an extended family in Zarqa, Jordan, in April 2012. Virus was detected in two patients in that outbreak, but several other family members and health care workers developed respiratory disease. Virus was not isolated from these individuals. Renal failure was noted in some of the early reports, but it is not yet clear whether it was virus induced or occurred as a consequence of respiratory failure. Since those early days, several other clusters of infection have been identified, indicating that human-to-human transmission occurred, although spread may not be efficient (2). The incubation time for patients with confirmed disease was 5.2 days (confidence interval, 1.9 to 14.7 days), according to one study (3).",

Diabetes mellitus (74%), end-stage renal disease (52%), and lung disease (43%) were underlying illnesses in these patients. Transmission to family members and health care workers was documented in 1 to 2% of contacts, again demonstrating preferential infection of individuals with substantial comorbidities. Unlike another human respiratory coronavirus, the one that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003, MERS-CoV has not preferentially infected health care workers. At present, it is not known if patients are able to transmit virus before the development of symptomatic respiratory disease. If this does occur, control of a large outbreak will be more difficult. The SARS epidemic was contained, in part, because the majority of patients were infectious only after they developed pneumonia.",

Careful epidemiological studies, which are required to address this question, are hampered by the lack of validated diagnostic tools.

Sequence analysis shows that it shares similarities with two previously identified betacoronaviruses, namely, BtCoV-HKU4, identified in Tylonycteris bats, and BtCov-HKU5, present in Pipistrellus bats, but its closest neighbor is a betacoronavirus isolated from Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats in the Netherlands. During the 2002-2003 epidemic, SARS-CoV adapted to human populations to such an extent that it could no longer infect bat cells. (An alternative explanation is that we have not yet identified the bat species that actually served as the ultimate source for SARS-CoV and that cells from this species would be sensitive to SARS-CoV.) In contrast, MERS-CoV infects both human and bat cells, suggesting a possible direct bat-to-human route of transmission (5). However, since it is unlikely that most infected humans had direct contact with bats, it is more probable that another animal species common on the Arabian Peninsula, such as sheep, goats, cows, or even camels, serves as the direct source for infection. In support of the latter possibility, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dromedary camels sampled in Oman and even in a small percentage (14%) of camels in the Canary Islands (24). Identification of animals that serve as intermediate hosts would help define human populations at risk and might also allow culling or quarantine of infected animals, a method that was used successfully in Hong Kong to decrease the load of pathogenic avian influenza A virus in domestic poultry populations (6).",

Both bat and human DPP4 sensitize resistant cells for infection, supporting the notion that virus could cross species from bats to infect humans (5). DPP4, the receptor, is an ectopeptidase. Similar molecules are also used by other coronaviruses to enter cells, including human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is used by SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, and aminopeptidase N (APN), which is used by several alphacoronaviruses. The catalytic sites of hACE2, APN, and likely DPP4 are not required for virus entry (10). Intriguingly, both hACE2 and DPP4 are shed from the cell surface (11, 12). Loss of hACE2 results in more severe pulmonary disease, while DPP4 is a neutrophil chemorepellent (13). Changes in DPP4 shedding that occur as a result of infection with MERS-CoV could influence the composition of the immune cell infiltrate, thereby ultimately affecting the outcome of the infection. DPP4 is also expressed on immune cells, including T cell lymphocytes (12), and is required for optimal function of these cells, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that MERS-CoV infection of lymphocytes occurs or plays a major role in pathogenesis. Curiously, CEACAM-1, the host cell receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, is also expressed on T cells and is involved in signaling (14), but MHV does not infect T lymphocytes.",

In any case, this feature may allow MERS-CoV replication in the host prior to initiation of the immune response, contributing to enhanced virus levels and poor outcomes.

MERS-CoV-infected macaques develop a nonfatal mild pneumonia. The absence of severe respiratory disease and kidney disease in these nonhuman primates makes it imperative that additional animal models be developed. Thus far, there have been no reports of successful infection of mice or ferrets, but infection of these animals may be initiated or enhanced if the receptor for the virus, human DPP4, is expressed in lieu of the mouse protein. Notably, similar efforts to introduce the human receptor for SARS-CoV resulted in a transgenic mouse that developed an overwhelming neuronal infection (19, 20). These mice were useful for studies of vaccines and antiviral therapies but not for studies of pathogenesis. As mice engineered to express human DPP4 are developed, it will be important to minimize the likelihood of brain infection by careful attention to tissue-specific expression.",

This is a particular concern in Saudi Arabia, which is both the primary site of MERS infection and the destination for the Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage in which several million Muslims travel to Mecca. Last year\u2019s Hajj did not result in an increase in MERS cases, and it is some comfort that Mecca is located across the country from the governorate of Al-Ahsa.

Mutations were detected throughout the SARS virus genome, but they appear to be most concentrated in the region of the surface glycoprotein involved in binding to the hACE2 molecule. There is every reason to suspect that MERS-CoV will undergo similar mutations that enhance both transmissibility between humans and replication within infected individuals.",
