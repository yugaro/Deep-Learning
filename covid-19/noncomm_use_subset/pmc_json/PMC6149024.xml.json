All three cats in these studies were <2 years old, and they developed papular-to-nodular skin lesions. Histopathologically, the skin lesions reported previously were characterised by a perivascular pyogranulomatous inflammatory reaction in the dermis to subcutis. The presence of coronavirus antigen in macrophages within the skin lesions was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all three cases. However, genetic evidence of mutated FCoV in the cutaneous lesions of FIP has not been reported. Here, we describe a feline case in which a nucleotide mutation in the FCoV spike gene was identified by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule. The mutation was consistent with previous FCoV mutations commonly associated with FIP.7",

Beginning at the age of 2 years and 5 months, unilateral stomatitis in the right mandible became evident. Neither the owner nor the referring veterinarian noticed oral pain in the cat. Although the cat did not show decreased appetite, the cat had lost approximately 0.5 kg of body weight in the previous 6 months. The cat was kept with another Singapura cat that did not show similar clinical signs. Neither of the two cats had received flea-prevention treatments.",

Deep fungal infections and chronic bacterial infection rarely occur in indoor cats, and biopsy sample staining did not support these diagnoses. Therefore, non-effusive FIP was the most appropriate diagnosis for the cutaneous lesion in the present case based on a combination of exclusion diagnoses with immunohistochemistry and molecular diagnostics.",

FCoVs with the M1058L mutation have been identified in 89.9% and 92.0% of cats with effusive and non-effusive FIP, respectively.7 These mutations are thought to allow FCoVs to acquire macrophage tropism, and thus to spread systemically.",
