            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially identified from a 60-year-old Saudi man who was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah (Figure 1) on June 13, 2012, with history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath.1 He subsequently died 11 days later from progressive respiratory failure.1 A sputum sample tested negative for common respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus). Inoculation of sputum in LLC-MK2 and Vero cells resulted in viral cytopathic changes.1 The virus was later identified as a new coronavirus and called Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (HCoV-EMC).1 A subsequent patient from Qatar, a 49- year-old man, was diagnosed in September 2012 with the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and he was transported to the United Kingdom for intensive care.2 The isolated viruses from the Saudi and the Qatari cases were 99.5% identical.2 Subsequently, the virus was designated as MERS-CoV instead of HCoV-EMC according to the Coronavirus Study Group.3 Retrospective analysis of stored samples from an outbreak in Zarqa, Jordan of a cluster of hospital cases of severe respiratory illness dating back to April 2012 confirmed MERS-CoV as the cause of the outbreak.4 Since the initial description and as of July 14, 2014, a total of 834 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 288 (34.5%) deaths were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).5 In this review, we highlight the epidemiology and disease control measures of MERS-CoV. We reviewed the available literature from the beginning of June 2012 to June 2014 utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar.",

Initial cases were reported among elderly patients with a median age of 56 years. A summary of demographics of major MERS-CoV studies is shown in Table 1.6,7,9\u201312 During the second quarter of 2014 (April\u2013May) there was an unusual increase in the number of reported cases from Saudi Arabia. From April 11 to June 9, 2014, a total of 515 cases of MERS-CoV were reported to WHO.11 A total of 113 cases were reported on June 2, 2014 retrospectively to WHO. These cases are summarized in Table 1. Of the initial cases, there were eleven cases of childhood MERS-CoV and all but two of the cases were asymptomatic.13",

The initial predominance of male cases may be due to the characteristics of the outbreak in Al-Hasa (Figure 1).6 As more cases were identified, this predominance was lost and a more balanced sex distribution started to reflect the true distribution of the cases. In an initial analysis of the first 179 cases, there were some differences between primary (sporadic and index cases) and secondary cases.14 Primary cases were more likely to be male (80% versus 58%), and to be older (median age: 58 years versus 48 years). Health care workers constituted 35% of secondary cases versus 3% of the primary cases.14 When comparing the Al-Hasa outbreak in 2013 with the most recent cases in April\u2013May 2014, the Al-Hasa cases were older in age (56 years versus 46 years), there were more male cases (male-to-female ratio 2.8:1 versus 1.4:1), there were more severe cases (100% versus 44.5%), and there was a higher mortality rate (65% versus 28.3%) (Table 1).6,7,9\u201312",

Further phylogenetic analysis of this outbreak showed that only eight of the 13 epidemiologic transmissions were related, suggesting multiple introductions of MERS-CoV in that outbreak.47 The most recent health care transmission occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in April\u2013May 2014. There was no change in the virus transmission or mutation.48 Near full genome sequence analyses of three viruses from the early phase of the Jeddah outbreak were highly similar but not identical, with no genome insertions or deletions.48 Most of the human-to-human infections were in the health care setting and 25% of all cases were health care workers.49 In April 2014, another health-care-associated cluster was reported from Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates and resulted in infection of 16 health care workers of the 23 total cases.50 The recent increase in the number of cases of MERS-CoV in April\u2013May 2014 showed that 75% of the cases were secondary cases and that most of these cases were health care workers who acquired the infection in the health care setting.24 In the most recent outbreak in Saudi Arabia, of the 402 cases reported in June 2014, at least 25% were health care workers.11 One study showed that health care workers who contracted MERS-CoV were involved in aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, airway suctioning, and sputum induction.49\u201351",
