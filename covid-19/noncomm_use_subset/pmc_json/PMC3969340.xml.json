There are broadly two distinct PRRSV genotypes, the European (type I) and the North American (type II), which possess a wide range of intra- and intergenotypic, genetic, and antigenic diversity.2 Therefore, developing preventive measures to control PRRS outbreaks has been a challenge to the global swine industry.",

Live virus vaccines are successful in reducing the clinical disease, but are invariably implicated in spreading the mutated viruses to susceptible pigs.3 In contrast, available inactivated PRRSV vaccines are safe, but they have failed to elicit protective immunity even against homologous infections.4 In addition, killed vaccine antigens do not undergo intracellular antigen presentation pathways to induce a strong cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response, which is necessary for clearance of intracellular pathogens like viruses.5\u20137 Thus, research aimed at developing better cross-protective inactivated PRRSV vaccines is warranted. Therefore, several innovative strategies should be adopted to strengthen potency and efficacy of inactivated/killed PRRSV vaccine antigens (KAg), with respect to suitable methods of viral inactivation and purification, use of potent adjuvants, route, and efficient delivery of vaccine to protect Ags from rapid enzymatic degradation in the body.",

The intranasal route of delivery of vaccines to control primary respiratory infections has shown great promise in induction of protective mucosal (ie, local) as well as systemic immunity.5,9,10 Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) is a synthetic biodegradable polymer used successfully in particulate delivery of inactivated vaccines.11\u201313 The adjuvant Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (M. tb WCL) was shown to augment immunogenicity of both live PRRSV vaccine and PLGA-nanoparticles entrapped with killed PRRSV antigens (NP-KAg) without causing any side effects in pigs14\u201317 and with other vaccines in rodents, guinea pigs and rabbits.18,19 Unlike complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA), M. tb WCL is free from water-insoluble toxic cell wall components of the bacterium,20,21 and it is endotoxin free and contains only water-soluble components.19 Therefore, unlike CFA, M. tb WCL does not cause any toxicity or granulomatous lesions at the site of inoculation.19 Previously, we have shown that a single dose of PRRSV KAg-entrapped in PLGA (50:50) nanoparticle (NP-KAg) elicits both mucosal and systemic immune responses.22,23 Recently, NP-KAg coadministered intranasally twice with M. tb WCL induced cross-protective anti-PRRSV immune response in blood to a challenged heterologous PRRSV, associated with a significant reduction in viremia.14 In this report, we made use of various types of the lung samples of that recent study14 to evaluate viral load and local mucosal immunity both at airway surfaces and in the lung parenchyma, and also microscopic lung histopathology in vaccinated, heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs.",

Representative histograms of IFN-\u03b3 producing LMNCs stimulated with PRRSV KAg of Group 6 pigs vaccinated with two different doses of vaccine are shown (Figure 5A and B). The frequencies of intracellular IFN-\u03b3+ cells in LMNCs either unstimulated or stimulated with MN184 Ags identified the virus-specific memory lymphocyte response. Significantly increased PRRSV-specific recall IFN-\u03b3 response was detected both in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets of Group 6 pigs vaccinated with a high dose of vaccine (Figure 5C and D). These data suggest that both T-helper and CTLs were potentially primed in the lungs of only Group 6 pigs. When PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting lymphocyte subsets in only restimulated cells were compared among different vaccine trial groups, only in Group 6 animals (both vaccines doses) significantly increased CD4+CD8\u2212IFN-\u03b3+ cells compared to Group 2 animals (Figure 5F and N), while CD4\u2212CD8+IFN-\u03b3+ cell frequency was significantly enhanced in Group 6 pigs were present compared to Groups 2, 3, and 5 with low vaccine dose and Groups 2 to 5 with high vaccine dose (Figure 5G and O).",

Microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained lung sections helped to identify the magnitude of lung area affected with pneumonic inflammatory lesions. The lung sections of virus-challenged pig Groups 2, 3, and 5 vaccinated with a high dose of vaccine had severe pneumonic lesions with massive perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells (Figure 6I\nii, iii, and v). These data were consistent with the gross lung lesions, especially in pig Groups 2 and 3; also, these pig groups had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during first week postchallenge. In contrast, the absence of any clinical PRRS disease and gross lung lesions in Group 6 pigs was associated with the absence of detectable microscopic lung pathology, and the lung architecture was comparable to mock pigs (Figure 6I\nvi). The other pig group which had moderately reduced lung lesions was Group 4 (KAg + M. tb WCL) (Figure 6I\niv), suggesting the adjuvant mediated protective immune response in pigs. Similar but severe lung pathology was observed in pigs receiving the low vaccine dose in Groups 2, 3, and 5 (data not shown).",

Thus, development of a novel PRRSV mucosal vaccine is warranted. Further, among the mucosal routes, intranasal delivery of NP-based vaccine elicits a higher and longer duration of IgG and IgA antibody responses compared to rectal, oral, or intramuscular routes.46 In the lungs, PRRSV infects both alveolar and interstitial macrophages,47 and greater than 90% of BAL cells are macrophages.48 We investigated anti-PRRSV response both in BAL cells and LMNCs. CD11c+ APCs are richly present in the lungs in both BAL cells and LMNCs, but they differ in their antigen presentation potential. APCs present in the lung mucosal surfaces (represented by BAL cells) activate only antigen-primed T-cells, while APCs in the lung parenchyma (represented by LMNCs) activate both na\u00efve and antigen-primed T-cells.49 Therefore, our study comprehensively investigated overall immune responses and viral load in the lungs of pigs vaccinated and challenged through the intranasal route.",

Like in PBMCs, increased but comparable frequency of other IFN-\u03b3+ lymphocyte subsets in both restimulated and unstimulated cells was observed in LMNCs of Group 6 pigs, suggesting that other T-effector and NK cells were actively secreting IFN-\u03b3 in the lungs to PRRSV-challenge infection. Due to lack of similar data on IFN-\u03b3+ lymphocytes in vaccinated pigs isolated prior to challenge, it is difficult to demarcate the vaccine-alone induced response.",

In the lung homogenates of low-dose (but not high-dose) adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, high avidity IgA response was observed; the reason for this discrepancy could be the time of lung sample collection. Overall, our results suggested that virus-specific functional IgA response at mucosal tissues (lungs) was enhanced in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs. Further, our results indicated that in the lung mucosal surfaces, IgA isotype appears to play an important role, while in the lung parenchyma both IgA and IgG isotypes contribute to protective immune response. VN antibodies against putative neutralizing epitopes on PRRSV GP5 and M glycoproteins play an important role in PRRSV clearance.65 In Group 6 pigs, high levels of cross-reactive VN titers were detected against a challenged PRRSV MN184 strain, another heterologous type II viral strain, and most importantly-even against a highly variant heterogenotypic strain (PRRSV SD03-15), confirming the broadly cross-protective nature of adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine formulation. Further, PRRSV antibody avidity results were positively correlated with VN titers, in agreement with a previous report.31",

A robust CMI response is essential for complete protection against PRRSV.17 A crucial Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, is produced by NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD4+CD8+ T cells. Enhanced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and the presence of increased frequencies of IFN-\u03b3+ memory CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs have confirmed the additive effect of PLGA-mediated delivery and adjuvanticity of M. tb WCL. A possible mechanism of improved CMI response in Group 6 pigs was mediated by cross-presentation of PLGA-entrapped Ags to CD8+ T cells through MHC class I molecules, of dendritic cells and macrophages.67 Thus, our results were consistent with the previous reports on PLGA NP-based vaccines, which elicited strong effector and memory CMI responses.68,69 In addition, increased levels of another important Th1 cytokine, IL-12,70 was detected in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, associated with reduced production of immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, which play a vital role in PRRSV pathogenesis.17 The \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are present in high frequency in pigs and are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity at mucosal tissues.71 Enhanced frequency of activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the lungs of Group 6 pigs was observed.

Each bar indicates the mean viral titer or viral RNA copy number of three pigs \u00b1 standard error of mean of the indicated group. Asterisk indicates statistically significant (P<0.05) difference between the two indicated pig groups. Abbreviations: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; Chal, challenge; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; KAg, killed/inactivated antigen; NP-KAg, nanoparticle-entrapped killed antigen; NP-WCL, nanoparticle-entrapped whole-cell lysate of M. tb; PRRSV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; RNA, ribonucleic acid; TCID50, median tissue culture infective dose; WCL, whole-cell lysate of M. tb; M. tb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
