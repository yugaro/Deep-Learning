Monocytes are differentiated based on the cell surface expression of two markers: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein CD14 and the Fc\u03b3 receptor CD16. In 2010, the nomenclature was modified to include three subtypes of monocytes based on these two markers. Classical monocytes display a CD14++ CD16- phenotype and represent 80-90% of all monocytes. The minor populations consist of CD14++ CD16+ (intermediate) and CD14+ CD16++ (non-classical) monocytes.14 Monocytes expressing both CD14 and CD16 show a more mature morphological and functional phenotype than their CD16- counterparts and are thought to constitute the specific precursors of tissue-resident macrophages.15 Our studies use this new classification system, however many of the references use the old nomenclature and so will be referred to as originally published.",

In particular, we determined binding specificity, which particular monocyte subset is targeted, the mode of cellular entry and the receptors involved. a2NTD bound to monocytes and binding could be competed out with unlabeled peptide. a2NTD was internalized by monocytes and THP-1 cells, though the latter demonstrated slower uptake kinetics. In addition, a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by CD14++CD16+ monocytes and these cells produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), as compared with CD142+CD16- monocytes. The endocytosis of a2NTD occurred via a macropinocytosis mechanism that required actin filament and microtubule polymerization. Blocking a2NTD endocytosis had no effects on the intracellular levels of IL-1. Taken together, these data suggest that a2NTD stimulates monocytes to generate pro-inflammatory cytokines via a receptor-mediated mechanism. This putative receptor represents a potential point of intervention that can be further investigated to prevent the maturation of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).",

There were more a2NTD-positive monocytes, as assessed by flow cytometry, at 37\u00b0C (75%) than at 4\u00b0C (15%) (Fig. 1E).

In comparison, trypsin-treated cells cultured at 37\u00b0C exhibited a reduced surface staining but maintained the punctuate intracellular staining (Fig. 2D). To eliminate non-specific phagocytosis as a mechanism of cellular uptake, neutrophils were separately examined. Neutrophils demonstrated much less endocytosis of a2NTD than monocytes, but slightly more than lymphocytes (Fig. S1). Finally, the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was also examined. While the uptake trend is similar in THP-1 cells and monocytes, the kinetics are much slower for the former.

When THP-1 cells were incubated with fluorescence 10 kDa dextran, cell fluorescence at 37\u00b0C increased similar to that of monocytes. The macropinocytotic response of THP-1 cells was also sensitive to DMA.

However, only monocytes (but not THP-1 cells) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon a2NTD stimulation.16 This is consistent with the concept that THP-1 cells express less or lack some of the proteins that mediate the endocytosis of a2NTD. Monocytes stimulated with a2NTD in the presence of trafficking inhibitors produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the entry of a2NTD is not necessary for cytokine production (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these data suggest a possible dual receptor process. Thus, while both monocytes and THP-1 cells appear to express the a2NTD receptor that is important for IL-1\u03b2 secretion, only monocytes have a second receptor that brings a2NTD into the cell and leads to intracellular ROS production. In monocytes, ROS may be a redundant amplification signal to produce additional inflammatory cytokines. THP-1 cells seem not to express this putative receptor to sufficient levels and thus cannot produce ROS in response to a2NTD.",

Previous data indicate that the production of IL-1 is privileged over that of TNF\u03b1 after a2NTD stimulation. The data presented here are consistent with these findings. While CD14+CD16+ monocytes have been extensively studied for their role in infectious diseases and inflammation,42 their role in tumorigenesis has only recently been explored.43,44 The interaction of CD14++CD16- monocytes with a2NTD, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines represents a new area of research for how the monocyte subsets are functionally defined.",
