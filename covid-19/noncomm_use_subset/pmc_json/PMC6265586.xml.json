FMD viruses (FMDVs) are a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [16] and belong to the genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae [4]; the size of the virus genome is approximately 8.5 kb. These viruses are classified into seven serotypes\u2014A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3\u2014 and more than 60 subtypes [16]. FMD outbreaks cause a reduction in the productivity of infected animals (e.g., pigs, cows, lambs, and goats) [23]. The culling of infected animals and events such as environmental contamination and loss of revenue from the livestock have emerged as important socioeconomic issues [2123].",

Antiviral agents using chemical compounds are easily synthesized and scaled up in bulk, and they can be stored for a long period because chemical compounds are more stable than biologics. In addition, it was reported that such agents act directly on viruses as RNA inhibitors and are not specific to certain serotypes; thus, they may be administered to animals for emergency use when FMD occurs. FMD has never been eradicated and occurs in many countries in the world; regardless, research on antiviral agents to prevent and treat FMDVs is still limited.",

T1105, a favipiravir derivative, exhibited antiviral activity at a high dose (200\u2212400 mg/kg/day) in pigs [26]. It was also reported that pyrimidylthiophene and 2-aminothiazole compounds showed antiviral activity against FMDV-infected cells [9]. Another study reported that ribavirin may be helpful in inhibiting the replication of FMDVs in cells and protecting against their transmission in mice [33]. The antiviral agent interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) was expressed using a recombinant adenovirus to verify its protective effect against FMDV in pigs [812]. A high concentration of IFN-\u03b1 was measured in serum from pigs [619] to verify the effects of the adenovirus. By utilizing IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and a recombinant adenovirus in combination, inhibition of the replication of FMDV was induced, delaying clinical symptoms [1415]. Moreover, protection against FMDV in adult mice using IFN inducers such as polyinosinic (poly C) [28] and CpG [13] has been verified [31], and it was reported that protection against FMDV was possible in pigs by using IFN combinations [20]. It was also reported that antiviral agents (compounds, IFN, small interfering RNA) were helpful in protecting against FMD [15622].",

In a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2103, cells were treated for 3 h with MTS (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Replication Assay; Promega, USA) after 48 h of incubation. Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at 490 nm (Molecular Device, USA), and the 50% effective concentration (EC50) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated using GraphPad 5.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). EC50 is the effective concentration where the cytopathic effect is 50% with the control value as the standard; the CC50 is the cytotoxicity concentration at which normal cells account for 50% of the total cells based on the control value (Table 1).",

IFN-\u03b1 and gamma provide protection against RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus [2932]. Among the different antiviruses, oral treatment of hepatitis by ribavirin and aerosolized ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration [11].

The provision of agents absorbed into feed more effectively treated FMD than the oral administration of ribavirin. When the agents were absorbed into feed, there can be almost continuous oral administration, maintaining the in vivo concentration. However, there is a disadvantage in that the agents are administered only when the animals voluntarily consume the feed; thus, a lack of appetite, which may accompany infection with FMDV, may result in lower effectiveness.",

We think that the antiviral agents may be commonly effective in different serotypes. In prior research, guinea pigs were IP inoculated with ribavirin (45 mg/kg) for two weeks, and their survival after exposure to Argentine hemorrhagic fever (Junin virus) was extended from 15 to 25 days; similarly, when the animals were IP inoculated with 60 mg/kg of ribavirin for 25 days their survival was extended from 14 to 37 days [30]. These results show that life extension is possible but the protection is incomplete. In the present study, the measured amount of FMDV in the serum of the mice showed that 15 mg/day of ribavirin may inhibit the replication of FMDVs within approximately 4 days. When the mice were inoculated with agents along with vaccines, or when adjuvants were used, the concentration of ribavirin was reduced to 6 mg/day, resulting in the survival of all adult mice. Considering the research result in which survival rates were heightened when adult mice were inoculated with oil or gel as the adjuvant along with an antiviral reagent, the use of adjuvant with antiviral agents might have extended the antiviral reactivity in the mice. This outcome proves that the dose of the injection, rather than the method of administration, more strongly affects the reagent's protective effect against FMDVs. Assuming that target animals in farms are typically re-infected by FMDVs, a second round of challenge was performed; under those conditions, there was a slight weight change but no change in survival rates. Thus, immunity generated through the first infection may protect against pathogenic re-infection. SP antibodies against FMDV were not detected because virus replication was inhibited by vaccines or ribavirin until day 10. The antiviral agent, ribavirin, helped to delay clinical signs when pigs were challenged with FMDV. The pig group treated with ribavirin and vaccine did not show any clinical signs or measured RNA copy numbers in test swabs. Therefore, we think that ribavirin is an excellent antiviral agent to protect against FMDV, and it can provide early immunity.",

For a future application, the determination of safe and effective administration amounts of ribavirin in the field animals, such as cattle and pigs, should be a priority.
