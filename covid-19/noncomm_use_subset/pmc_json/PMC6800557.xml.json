In the first steps of imagining such a fantasy, Seeman used branched DNA with sticky ends to prepare and introduce the first two-dimensional (2D) DNA crystal structure in 2003.6 One year later, Turberfield et al, attempted the one-stage self-assembly of the first DNA cage (DNA tetrahedra) as a typical example of DNA-fabricated nanocarrier (DNA box) for encapsulation of biomolecules.7 Later, functionalization strategies, such as the integration of aptamers, allowed construction of more advanced DNA boxes with the controllable opening-closing performance of box/lid to allow for demand-driven freight exposure/release (box opening) for simultaneous biosensing and the triggering of a therapeutic effect only at the desired site (cancer cells). In addition, due to the unique sequence of DNA molecule used in the construction of these finite-sized DNs, the resulting structures are fully addressable and adaptable in terms of conjugation with a variety of functional units such as small molecules, macromolecules and inorganic nanoparticles that can be easily and accurately (with nanometer precision) placed anywhere on or in such structures (Table 1).\n",

Accordingly, this review aims to provide an overview of the current design formats, benefits and applications of static DNA nanostructures (DNs) including DNA origami nanostructures (DONs), DNA arrays/bioreactors, DNA polyhedra (DNA cage), DNA nanoflower, hydrogel, dendrimer and DNA nanoswitch as emerging promising platforms for cancer treatment in the preclinical settings.",

Looking at the methods for production of DN, there are the scaffold-free tile assembly method (Figure 1A) and the scaffold DNA origami method (Figure 1B). The multi-strand tile method is a bottom-up approach used in the first preparation of two-directional DNA polyhedra. In short, in this process, each tile is made from several single stranded DNA (ssDNA) with sticky ends, where cohesion between complementary strands from different tiles can lead to the assembly of larger structures such as 2D arrays as well as polyhedra (Figure 1A). In the meantime, DNA origami follows a top-down scaffold-mediated approach in which a long ssDNA usually M13 genomic DNA is forced to fold into DONs using short ssDNA oligonucleotides called staples. What\u2019s more, staple act as docking sites for functionalization by nanoparticles and biomolecules. In this way, and with the help of computer programs DNA origami objects can be designed and assembled in almost any form.99 These modifications together with biocompatibility and biostability100\u2013102 have made DNA origami nanostructures suitable platforms for targeted delivery, imaging, and controlled release of therapeutic cargoes.14,103\u2013107",

That, using multivalent DNA biochips revealed cooperative work of EGF-integrin in modulating the behavior of melanoma cancer cell in a number and ratio-dependent manner.112 Furthur examples of DON in cancer therapy and drug delivery can be found in.99,113",

The adaptability of the design permits precise control of nanoparticle size, the spatial orientation, and density of targeting ligands on the nanoparticle surface or the inside, which could lead to enhanced delivery of the siRNAs into cells and efficient gene silencing.124 Moreover, DNA polyhedra were used as carriers of chemotherapeutics to overcome multi-drug resistance in cancer cells.118 Similarly, aptamer-decorated DNA icosahedral nanoparticles were used to deliver Dox molecules.58 The construction of cage-like DNA structures called nanosuitcases was reported for siRNA loading and on-demand release upon recognition of an oligonucleotide marker (eg, mRNA or a microRNA (miRNA)(Figure 3D).50 In addition, the pH-triggered controlled release of Dox-intercalated nanoring functionalized with mucin aptamer (MUC1) was shown to have therapeutic potential for breast cancer.125 In another example, hybrid systems such as DNA polyhedron-caged gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were produced for the controlled release of Dox when triggered by pH and DNA enzyme (T7 exonuclease).93 Moreover, DNA tetrahedron structures are used as molecular probes with high-sensitivity for DNA target detection and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing of biological fluids, as well as protein biosensing (Figure 3E) in vitro.126",

Functionality could be achieved by i) covalently bound chemical groups (eg, amine, thiol, and carboxyl groups) or molecules (eg, biotin), or ii) DNA overhangs (eg, aptamers).129 In one of these systems, the chemical conjugation of amino-modified DNA oligonucleotides was demonstrated with chlorohexane or benzylguanine groups as orthogonal tags for the genetic modification of proteins of interest fused with Halo-Tag or Snap-tag, respectively. Authors reported orthogonal modified DNA origami by decorating DNA origami with multiple proteins including mKate-Snap, CCP-Halo, and mSTV, which resemble the characteristic of human face including mouth, eyes, and nose, respectively (Figure 4A).130 Another study used DNA-binding potential of zinc finger proteins for site-specific protein positioning on DNA origami.131 Previous formats of DNA nanoarrays were also attempted in 2005 by DNA hybridization-mediated adhesion of Au nanoparticles of different sizes to prescribed locations on DNA tiles, producing alternating rows of the two components (Figure 4B).132 DNA nanotubes conjugated with two enzymes, horseradish peroxidase, and glucose oxidase, demonstrated enzymatic cascade, as an example of the nanoscale DNA-based bioreactor.127 Moreover, punched DNA origami assembly was exploited for the design of robust and precisely programmed 2D streptavidin nanoarrays by the periodical embedding of biotinylated nanowells in DNA origami structures (Figure 4C).133",

This reaction requires only a primer and template DNA to control over size, construct and functionalization of nanoflowers. This means that the rational design of any RCR-suitable templates allows the elongated DNA building blocks to carry a large number of concatemer functional or structural moieties, which further condense into NFs.136 Due to the dense DNA packaging, NFs resist to nuclease degradation, dissociation or denaturation. Recently, the NF blooming (formation) principle has been used to design a simple and sensitive electrochemical biosensing system. In this preparation, the NF blooming in the nanochannels has been tailored to occur upon binding of target miRNA, followed by binding of a circle template DNA and a specific primer to the captured miRNA, triggering RCA and NF blooming in the nanochannels. NF formation increased steric hindrance in the channels, which reduced the anodic current of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), thus producing enhanced electrochemical detection signals (Figure 5A).135",

In this sense, construction of aptamer conjugated multicolor fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-NFs is reported with applications in multiplexed cellular bioimaging and drug screening, in which NF were integrated with three different fluorophores (FAM, Cy3, and ROX), therapeutic drug payloads (Dox), and two aptamers (sgc8 and MUC 1). In addition, single wavelength excitation leads to multi-fluorescence emissions of NF, allowing monitoring of drug transport for targeted drug delivery (Figure 5B).10 Moreover, immuno-nanoflowers have been developed for nuclease resistance and efficient CpG delivery.36 CpG NFs were found to be potent immunostimulators capable of triggering the proliferation of macrophage-like cells that stimulated the secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines that induced apoptosis and necrosis of cancer cells. Moreover, pH-responsive multifunctional DNA NFs containing cancer-targeting aptamer, fluorophores, and Dox molecules were used to prevent drug efflux and improve drug retention in MDR cells, thus bypassing MDR and reducing side effects (Figure 5C).136,137 In addition, using microflower nanosystem, synergistic nanovaccines were constructed for effective immunotherapy of cancer. The NFs were formulated to comprise intertwining DNA-RNA nanocapsules (iDR-NCs) conjugated with DNA CpG, STAT3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) adjuvants, as well as tumor-specific peptide neoantigens. shRNA in iDR-NCs synergistically activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), primed CD8+ T cells, induced T cell memory, and markedly suppressed the progression of neoantigen-specific colorectal tumors (Figure 5B).68",

            "text": "As relatively complicated DNs, DNA dendrimer with a branched configuration can be developed by the facile modular assembly. DNA dendrimers are layer-by-layer self-assembled functional branched DNA units (eg, Y-shaped building blocks) made through predesigned base-pairing hybridization. These somewhat bulkier DNs form promising scaffolds for versatile biomedical applications (Figure 6). For example, they can accommodate more docking sites for loading drugs or other functional materials. Moreover, by implementing functional DNA units, these structures can be constructed into targeted and stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems. Also, sterically crowded conformations, homogeneous controlled sizes, and structural stability are additional advantages of dendrimeric nanostructures. Furthermore, they can be used as biosensing devices. For instance, DNA dendrimers coupled with DNA nanomachines (DNA circuits) has realized an ultrasensitive biosensor with a detection limit of 0.0661 pg/mL and 0.062 nM for laminin15 and KRAS gene fragment (Figure 6A),140 respectively. Tailoring the capture and reporter DNA/protein units can extend the prognostic value of such dendrimer-based self-amplification system for detection of a different disease-related species with high sensitivity in biological samples. Moreover, achieving a therapeutic effect, catalytically self-assembled siRNA-based gene silencing via functionalized DNA dendritic complexes was constructed. Incorporated sgc8c aptamers to DNA dendrimers enabled targeting of overexpressed protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) receptor on tumor cells and led to higher gene silencing efficiency with lower cytotoxicity when compared to the commercial cationic lipid transfection agents.141 Another study demonstrated that the formulation of dendrimeric siRNA improves condensation, stability, and gene silencing efficiencies.52 Moreover, branched DNA constructs \u2013containing anti-miRNA\u2013 have been used for oncomiRNA targeting of cancer. In another report, a multifunctional dendrimeric-based system composing of tumor-targeting ligands \u2013such as MUC1, AS1411, and ATP aptamers\u2013 was used for high loading and controlled delivery of an anthracycline drug called \u201cepirubicin\u201d to cancer cells. MUC1 and AS1411 aptamer were coated on the surface of dendrimer to assist crossing the cellular and nuclear membranes, respectively. Meanwhile, ATP aptamer incorporated in the building blocks directed dendrimer to the ATP-enriched lysozymes where more dendrimer disassembly can occur.28 Furthermore, ligase-independent efficient self-assembly of DNA dendrimer is reported by annealing DNA units with elongated adhesive ends. These structures were used for delivery of immunostimulatory CpG DNA encoding tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 to immune cells.142 Programmable DNA dendrimers coated with CpG-containing hairpin-loops were found to trigger stronger immune responses than those conjugated with linear CpG. Further surface functionalization of DNA dendrimer with TAT \u2013a classic cell-penetrating peptide\u2013 enhanced cell internalization and cytokines production (Figure 6B).34",

Binding of the aptamer to EpCAM triggers subsequent aptamer-triggered hybridization chain reaction (HCR) via toehold-initiated branch migration for simultaneous capturing and clocking of live single/clustered CTCs in porous DNA hydrogel with minimal cell damage. Moreover, controlled decloaking of CTCs was affordable using defined chemical stimuli to release intact living CTCs for subsequent culture and live cell analysis (Figure 7B).61",

This DNA nanohydrogel is a promising anti-cancer material due to its modularity, multifunctionality, programmability, excellent biocompatibility, and biostability. It also provides active targeting and controllable transportation of drug to the on-target cells. Moreover, using such a system drug resistance was reduced due to inhibition of P-gp expression \u2013the anti-cancer drug efflux pump receptor\u2013by the MDR1 siRNA.158 Similarly, catalytic hybridization was used for assembly of aptamer-based nanohydrogels (Y-gel-Apt), by employing two Y-shaped monomers (YMA, YMB) and a DNA linker (LK) bearing disulfide linkages and sticky ends. YMA contained a DNAzyme sequence for targeting MMP-9 and antisense oligonucleotide sequence in LK that enabled targeting of c-raf-1 \u2013a tumor proliferation marker. Sticky ends were used for hybridization-mediated self-assembly whereas disulfide linkages led to the rapid fragmentation of nanohydrogels under cancer reductive environment, enabling a stimuli-responsive effective gene therapy (Figure 7C).54 More examples of aptamer-incorporated hydrogels for theranostics applications are overviewed elsewhere.",

These complexes consisted of lipidated versions of a hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMet) binding aptamer and a separate lipidated GC-rich DNA hairpin motif bearing intercalated Dox. Multiple 2\u2019,6\u2019-dimethylazobenzene moieties were incorporated into the Dox-binding motif to trigger the release of the chemotherapeutics by photoisomerization. The combined features of these nanocarriers increased serum nuclease resistance, favored their import into cells, allowed the selective photo-induced release of the chemotherapeutic into the targeted cells, and enhanced cell mortality.74 In addition, pH-responsive and light-responsive DNA microcapsules that encapsulated different loads including Dox-modified dextran, tetramethylrhodamine-modified dextran, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, MP-11 and microperoxidase-11 has been described for controlled cargo release and cancer therapy in vitro.26 The pH-responsive microcapsules composed of a cytosine-rich layer cross-linked by nucleic acid bridges and the light-responsive microcapsules were made of photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl-phosphate-modified DNA shells.26",

            "text": "Since its inception in the early 1980s and the invention of DNA origami in 2006, DNA nanotechnology has made remarkable strides towards a veriety of applications. In view of our interest in the era of cancer research, we provided an overview of the advances in DNA nanotechnology at the interface of static DNA-based devices and their broad applications in the field of bio/nanomedicine (Table 1). Compared to other nanomaterials, such as polymeric, organic, metallic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, etc., the beauty of DN can be attributed to the simple principle of base pairing that allows construction of an unlimited number of nanostructures with different sizes, shapes, charges, and modularity to serve for a specific purpose. For example, DNA polyhedra (DNA box), and hydrogel are both porous structures that can accommodate therapeutic agent inside while functional ligands/moieties can be coated on the surface of DN. DNA box toolkits are meant for on-command opening (provided by aptamer) and exposure of cloaked cytotoxic drugs, when only the correct trigger (eg, ATP) is available, allowing effective on-target drug delivery. In addition to its function as a drug carrier, the hydrogel structure offers an additional advantage as it can undergo reversible changes of shape (gel/sol state), size (shrunken/swollen) and charge (deprotonated/protonated). Such potential to capture and adapt to changes in the microenvironment is important for the design of nanocarriers taking into account the dynamic and heterogeneous microenvironment of cancer cells. For example, pH-responsive hydrogel (provided by azo-linker) allows the shrunk hydrogel to enter the endo-lysosomes where the size expansion occurs within the low pH endo-lysosomal vesicles, resulting in a larger pore size and thus the leakage of cytotoxic drugs to induce cancer cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, acid-triggered protonated hydrogel that results in size expansion and electrostatic repulsion of DN promotes endo-lysosomal burst release of hydrogel into the cytosol. Under normal pH, the hydrogel can shrink back to its original size, and its subsequent transport outside the dead cell starts another cycle of penetration into the nearby cancer cells.164 This way, recycling hydrogel can penetrate into the deeper regions of the tumor by peeling off tumor layers one after another to envision an enhanced therapeutic index for cancer therapy.",
