            "text": "Studies over the past decade have shown that sirtuins, members of a phylogenetically conserved protein family that shares homology to the budding yeast silencing factor Sir2 (silent information regulator), affect a broad range of cellular functions encompassing cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. The seven mammalian sirtuins, denoted SIRT1\u2013SIRT7, have distinct cellular locations and target multiple substrates. By utilizing NAD+ as cofactor, sirtuins act either as deacetylases or ADP-ribosyltransferases, and have emerged as key metabolic sensors that link environmental signals to metabolic homeostasis and stress response. SIRT7 is enriched in nucleoli, where it promotes cell growth and proliferation by driving rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis (1). SIRT7 expression correlates with cell growth, being high in metabolically active cells, and low or even absent in non-proliferating cells (1\u20134). In epithelial prostate carcinomas, high SIRT7 levels are associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, metastatic disease and poor patient prognosis (5). High expression of SIRT7 is steadily propelling cells towards an oncogenic status. Depletion of SIRT7 or overexpression of a catalytically inactive point mutant leads to decreased cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (6). SIRT7-knockout mice suffer from increased embryonic lethality, reduced stress resistance, inflammatory cardiomyopathy and premature aging (7\u201310). Moreover, SIRT7 catalyzes deacetylation of lysine 18 at histone H3 (H3K18ac), a biomarker of aggressive tumors. Hypoacetylation of H3K18 compromises transcription of genes that are linked to tumor suppression and facilitates DNA repair (10,11).",

            "text": "Previous work has established that SIRT7 is a key regulator of nucleolar transcription and pre-rRNA processing. SIRT7 is enriched in nucleoli and activates RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription by deacetylating PAF53 (Polymerase-Associated Factor 53), a core subunit of mammalian Pol I (12). Hypoacetylation of PAF53 enhances pre-rRNA synthesis by facilitating the association of Pol I with rDNA, thereby promoting Pol I transcription. Additionally, SIRT7 regulates processing of pre-rRNA by deacetylating U3-55k, a core component of the U3 snoRNP complex. Reversible acetylation modulates the association of U3-55k protein with U3 snoRNA, deacetylation by SIRT7 enhancing the interaction (13). Upon exposure to cellular stress, SIRT7 is released from nucleoli and accumulates in the nucleoplasm, which leads to hyperacetylation of both PAF53 and U3-55k and defects in transcription and processing of pre-rRNA. These results indicated that SIRT7 controls ribosome biogenesis through a mechanism involving binding to pre-rRNA and U3 snoRNA as well as nucleolar-nucleoplasmic shuttling in response to stress signaling. The role of SIRT7 in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation is also supported by recent proteomic analyses showing that SIRT7 is associated with numerous non-nucleolar target proteins with functions in transcription, ribosome biogenesis and translation (14\u201316). SIRT7 was also found to interact with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as B-WICH, NoRC and SWI/SNF, which are required for the establishment of a specific chromatin structure. Furthermore, SIRT7 was shown to occupy tRNA genes and to interact with Pol III and TFIIIC2, suggesting a regulatory role of SIRT7 in Pol III transcription (14,16).",

            "text": "The present work extends these previous studies, aiming to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SIRT7 in transcription activation. We found that a large fraction of the SIRT7 interactome depends on ongoing transcription and/or the presence of RNA. The N-terminal part of SIRT7 binds to RNA and mediates RNA-dependent interactions with SIRT7 target proteins. Consistent with SIRT7 function not being restricted to processes related to ribosome biogenesis, we show that SIRT7 is associated with Pol II and regulates transcription of snoRNAs and other Pol II genes. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates the P-TEFb component CDK9. Deacetylation by SIRT7 activates the kinase activity of CDK9, which phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and facilitates transcription elongation. The results reveal a novel function of SIRT7 outside the nucleolus, reinforcing its role as a key regulator of cellular homeostasis.",

After elution with the Flag peptide (200 \u03bcg/ml) and proteinase K digestion (30 min, 55\u00b0C), RNA was isolated, incubated with DNase I (Sigma) and subjected to RT-qPCR. For pull-down experiments, Flag-tagged proteins (1 \u03bcg) were immobilized on M2 agarose and incubated with radiolabeled RNA for 1 h at room temperature in buffer AM-100 supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 U/ml RNasin and protease inhibitors. After stringent washing, captured RNA was extracted, subjected to gel electrophoresis and visualized by PhosphorImaging. Alternatively, 5 \u03bcg of biotinylated 5\u0384ETS-RNA (+10/+389) were incubated with 50 \u03bcl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature in 5 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 0.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20. After washing, 8 pmol of bead-bound RNA were incubated with 70 \u03bcg of nuclear extract from HEK293T cells expressing Flag-tagged SIRT7 or with 20 pmol of purified GST-SIRT7/1-81 in buffer AM-100 supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 U/ml RNasin (Promega) and protease inhibitors (Roche) for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. After washing with 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Tween-20 and protease inhibitors, bound proteins were analyzed on immunoblots.",

To functionally characterize SIRT7-interacting proteins, we purified Flag/HA-tagged SIRT7 from HEK293T cells and analyzed associated proteins by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure S1A). Using stringent inclusion criteria, 357 proteins (\u22652 unique peptides) were identified, the majority residing in the nuclear and nucleolar compartment (Supplementary Table S2). Consistent with previous studies (14\u201316), the SIRT7 interactome was enriched in nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin, nucleophosmin, MYBBP1A, DHX9, DDX21 and ribosomal proteins. In addition to previously reported SIRT7 interacting proteins, a large part of SIRT7-associated proteins identified by our mass spectrometry analysis was novel (Supplementary Figure S1B and Table S2). Classification of proteins revealed prominent groups with functions in transcription, translation, RNA maturation, chromatin organization, DNA repair, and intracellular transport (Figure 1A). The largest fraction comprised proteins with roles in RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis, such as pre-ribosomal factors (PRFs) and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) involved in pre-rRNA folding, processing and posttranscriptional modifications. Proteins with functions in Pol II transcription, such as RPB2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and mRNA processing factors were also identified, suggesting that SIRT7 is involved in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes (Supplementary Table S3).",

Transcription inhibition by actinomycin D (AMD) showed decrease, no changes, or accumulation of individual factors in nucleoli (23). These fine-tuned changes in the inventory of the nucleolus are thought to reflect the partition of proteins between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm according to the physiological state of the cell. To analyze the impact of ongoing transcription on the SIRT7 interactome, we identified SIRT7-associated proteins from untreated or AMD-treated cells (Supplementary Figures S1A and S1F). While 29% of the interactions were sensitive to RNase A treatment, transcription inhibition by AMD resulted in loss or reduction of 78% of SIRT7-associated proteins (Figure 1C, D and Supplementary Table S2). GO analysis revealed that certain subgroups of interacting proteins were more affected than others. For example, proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport or RNA processing showed strongly reduced binding, whereas the interaction with factors implicated in chromatin regulation was only marginally affected. Similar to RNase A treatment, binding of SIRT7 to proteins comprising RNA recognition motifs was impaired in AMD-treated cells. Validation of AMD-sensitive and -insensitive interactions by co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that some proteins, such as UBF or p53, remained bound to SIRT7. However, binding of a substantial fraction of SIRT7-associated proteins, including Pol I, nucleolin and hnRNPK, was markedly decreased after AMD treatment (Figure 1D), indicating that the majority of the SIRT7 interactome depends on ongoing transcription.",

To investigate whether this region is important for RNA-dependent protein interactions, 5\u0384-external spacer (5\u0384-ETS) RNA was immobilized on streptavidin beads and incubated with lysates of cells expressing Flag-tagged wildtype SIRT7 or mutants lacking 32 (\u0394N32) or 78 N-terminal amino acids (\u0394N78). Both wildtype SIRT7 and the \u0394N32 mutant were efficiently pulled-down by immobilized RNA. Deletion of 78 amino acids, however, abolished RNA binding (Figure 2A, upper panels). Furthermore, a GST-fusion protein comprising amino acids 1\u201381 (GST-SIRT7/1\u201381) efficiently interacted with RNA, supporting that the arginine-rich N-terminal part of SIRT7 mediates the interaction of SIRT7 with RNA (Figure 2A bottom panel and Supplementary Figure S2B).",

We therefore reasoned that overexpression of SIRT7 may increase binding of Pol II to genes that are regulated by SIRT7. Indeed, Pol II occupancy at selected Pol II-dependent genes was enhanced after overexpression of wildtype SIRT7 but not mutant SIRT7/H187Y (Figure 4D). Conversely, knockdown of SIRT7 decreased Pol II occupancy at SIRT7-responsive genes to a similar level as Pol I at the rDNA locus, while binding of Pol II to actin and U1 snRNA genes, which are not occupied by SIRT7, was not altered (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figures S4A and S4D). ChIP assays with antibodies against Pol II-pSer5 and Pol II-pSer2 revealed that knockdown of SIRT7 affected the occupancy of both initiating and elongating Pol II, supporting that hyperacetylation of CDK9 prevents CTD phosphorylation and impairs transcription elongation (Figure 4H and Supplementary Figure S4F). This view is substantiated by ChIP assays showing increased occupancy of both SIRT7 and CDK9 at the promoter-proximal region of target genes (Figure 4F). Significantly, the association of CDK9 with these genes was abolished upon knockdown of SIRT7, confirming that downregulation of SIRT7 correlates with abrogation of CDK9 binding (Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure S4F). To further strengthen the functional link between SIRT7 and CDK9 activity, we determined Pol II occupancy at target genes in SIRT7-depleted cells that overexpress CDK9/K48R or CDK9/K48Q. While decreased Pol II occupancy in SIRT7 knockdown cells could be relieved by overexpression of mutant CDK9/K48R, increased levels of the acetylation-mimicking CDK9/K48Q mutant led to a further decrease in Pol II binding (Supplementary Figure S4G). Taken together, these results uncover the mechanism underlying SIRT7-dependent activation of Pol II, demonstrating that SIRT7 enhances transcription elongation by deacetylation of lysine 48 of CDK9, which is required for CTD phosphorylation and transcription activation.",

            "text": "Although SIRT7 has emerged as a critical regulator of metabolic health and stress response, which promotes survival in times of adversity, it is the least understood member of the human sirtuin family. This is to a large extent due to its low enzymatic activity in vitro and the few molecular targets identified so far. Global proteomic studies have identified numerous SIRT7-associated proteins, most of them serving functions in transcription, ribosome biogenesis and translation (14\u201316). We have previously shown that SIRT7 is released from nucleoli in response to transcriptional, metabolic or osmotic stress, leading to hyperacetylation of PAF53 and the U3-55k protein, hyperacetylation compromising rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing (12,13). Given the vital role of SIRT7 in cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that SIRT7 function is not restricted to pre-rRNA synthesis and processing. Our mass spectrometric analyses revealed many nuclear SIRT7-associated proteins with functions in RNA metabolism, chromatin structure, nucleocytoplasmic transport and Pol II transcription, emphasizing that SIRT7 serves important roles outside the nucleolus. Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 deacetylates H3K18 in a gene-specific context, and selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac is necessary for essential features of cancer cells, including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition (11). SIRT7 was also found to interact with proteins that are associated with the Pol II and the Pol III transcription machinery (14,16). Consistent with SIRT7 interacting with TFIIIC, knockdown of SIRT7 led to decreased levels of tRNAs, indicating that the regulatory impact of SIRT7 is not restricted to Pol I transcription but affects transcription by all three classes of nuclear RNA polymerases.",

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RPB1 is modified by reversible phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation, all of which are implicated in Pol II recruitment and transcription (30,39,40). Notably, both the proteomic data and the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SIRT7 is also associated with the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb comprising CDK9 and cyclin T1. Moreover, SIRT7 was found to be associated with 7SK RNA (13) and with the 7SK-associated protein HEXIM1. Together with the observation that SIRT7 interacts with elongating Pol II and co-localizes with Pol II phosphorylated at CTD-Ser2 at SIRT7 target genes, these results suggested that reversible acetylation may regulate CDK9 kinase activity and transcription elongation. CDK9 is acetylated at two lysine residues, K44 and K48 (31\u201333). GCN5-mediated in vivo acetylation preferentially targets K48 which is essential for ATP binding and CDK9 activity. Here we show that deacetylation by SIRT7 augments the kinase activity of CDK9 which is required for CTD phosphorylation and efficient Pol II transcription. Acetylation of CDK9 has no effect on the interaction of P-TEFb with HEXIM1 or 7SK snRNA (31,32), indicating that this modification regulates P-TEFb activity independently from the inhibitor function of HEXIM1. However, we found that SIRT7-mediated deacetylation also promotes dissociation of CDK9/cyclin T1 from the inactive P-TEFb/7SK snRNP complex, suggesting that SIRT7 may target another component of the complex to release CDK9/cyclin T1.",

Based on the available data we propose the following model of P-TEFb\u2013dependent transcription activation (Figure 5). In normal cells, a significant amount of P-TEFb is sequestered in a large inactive complex containing 7SK/HEXIM1, activation requiring release from the 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex. Given that SIRT7 serves a vital role in the cellular stress response (12,13) and SIRT7 expression is linked to cell proliferation and oncogenic activity, it is not surprising that SIRT7 is connected to an emerging network of extracellular signals that control transcription of all three classes of nuclear RNA polymerases. Unraveling this network will bring important clues to the pathways that regulate gene expression in response to cell cycle progression or extracellular signaling events.",
