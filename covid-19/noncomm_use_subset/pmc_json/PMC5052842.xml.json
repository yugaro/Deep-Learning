All processes were videotaped during PPE donning and doffing. Afterward, a trained examiner reviewed all video recordings and coded timer intervals and errors. Time stamps were determined according to a 2014 CDC protocol. Each procedure was initiated when the participant picked up the equipment. The procedure ended when the next procedure was initiated. Errors were determined when the participants violated the order of procedures even with the help of their partners. For example, if a participant skipped putting on a second glove and proceeded to the next procedure, this was counted as an error. Errors during the process were explained by partners and instructors, so participants could resume the normal process.",
