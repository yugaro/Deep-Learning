This switch occurs at a specific position on the mRNA, called the slip site or slippery sequence, and can be either forwards (+1) or backwards (\u22121). The nature and efficiency of frameshifting depends on several factors, including tRNA availability and modifications, and mRNA primary and secondary structure (1,2).",

This \u2018roadblock\u2019 puts tension on the mRNA\u2013tRNA interaction. The tension can be relieved by the realigning of A-site and P-site tRNAs in the 5\u2032-direction, whereafter EF-2 can do its work and the ribosome resumes translation in the \u22121 reading frame (3).",

This difference is likely related to a higher thermodynamic stability of the pseudoknot. Indeed, from thermodynamic analysis it appears that pseudoknots are more stable than their hairpin counterparts (4\u20136). Recent studies employing mechanical \u2018pulling\u2019 of frameshifter pseudoknots have shown a correlation between the mechanical strength of a pseudoknot and its frameshifting capacity (7,8), and the influence of major groove and minor groove triplex structures (9). The higher strength of a pseudoknot can be primarily attributed to the formation of base triples between the lower stem S1 and loop L2 (Figure 1A), making it more resistant against unwinding by an elongating ribosome (8,10). Base triples in several pseudoknots, such as Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) p1\u2013p2 (11), Pea enation mosaic virus type-1 (PEMV-1) p1\u2013p2 (6), Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) p1\u2013p2 (12) and Simian retrovirus type-1 gag-pro (SRV-1) (13,14) have been shown to play an essential role in frameshifting. For pseudoknots with a longer stem S1 of 10\u201311 bp, like that of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), base triples do not appear to contribute to frameshifting (15).\n",

In addition, frameshifting in the prokaryotic dnaX gene requires, next to an upstream enhancer, the presence of a hairpin as well (19). A few studies have investigated a correlation between hairpin stability and frameshift efficiency of natural shifty hairpins (19,20). Nonetheless, certain studies have shown that a hairpin composed of the same base pairs as a frameshifter pseudoknot is not very efficient in inducing frameshifting in mammalian cells and lysates (21\u201323) but is in other systems (24).",

The 12 bp hairpin derivative of the SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-hp) showed 22% frameshifting efficiency, whereas the SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-pk) in this context yielded 31%. The pseudoknot in these experiments is a modified version of the wild-type SRV-1 pseudoknot previously used for NMR and functional analysis (14). We note that the UUUAAAC slippery sequence was used to enhance the sensitivity of the in vitro frameshifting assay. This sequence is \u223c1.5-fold more slippery than the wild-type GGGAAAC slippery sequence (28). In the latter context, the hairpin was indeed less efficient (data not shown) while a non-slippery variant, GGGAAGC, was not effective at all (<0.2%, data not shown). Two other known efficient slip sites, AAAAAAC and UUUUUUA, caused 23 and 27%, respectively, of ribosomes to switch frame in the presence of the 12 bp hairpin (data not shown). These data showed that the 12 bp hairpin is a genuine stimulator of frameshifting.",

In contrast, the same mutations in the pseudoknot context (SRV-mutpk) reduced its activity about 6-fold (Figure 1B).

We note that the UUCG tetraloop with a CG closing base pair (cbp) has higher stability (\u223c2 kcal/mol) than that with a GC cbp (31). Therefore, we first tested if this different cbp affected frameshifting efficiency. Our results showed that there is no difference in frameshifting efficiency between UUCG and UUCG/cg constructs (Figure 4, bars 6 and 8). Replacing the UUCG tetraloop by GGGC which, due to its high content of purines, is among the most disfavored tetraloops (32) had only a marginal effect on frameshifting (Figure 4, compare bars 6 and 7 and Figure 5A, lanes 1 and 4).

            "text": "Most RNA viruses that make use of ribosomal frameshifting employ pseudoknot structures instead of simple hairpins for this job. The reason for this may be the presence of a triple helix interaction between S1 and L2 in most frameshifter pseudoknots, which has been suggested to be a poor substrate for the ribosomal helicase (13,33) and hence increases ribosomal pausing and the time window for slippage. Although pausing is critical, it is not sufficient for efficient frameshifting (34). Previously, it was shown that a 17 bp hairpin with a calculated stability of \u221231.2 kcal/mol derived from the minimal IBV pseudoknot induced 5- to 10-fold less frameshifting in RRL (22) than its parent pseudoknot even though both the hairpin and the pseudoknot can pause ribosomes at the same position and to a similar extent (34). In the present study, a 12 bp hairpin derivative of the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot with a calculated stability of \u221226.9 kcal/mol was capable of inducing 22% of frameshifting, which is only 1.4-fold less than its pseudoknotted counterpart. This indicated that a non-natural hairpin can be an efficient frameshift stimulator, at least in the SRV-1 model. Furthermore, our results showed that the frameshifting efficiency increased upon elongation of the length of the hairpin up to 12\u201315 bp, which is consistent with our previous data using antisense oligonucleotides of 12\u201315 nt to induce ribosomal frameshifting (35). More importantly, the frameshift inducing ability of these hairpin constructs with a perfect stem linearly correlated with the calculated thermodynamic stability, in agreement with two previous reports (19,20).",

The dnaX gene with the highly efficient (prokaryotic) AAAAAAG slippery sequence is not directly comparable to our in vitro system; a 6 bp hairpin in the dnaX gene displayed 17% of frameshifting without upstream enhancer, whereas a 6 bp hairpin in our system induced only 3.5% of frameshifting.",

(20) observed a 15\u201320% decrease in frameshifting in vivo with their most stable hairpin, similar to our results with the 21 bp hairpin. However, in our case, the stability at which this happened was \u221245 kcal/mol much higher than their most stable hairpin of \u221222.1 kcal/mol. It is possible that this difference is due to the different experimental systems. Although it has been suggested that too stable stems increase the time for tRNAs to shift back into the 0-frame again (20) we believe that our 21 bp hairpin is less efficient because it has more AU bps in the middle of the stem compared to the 12 and 15 bp hairpins (Figure 2A). The experiments with hairpins harboring bulges or mismatches halfway through the stem demonstrated that this region is quite important for frameshifting (Figure 3A and B). Even though the overall stability of these constructs was comparable to that of a hairpin of 9 or 10 bp, their frameshift activity was equal or lower than that of a 6 bp hairpin of \u221213.1 kcal/mol: as if the mismatch or bulge after the 6th base pair disconnected the upper part of the stem. This observation is reminiscent of the overall destabilizing effect of mismatches in DNA hairpins. In a pioneer single-molecule pulling study, it was shown that introducing a mismatch in a 20 bp DNA hairpin shifted its transition state close to the location of the mismatch (36). Our data also comply with this mechanical study and suggest that mechanical stability may be a better parameter than thermodynamic stability to describe the frameshift efficiency of hairpins.",

HTLV-2 gag-pro features a perfect 10 bp hairpin with CUA tri-loop which induces 9% frameshifting in RRL (16). The CfMV 2a\u20132b frameshifting hairpin consists of 12 bp, one cytidine bulge close to the top, and a stable UACG tetraloop and is capable of inducing 11% of frameshifting in a wheat germ cell-free system (WGE) (17). What these hairpins have in common is their length of 10\u201312 bp, their relatively low number of mismatches and bulges, their small loops and their high GC content, especially in the bottom 6 bp. These features are also applicable to the good frameshifters from our dataset. Interestingly, these features do not all apply to the minimal IBV hairpin (Figure 6) that is derived from the so-called minimal IBV pseudoknot. Despite its large size of 17 bp, absence of mismatches and bulges, presence of a small loop, the stability of the middle part of the hairpin, i.e. bp 5\u20139, is not very high. This could be the reason why its activity in RRL is 5-10 fold lower (22) than of its parent pseudoknot, whose activity is 42% (25). Surprisingly, in our assays the frameshift-inducing efficiency of the IBV hairpin was 26% (data not shown), which is in stark contrast to the 4\u20138% reported by Brierley et al. (22). This discrepancy may be due to experimental conditions: in our experiments we used non-capped transcripts, a 7-nt spacer and RRL from Promega whereas the Brierley's lab used capped transcripts, a 6-nt spacer and in-house prepared RRL. On the other hand, the 26% we obtained for the IBV hairpin would be a factor of 1.6 lower than the 42% reported for the IBV pseudoknot (25), and is similar to the ratio of 1.4 and 1.6 we obtained for SRV in vitro and in vivo, respectively.\n",

An important subgroup of hairpin loops is the tetraloop, which is the most common loop size in 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs (37). The tetraloops with consensus UNCG, GNRA, or CUUG loop sequence form stable loop conformations (38,39). As opposed to the mentioned stable tetraloops, purine-rich (32) and larger loops (40) are considered to be less favorable for hairpin formation. Our results showed that the GGGC loop is indeed less efficient in inducing frameshifting but the larger loop construct (9 bp/9 nt), although having a lower thermodynamic stability, showed comparable frameshifting efficiency to the stable UUCG tetraloop hairpin. This is consistent with previous studies that showed that increasing the size of the loop in a hairpin or pseudoknot can increase frameshift-inducing ability to a certain extent (21,41). Although larger loops seem efficient in inducing frameshifting, in known examples of frameshifter hairpins, there are no loop sizes of more than 5 nt.

Combined with previous studies on antisense-induced frameshifting (43,44), these data support the notion that downstream structures primarily serve as barriers to stall translating ribosomes to stimulate frameshifting. Although there exists a linear relationship between calculated stability and frameshifting, local destabilizing elements like bulges or mismatches in a hairpin can greatly influence frameshift-inducing activity. Future experiments addressing the mechanical strength of these hairpins (7\u20139) may help to improve our understanding of the basics of ribosomal frameshifting.",
