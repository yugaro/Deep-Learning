Furthermore, hMPV is a major contributor to the burden of wintertime respiratory illness in older adults that is peak incidence at 65 years of age and immunocompromised individuals [2,4,5]. hMPV infections in children are usually mild and self-limiting, but in elderly and immunocompromised patients, the clinical course can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6]. Studies of patients with hMPV who develop severe illness have focused on children; few have involved adults [7,8]. Nosocomial infection has been reported in several studies as a mode of transmission [5,9-11].

            "text": "The mean age of the adult patients was 61.4 years, and all but five had comorbidities such as diabetes, malignancy, airway obstructive diseases, ESRD, and heart failure. Such comorbidities and old age can result in an immunocompromised state, possibly leading to the development of severe viral infections such as pneumonitis or ARDS. hMPV infections in healthy adults usually show mild clinical features from asymptomatic to upper respiratory symptoms, similar to RSV infection [18]. However, frail elderly patients with an hMPV infection could progress to pneumonitis, ARDS, or death [8,12,18]. In this study, severe hMPV infection was associated with a risk of pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in immunocompromised elderly patients. The findings of this study suggest that 20% of hospitalized adults with an hMPV infection will develop ARDS. The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was congestive heart failure. It is known that viral infection is one of the risk factors for aggravation of congestive heart failure. When patients with congestive heart failure are infected by hMPV, they have risks both aggravation of congestive heart failure and ARDS [8]. The patients with ARDS and congestive heart failure may also have had pulmonary edema; however, this could not be determined because of the limitations inherent to a retrospective study. The patients with ARDS among hMPV-infected adults showed lymphocytopenia, higher levels of BUN, creatinine, and CRP and lower levels of albumin compared to non-ARDS patients. In-hospital mortality of severe ARDS (OR, 9.48) was higher than ARDS (OR, 5.24). The in-hospital mortality rate of the patients with hMPV infection was 10.9%. The in-hospital mortality rate of the ARDS group (36.4%) was significantly higher than that of the non-ARDS group (5.7%). The risk factors for hMPV-associated ARDS should be considered as congestive heart failure. These results suggest that hMPV is an important and previously underappreciated cause of ARDS in adult patients. Severe clinical manifestations such as ARDS should be considered when hMPV infection is diagnosed in adult patients with congestive heart failure.",

Moreover, outbreaks in healthcare facilities have been reported [2,9]. When considering the implications of these findings, it should be noted that the risk of nosocomial hMPV infection is on the rise among patients with blood cancer or patients with a solid tumor [20] who were recently admitted for chemotherapy. The additional analysis showed that immunosuppressive therapy is interaction variable with cancer. A patient with liver cirrhosis was not explained as risk factor of nosocomial infection because small cases and a further research is needed. Such patients typically reside in shared rooms containing four to six patients. Therefore, the possibility of hMPV infection should be considered in long-term immunocompromised patients residing in shared rooms. Droplet respiratory precautions are appropriate for preventing the transmission of hMPV, particularly in immunocompromised patients.",
