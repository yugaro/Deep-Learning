            "text": "To investigate the genetic heterogeneity of CaKVs circulating in dogs in northeast China,\nsequence comparison and phylogeny analyses of the 36 CaKV-positive strains were conducted on\nthe basis of the partial 3D gene sequence. Genetic analysis of the partial 3D region showed\nthat the CaKVs identified in the Republic of Korea were more variable, sharing nucleotide\nsequence identities ranging from 85.1% to 99.8% [15].\nThe 36 CaKV-positive strains identified in China shared nucleotide sequence identities\nranging from 94.4% to 100% and, thus, exhibited limited genetic diversity. The phylogenetic\ntree derived from the partial 3D gene from human and various animal species showed that\nCaKVs clustered into a single lineage. This finding supports the view that CaKVs from\ndifferent countries are not restricted geographically and form a single lineage when\ncompared with kobuviruses from other species. However, the lineage of the CaKV strains\nformed three groups\u2014GI, GII and GIII\u2014and the 36 Chinese CaKV strains were divided into the\nGI and GII groups. The 35 Chinese CaKV strains in the GI group were divided into the GIa,\nGIb and GIc subgroups. All 36 Chinese CaKV strains were closely related to the CaKV\nreference strains from Asia and Europe, and they differed genetically from the CaKV\nreference strains from North America and Africa. Thus, our data suggest that the lineages of\nCaKV strains may exhibit geographically differences. This conclusion needs to be validated\nby extensive epidemiological surveying in future studies.",
