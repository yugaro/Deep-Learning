            "text": "During translation, the ribosomes have to maintain correct reading frame to faithfully decode the in-frame messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences into ordered amino acid sequences. However, specific information within mRNAs can trigger the slippage of reading frames for elongating ribosomes, and thus lead to the frameshifting events (1). In one case, the ribosomes are induced to move backward one base in the 5\u2032 direction in response to specific signals within mRNAs, and then continue translation in the new \u22121 reading frame (2). Such a \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is adopted by a variety of viruses to maintain a specific ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins (3\u20137), and examples of \u22121 PRF in cellular genes are also reported (8\u201310). The mechanism for the induction of \u22121 PRF by a stimulator is a delicate process and may involve multiple factors. Efficient eukaryotic \u22121 PRF requires two in cis RNA elements within the mRNA (11,12): a heptanucleotide slippery site of XXXYYYZ sequences, where the frameshift occurs, and a downstream RNA structure connected by a spacer. The optimal distance between stimulator and slippery site, separated by the spacer, will then position the A- and P-site tRNAs on the slippery site (13\u201315). With the sequence feature of X being any three identical nucleotides, Y being either AAA or UUU, and Z not being a G, these cooperative RNA elements can increase the probability of a ribosome to slip with A- and P-site tRNAs in the 5\u2032 direction by one base along the mRNA (from X XXY\nYYZ to XXX\nYYY Z) (15).",

            "text": "The downstream RNA stimulator is usually a hairpin-type RNA pseudoknot in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop form base pairs with a single-stranded region outside the hairpin. It leads to a quasi-continuous RNA double-helical structure, with a topology featuring two helical stems of the base-pairing region (stems 1 and 2) connected by two single-stranded loops (loops 1 and 2) (16). It is thought that the resistance of a stimulator against deformation by the ribosome helicase activity can cause the marching ribosome to pause. However, RNA hairpin not capable of stimulating \u22121 PRF also causes the ribosome to pause (13,14,17). As unwinding of stem 1 by ribosome will require rotation of the rest of the pesudoknot, torsional restraint hypothesis suggests that pseudoknot topology can restrain loop rotation during the unwinding of stem 1, and thus interferes with this process (18). Interestingly, only a subset of RNA pseudoknots can stimulate \u22121 PRF and non-pseudoknot RNA elements have been characterized to induce \u22121 PRF (19\u201321), implicating the existence of uncharacterized determinants. In addition, the involvement of specific interactions between pseudoknot stimulator and ribosomal components during the unwinding process cannot be ruled out (22,23).",

            "text": "Based on the length of stem 1, the RNA pseudoknots capable of stimulating \u22121 PRF can be classified into two groups. One group of pseudoknot requires a long stem 1 to stimulate \u22121 PRF efficiently and can be represented by the infectious bronchitis virus pseudoknot (IBV-PK), which contains 11 bp in stem 1. Deviation from the optimal 11\u201312 bp in stem 1 will lead to the impairment of IBV-PK frameshift efficiency (24). However, no high-resolution structural information is available for this class of pseudoknot. In contrast, the other group of pseudoknots, which includes mouse mammary tumor virus pseudoknot (MMTV-PK), beet western yellow virus (BWYV-PK) and simian retrovirus pseudoknot (SRV-PK), has a short stem 1 of <7 bp in length (16). The analysis of high-resolution structures of several short stem 1 possessing pseudoknots indicated that they all share a common structural feature, involving tertiary loop-helix interactions (between stem 1 and loop 2) close to the helical junction (22,25\u201328). The requirement of these tertiary interactions in \u22121 PRF activity has been verified by mutagenesis analysis (29\u201332). However, the relative small size of this group of pseudoknots makes it difficult to rationalize the results of extensive mutagenesis analysis because a mutant may not necessarily still form a pseudoknot. Furthermore, NMR structures of a luteoviral pseudoknot and its poorly functional variant suggest that both pseudoknots possess essentially identical global structure (27,28). Therefore, how structurally similar pseudoknots produce distinct \u22121 PRF efficiency remains an open question.",

            "text": "Here, we demonstrate that an RNA pseudoknot, hTPK-DU177 (DU177), which is derived from human telomerase RNA (33,34), can function as an efficient \u22121 PRF stimulator. Because well-characterized \u22121 PRF pseudoknots containing short stem 1 all possess relative short loop 1 (22,25\u201328), information for the contribution of loop 1\u2013stem 2 interactions to \u22121 PRF activity of a pseudoknot is limited (18). Therefore, the long loop 1 of DU177 and its extensive stem\u2013loop interactions with the stem 2 make this well-defined pseudoknot an excellent model to explore this issue. Using DU177 and its variants, we show that the \u22121 PRF efficiency of DU177 can be impaired by the disruption of specific base\u2013triple interactions flanking the helical junction region. In contrast, a DU177 mutant, lacking most of the triple interactions identified in DU177, has essentially no frameshift activity but still adopts a pseudoknot conformation. Furthermore, the triplex in DU177 is then mimicked and constructed intermolecularly (35), and is used to decouple triplex formation from pseudoknot topology to resolve their roles in \u22121 PRF activity. Therefore, our work provides a platform to characterize the contributions of two structural determinants of a \u22121 PRF pseudoknot. Finally, the results from this work also imply that a non-coding RNA may act in-trans to stimulate \u22121 PRF on targeted mRNAs by specific intermolecular triplex formation.",

Furthermore, both PEMV-1 PK and DU177 contain an unusual Hoogsteen AU base pair, formed between loops 1 and 2, to bridge the helical junction. We thus examined if DU177 could function as a \u22121 PRF stimulator when it is positioned downstream of a slippery sequence. To this end, the \u22121 PRF activity of DU177 was measured and compared with those of several well-characterized pseudoknot stimulators available in our laboratory. The results, shown in Figure 1G, indicate that DU177 can act as an efficient \u22121 PRF stimulator in vitro. The \u22121 PRF efficiency stimulated by DU177 was comparable with that of the minimal IBV pseudoknot (IBVm-PK) and was in the range of 50%. This value was higher than those of MMTV-PK (24%) and the other two AACAA-containing pseudoknots, BWYV-PK and SRV-PK (21% and 34%, respectively). In addition, DU177 possessed substantial \u22121 PRF activity in vivo (data not shown). Therefore, the high \u22121 PRF activity and the well-resolved structure of DU177 make it a good model molecule for dissecting the structural determinants within a pseudoknot for the stimulation of \u22121 PRF.\n",

Analysis of non-denatured gel confirmed that both RNA constructs adopt a major conformation (Figure 3A). However, distinct gel mobility of these two RNAs suggested that they might have different conformations. The enzymatic probing data are shown and summarized in Figure 3B\u2013E. We used DU177 RNA as the standard for comparison because its NMR structure is well defined (33). For both DU177 and CCC/GU RNAs, the distributions of cleavage patterns by ribonuclease T2, the probe for single-stranded region, are in agreement with the formation of the two loop regions. In addition, the distributions of cleavage patterns by RNase V1, the probe for duplex and stacked conformations, can be localized to the two predicted stem regions for both RNAs. Specifically, both RNAs possess signature V1 cleavage for the quasi-continuous helical region corresponding to the 3\u2032-portion of stem 1 and the 5\u2032-portion of stem 2 (Figure 3B,D). Therefore, these probing data indicate that CCC/GU RNA also adopts a pseudoknot conformation and suggest that the other mutants containing more base triples should also adopt the pseudoknot conformations. In the related UV-melting and single-molecule mechanical unfolding experiments for DU177 and CCC/GU RNAs, transitions corresponding to the melting or mechanical unfolding of stems 1 and 2 were also observed and are consistent with the probing data (33,38). In addition, an extra transition corresponding to the disruption of tertiary interaction network was also reported in single-molecule unfolding studies and can only be observed in DU177 RNA (38). Taken together with the mutagenesis studies above, the results of these experiments suggest that DU177 RNA can be converted into a \u22121 PRF-incompetent pseudoknot by disruption of the triplex structure spanning the helical junction.\n",

As shown in Figure 4B, a dramatic reduction of \u22121 PRF activity to \u223c10% can be observed for mutants U100C, U101C, A171G and A172U, whereas mutant U102C possesses a \u22121 PRF efficiency of 33% (Figure 4B, lanes 1\u20135). Therefore, the stem\u2013loop interactions flanking the helical junction, contributed by the first two base triples of both stems, are crucial for efficient \u22121 PRF activity. In contrast, the stem\u2013loop interactions from the distal third major-groove triple (U113-A176\u00b7U102) are less important. During the progress of this work, an extra major-groove base\u2013triple was proposed in the refined DU177 structure (34). It locates next to the distal third triple, and its formation will be blocked in the L1-ACA mutant created in Figure 2. Both DU177 and L1-ACA having similar \u22121PRF efficiencies (compare lane 1 with lane 6 in Figure 2B) further support the idea that the contribution of a major-groove triple in \u22121 PRF activity of DU177 also depends on its relative position to the helical junction.\n",

The frameshift activities range from 49% for 176W to 22 and 14% for 175W and 174W, respectively. Therefore, mutation on the stem base pair of the distal third major-groove triple, 176W, has less impact on \u22121 PRF activity than those of the two junction-flanking major-groove triples. Finally, mutating the U of C\u2013G \u00b7 U triple (174W or 175W) to the C, thus forming a C\u2013G \u00b7 C triple (174T or 175T), can restore frameshift efficiency to the level of DU177.

Indeed, UV-melting experiments on a bimolecular pseudoknot have indicated that the triplex formation is independent of loop closure embedded in the pseudoknot topology (33). Because of the dominant role of triplex formation in the \u22121 PRF activity of DU177 revealed above, we used a similar bimolecular pesudoknot approach to examine the contribution of pseudoknot topology to the \u22121 PRF activity of DU177. In this approach, the 5\u2032-hairpin portion of DU177 was used to replace the DU177 pseudoknot in the reporter mRNA to form the hTR-5\u2032hp construct, and an in-trans hTR3\u2032ss RNA corresponding to the loop 2 and the 3\u2032 portion of stem 2 in DU177 was constructed separately (Figure 5A). Based on the results from previous UV-melting experiments (33), the association of hTR3\u2032ss RNA with hTR\u20135\u2032hp construct will restore stem 2 and all the triple interactions corresponding to those in the DU177. The bimolecular pseudoknot construct will thus resemble the unimolecular DU177, except for it missing the covalent linkage that connects stem 1 and loop 2. The results shown in Figure 5B indicate that, upon the addition of hTR3\u2032ss RNA, the \u22121 PRF efficiency of 5\u2032-hairpin-containing mRNA reporter (hTR-5\u2032hp) changes from 0.25 to 5% in a dosage-dependent way. In contrast, a control mRNA reporter, hTR5\u2032hp-L1c, designed to disrupt a potential intermolecular major-groove base\u2013triple interactions, does not respond to even a higher dosage of hTR3\u2032ss RNA. Similarly, in-trans oligo-nucleotides (171G3\u2032ss and 172U3\u2032ss RNA), designed to disrupt potential intermolecular minor-groove base\u2013triple interactions, cannot induce significant \u22121 PRF activity on hTR5\u2032hp mRNA reporter, either (Figure 5C). Finally, we also examined if an intermolecular U\u2013A \u00b7 U major-groove base\u2013triple interaction can be replaced by an intermolecular C\u2013G \u00b7 C triple. As shown in Figure 6, 174T3\u2032ss RNA, designed to form a C\u2013G \u00b7 C triple with 174T5\u2032hp mRNA reporter, can stimulate significant \u22121 PRF activity on 174T5\u2032hp reporter only, but not on hTR5\u2032hp or hTR5\u2032hp-L1c reporter. Therefore, an intermolecular triplex mimicking the triplex structure spanning the helical junction of DU177, although it does not possess a completed pseudoknot topology, can stimulate \u22121 PRF activity. Together with the observation that the removal of the continuing triplex structure converts DU177 into a \u22121 PRF incompetent pseudoknot, these experimental results argue that both the pseudoknot topology and the triplex structure are required for high-efficiency of \u22121 PRF, with the pseudoknot topology playing an enhancer-like role to further increase \u22121 PRF efficiency.\n\n",

The studies on \u22121 PRF pseudoknots containing short stem 1, such as BWYV-PK and ScYLV-PK, indicated that specific minor-groove base triples involving S1 and L2 are important for \u22121 PRF activity, and the impact on frameshift efficiency depends on their relative position to the helical junction (27,28,30,31). Particularly, it has been shown that junction-flanking tertiary interactions between the 3\u2032-nucleotide of loop 2 and base pairing in stem 1 can organize an interhelical interaction network that may act as a kinetic barrier during the unfolding of pseudoknot by ribosome (28). In contrast, the roles of loop 1 and stem 2 in a \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulator are less addressed as both BWYV-PK and ScYLV-PK have short loop 1 and stem 2 (18). In this work, we reveal that the major-groove base\u2013triple interactions closer to the helical junction are more important than the distal ones for \u22121 PRF activity of DU177 (Figures 2B and 4B). Therefore, the relative position toward the helical junction is important for both major- and minor-groove base\u2013triple in determining the contribution of a base\u2013triple to the \u22121 PRF stimulation activity of a pseudoknot. This position-dependent effect can be rationalized by the stabilization of stem 2 by stem\u2013loop interactions, and the anchoring of stem 2 into stem 1 via the junction bridging triplex formation. Such interactions will provide extra restraints during the unwinding of stem 1 by ribosome and are consistent with the torsional restraint hypothesis (18).",

Indeed, modulation of frameshift efficiency by the modification of junction geometry via tertiary interactions has been observed in the helical junction of MMTV-PK and BWYV-PK (29,30). In particular, the DU177 pseudoknot also adopts a bent conformation around the helical junction (33,34), and the tertiary stem\u2013loop interactions contributed by the junction-flanking base triples may thus play a unique role to facilitate this bending process. Alternatively, the single-molecule unfolding analysis of a set of DU177 variants, with \u22121 PRF efficiency ranging from 50 to 0%, reveals a correlation between pseudoknot mechanical stability and frameshift efficiency (38). Building upon this foundation, the position effect of stem\u2013loop interaction on the mechanical stability of a pseudoknot can be analyzed further in the future.",

In these cases, the pseudoknot topology may just serve to hold the structural determinants of \u22121 PRF activity together within the same molecule. With loops crossing the grooves of stems under the pseudoknot topology, an interlocked helical junction can be efficiently generated by the junction-flanking stem\u2013loop interactions, and thus restrict the rotational flexibility between stems 2 and 1 as proposed in the torsional restraint hypothesis (18). In addition, the loop 2 to stem 1 adenine stacking interactions described above can be put in place easily. Alternatively, the fact that most \u22121 PRF competent pseudoknots possess a short loop 1, thus creating strains (40), argues for a more active role for the loop-closure constraint imposed by a pseudoknot. In fact, the bimolecular pseudoknot construct still maintains one of the two constrained loops seen in DU177, and the intact DU177 indeed has a much higher \u22121 PRF efficiency than that of the bimolecular pseudoknot. This can explain why removing one loop-closure constraint from DU177 can reduce its \u22121 PRF efficiency dramatically, and thus underscores the importance of pseudoknot topology in \u22121 PRF. In agreement with this work, designed RNA\u2013DNA hybrids, with loop\u2013loop interaction between mRNA and in-trans DNA hairpin to mimick rotational restraints imposed by pseudoknot topology, have been shown to stimulate \u22121 PRF significantly (18).",

            "text": "It is intriguing that an RNA motif derived from the RNA component of telomerase can act as a \u22121 PRF stimulator. This could be explained by the existence of a common structural feature such as a specific RNA-protein contact, which is needed for a telomerase as well as a \u22121 PRF stimulator to function properly. Interestingly, telomerase RNA subunit has been identified in Marek\u2019s disease virus (41). Perhaps, different viruses might pick up this motif during evolution and modified it to fit replication purpose, including the tuning of \u22121 PRF efficiency through mutation (30). Nevertheless, it is informative to note that specific 2\u2032OH groups protruding from the triple helix of DU177 have been shown to contact with the protein component of telomerase (42). Therefore, the bimolecular pseudoknot provides a workable platform to explore the possibility of specific stimulator-ribosomal helicase interaction during \u22121 PRF as suggested previously (22). In addition, it should be useful in probing the geometry of the mRNA entry channel and the helicase activity of eukaryotic ribosomes. Finally, the regulation of \u22121 PRF in-trans shown here raises the possibility that non-coding RNA may use a similar mechanism to regulate gene expression although the \u22121 PRF efficiency observed here is not dramatic compared with the reported examples (20,21). However, further enhancement of frameshift efficiency for application purpose is possible, such as that demonstrated by the use of modified oligonucleotides (20).",
