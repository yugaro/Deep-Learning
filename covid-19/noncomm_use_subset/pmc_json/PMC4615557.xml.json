Eukaryotic enzymes catalyze this reaction in the nucleus. Many viruses, however, replicate in the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic host, and the cellular capping machinery is not accessible for their RNAs; hence, these viruses have evolved their own capping enzymes to form a cap structure that can be recognized by the cellular translation machinery for gene expression. Examples include Flaviviridae, Nidovirales, Mononegavirales and Poxviridae (reviewed in ref. 12). While the cellular and viral mRNA capping apparatus is functionally similar, the enzyme organization differs greatly across evolution.",

Abd1 is a founding member of a protein family that is strongly conserved in eukaryotes as well as in viruses.24 The crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Abd1 itself could not be determined, but eventually it was solved for its homolog, the Ecm1 protein from E. cuniculi (Fig. 2).25 Purified Ecm1 is a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer to GpppRNA to form cap0, but also to free mononucleotides GTP, GDP or dGTP (deoxy-GTP). The methyltransferase domain in Ecm1, and by inference also in other homologous cap0 methyltransferases, exhibits the RFM fold with a characteristic insertion that forms a characteristic \u03b2-meander structure involved in the formation of the cap-binding site. This insertion is common between methyltransferases that methylate G to m7G in the RNA cap, and methyltransferases that N-methylate the amino acid glycine. This relationship between 2 different types of methyltransferases, as well as the cap0 methyltransferase structure, were correctly predicted using bioinformatics24 before the first structure of the cap0 methyltransferase was determined.\n\n",

VP39 is a single-domain protein with additional structural elements at both the N- and C-termini, which wrap around the RFM core and form a binding pocket for the cap. In the ternary complex, the m7G base of the cap is bound sandwiched between 2 aromatic side chains, and oriented in such a way that the Hoogsteen edge modified by addition of the methyl group on N7 faces the protein, thus explaining the ability of VP39 to sense the methylation status of the substrate, which is the basis of its preference for substrates that already have an N7-methylated cap.",

Interestingly, while the cofactor-binding sites, active sites, and the sites of binding of the nascent RNA chain exhibits similarities with the VP39 and CMTr1 enzymes (and likewise the conformations of the respective ligands), their cap-binding sites exhibit large differences in the shape of the m7G-binding pocket. As a result, CMTr1 binds m7G in a different way, in which the sugar edge of the cap guanosine faces the protein, and the methyl group on N7 faces the solvent (Fig. 3). These structural differences explain why CMTr1 is relatively insensitive to the absence of cap0 methylation and therefore is able to act, at least in vitro, on substrates with unmethylated guanosine.\n\n",

The cap2 methyltransferase has been characterized in T. brucei (TbMTr244,45) and in humans (CMTr246). Interestingly, while CMTr2 appears to be closely related to its human paralog CMTr1 as well as to TbMTr1, TbMTr2 is more closely related to the vaccinia virus cap1 methyltransferase.44 In trypanosomes, a third 2\u2032-O-ribose cap methyltransferase was identified and termed TbMTr3, which is responsible for the methylation of the third residue of the cap and is required for the methylation of the fourth residue.47,48 TbMTr3 is a close relative of TbMTr2 and of VP39, and is only remotely related to other eukaryotic cap 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferases, which suggests that trypanosomes acquired enzymes for \u201cadditional\u201d methylation by adapting proteins from viruses. A phylogenetic study of 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferases revealed that the relationships between cellular and viral enzymes are quite complex, and that these proteins can vary greatly in number even in closely-related organisms.

For instance, in the human reovirus (a virus with a dsRNA genome), the cap structure formation is catalyzed by a large multidomain protein lambda 2, which in turn is a part of the reovirus core: an assembly with a relative molecular mass of 52 MDa that synthesizes, modifies and exports viral mRNA. The structure of the human reovirus core has been solved at low resolution, revealing a series of domains that include a putative guanylyltransferase domain and 2 putative methyltransferase (RFM) domains.49 It has been suggested that the order of the domains in the lambda 2 protein corresponds to the order of the capping reactions: guanosine transfer followed by cap0 and cap1 methylation. However, comparison of domain structures suggested that the functional assignments may be different, as the RFM domain 1 shared a putative active site with the corresponding structurally characterized 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferases, including the cap1 methyltransferase, whereas the RFM domain 2 exhibited structural similarity to the cap0 methyltransferases.50 It should be noted that the putative cap1 methyltransferase domain of reovirus exhibits a similar cap-binding platform formed by N- and C-terminal extensions, as in VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes; however, its putative m7G-binding site is more open.",

Bioinformatics analyses predicted that the Tgs enzymes are related to a large group of RFM enzymes that act on exocyclic amine groups in nucleic acid bases, including m6A, m4C, and m2G and have a characteristic NPPY-like motif at the active site.66 The crystal structure of the active C-terminal methyltransferase domain of the human TGS enzyme bound to a minimal substrate m7GTP as well as the reaction product SAH has been reported, confirming these predictions and revealing the atomic details of these protein-ligand interactions.69,70\n\n",

While the cap0 and cap1 methyltransferases in trypanosomes are relatively closely related to their human counterparts, bioinformatics analyses identified cap2 and cap3/4 methyltransferases as close homologs of the vaccinia virus cap1 methyltransferase. While the analysis of protein-RNA interactions and search for potential regulatory molecules (e.g., inhibitors) could be guided by homology models developed so far,47 experimental determination of high resolution structures for cap methyltransferases in trypanosomes would be definitely useful.",

Some of the prominent enzymatic activities known to exist that are still awaiting unequivocal identification of the corresponding proteins include m6A methylation of the first transcribed nucleoside of capped RNAs in humans, and m6,6A and m3U methylation of the first and the fourth residues in the cap4 structure in capped RNAs in trypanosomes. A comprehensive biochemical and structural characterization of these enzymes could further contribute to the possibility of developing new drugs against trypanosomal parasites and new tools to study RNA metabolism in human cells.",
