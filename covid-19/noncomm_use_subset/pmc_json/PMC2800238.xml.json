The viral enzyme complex contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as its core catalytic subunit for the production of negative strand RNA (\u2013RNA), new genome molecules and in many virus groups also subgenomic (sg) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1,3).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of +RNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and various respiratory infections caused by less-virulent family members (4). The group is also known for its exceptionally large polycistronic genome of \u223c30 kb, which is 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated RNA. The 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the CoV genome (open reading frames 1a and 1b) are translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The 3\u2032-proximal third encodes the viral structural proteins and several so-called accessory proteins, which can only be expressed following the production of a set of four to nine sg mRNAs (5,6). In particular, it is this CoV hallmark that has attracted attention over the years, since these sg mRNAs consist of sequences that are noncontiguous in the viral genome: a common 5\u2032 leader sequence is attached to body segments representing a variable part of the 3\u2032-proximal genomic region. According to the now widely supported transcription model of Sawicki and Sawicki (7), the arterivirus and CoV sg RNAs derive from a discontinuous step during minus-strand RNA synthesis that is guided by specific RNA signals and resembles copy-choice RNA recombination (5,6,8). This mechanism produces a set of subgenome-length negative-strand templates from which the sg mRNAs are produced. The unusual genome size of CoVs and the complexity of their RNA synthesis hint at an RdRp that may have special properties, either by itself or in conjunction with other subunits of the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC).",

            "text": "CoV replication and transcription are driven by the 15 or 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) encoded in the replicase gene, which include many enzyme activities that are rare or lacking in other families of +RNA viruses (9,10). These nsps are produced during co- and post-translational processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins by two or three internal viral proteinases (11). In the years following the 2003 SARS outbreak, bioinformatics, structural biology, (reverse) genetics and biochemical studies have all contributed to the in-depth characterization of CoV nsps in general and those of SARS-CoV in particular (9,10,12). Currently documented enzyme activities include proteinases (11), a putative RNA primase (13), a superfamily 1 helicase (14), an exo- and an endoribonuclease (15,16), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)-binding proteins (17,18) and two methyltransferases (19,20). Following the sequence analysis of the first CoV genomes, more than two decades ago, the putative RdRp domain of the coronavirus RTC had already been identified by comparative sequence analysis (21,22). The C-terminal, two-thirds of the 932-amino-acid subunit, now known as nsp12 was confidently aligned with the conserved motifs of well-known RdRps (22,23). In view of its unprecedented size among viral RdRp subunits, which commonly consist of 500\u2013600 amino acids, nsp12 may well harbor other functional domains in its as-yet uncharacterized N-terminal domain. Biochemical information on the CoV RdRp has, however, remained scarce thus far, particularly since full-length nsp12 was refractory to expression in bacterial systems. Preliminary evidence for the in vitro RdRp activity of nsp12 came from a study of the SARS-CoV enzyme by Cheng et al. (24). However, their experiments, employing a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-nsp12 fusion protein, were hampered by protein instability, which resulted in the fragmentation of the protein into three parts. Primer-dependent activity on poly(A) templates was observed in filter binding assays, but the enzyme biochemistry was not further characterized in detail.",

We therefore sought to solve the technical issues described above and develop reliable protocols for stable expression, purification and in vitro activity of the full-length CoV nsp12. In this article, we describe an expression strategy utilizing in vivo cleavage in a bacterial expression system by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Ubp1), which releases the small N-terminal fusion partner ubiquitin (Ub) and generates a recombinant nsp12 protein containing its natural N-terminus. This was found to be a critical step on the road toward purification of a stable recombinant SARS-CoV RdRp. We subsequently established that full-length nsp12 can readily synthesize RNA in a primer-dependent fashion on both homo- and heteropolymeric RNA templates and is also efficient at incorporating deoxy-nucleotides on a DNA template. This work therefore provides a solid basis for the further biochemical characterization of the coronavirus nsp12 and the detailed dissection of its role in viral replication and transcription. Understanding the enzyme\u2019s properties will be essential for the development of selective coronavirus RdRp inhibitors and will likely provide novel insights into the intriguing (evolutionary) relation between the RdRp of nidoviruses and other groups of +RNA viruses.",

For our study, the nsp12-coding region was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the genome of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 (AY291315). During amplification, the ORF1a/1b \u22121 ribosomal frameshift near the 5\u2032-end of the gene was corrected in a translationally silent manner. Primers used for amplification were SAV424 5\u2032-GCGGGTACCCCGCGGTGGATCTGCGGATGCATCAA-3\u2032 and SAV425 5\u2032-GCGCGATCGGGATCCCTGCAAGACTGTATGT-3\u2032, corresponding to SARS-CoV genome positions 13 327\u201313 387 and 16 152\u201316 166, respectively. The PCR amplicon was digested with SacII and BamHI, and ligated into expression vector pET26-Ub-CHis6 (26). Following confirmation of the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon and using the flanking XbaI and XhoI restriction sites, the ubiquitin-nsp12-His6 fusion gene (Ub-nsp12-CHis6) was subcloned into vector pASK3 (IBA) and thereby placed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. This ruled out the known risk of potential contamination with T7 RNA polymerase, as it can occur when using a T7 promoter to drive expression of other RdRps in bacterial expression systems. Nsp12 active-site mutant D618A, carrying an Asp618Ala substitution, was engineered via site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene), using primers SAV526 5\u2032-CCTTATGGGTTGGGCTTATCCAAAATGTG-3\u2032 and SAV527 5\u2032-CACATTTTGGATAAGCCCAACCCATAAGGA-3\u2032.",

To avoid the known risk of T7 RNA polymerase contamination when purifying another RdRp using a T7 promoter-driven expression system [like E. coli BL21(DE3)], the Ub-nsp12-CHis6 fusion gene was subsequently transferred to plasmid pASK3, placing it under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Initially, the protease that was later used to remove the Ub tag was not co-expressed and the expression of the full-length Ub-tagged nsp12-CHis6 was compared to that of variants containing either maltose binding protein (MBP) or thioredoxin (Thio) as fusion partner. As shown in Figure 1B and as also documented in the previous work of Cheng et al. (24), expression and purification of nsp12 fusion proteins resulted in the abundant and progressive fragmentation of the protein. Based on their sizes in SDS\u2013PAGE, the cleavage products likely were the 64- and 39-kDa nsp12 degradation products as found by Cheng et al. (24) when working with their GST-nsp12 fusion construct (Figure 1B).

Structural studies subsequently revealed that a native N-terminus is required for the proper folding of the RdRp\u2019s \u2018fingers\u2019 subdomain and the positioning of the 3Dpol active site (30). These findings suggested to us that N-terminal additions might also hamper the proper folding of the SARS-CoV RdRp and could thus be the principal cause of its subsequent degradation. We therefore co-expressed the C-terminal Ub protease Ubp1 (26), which specifically recognizes the cleavage site in our fusion protein that is located between the Ub moiety and the N-terminus of nsp12 (LRGG\u2193SADAS). Proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein at this site liberated an nsp12-CHis6 product (Figure 1A), now containing its natural N-terminus. The expression of the Ubp1 protease was driven by the relatively weak constitutive ADH1 promoter (26). Hence, to ensure optimal release of nsp12-CHis6 by the protease, induction of Ub-nsp12-CHis6 expression was performed only in the middle or late log-phase of bacterial growth. Induction at lower densities or on-column cleavages performed with the cleavable MBP and Thio fusion proteins resulted in significant amounts of degraded nsp12, which was inactive in RdRp assays (data not shown).",

            "text": "+RNA virus replication may proceed through a variety of scenarios, but essentially viral RdRps employ only two fundamentally different mechanisms during the first step of RNA synthesis: initiation can occur either de novo, when the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide essentially is the \u2018primer\u2019 to which a second nucleotide is added, or initiation can depend on an oligonucleotide or protein primer (32). Imbert et al. (13) recently showed that the CoV nsp8 subunit, a relatively small protein (22 kDa) that forms a hexadecameric complex with nsp7 (33), can synthesize short oligonucleotides using poly(C) templates or templates containing a 3\u2032 CCG/U motif. Although the exact role of nsp8 remains to be studied in much more detail, one of its proposed functions is that of an \u2018RNA primase\u2019 (13). According to this hypothesis, and similar to what has been documented for cellular DNA polymerases (34), the oligonucleotide products of nsp8 activity would serve as primers for the viral \u2018main RdRp\u2019, i.e. nsp12. Some other observations were also consistent with the possibility that the SARS-CoV main RdRp belongs to the class of primer-dependent polymerases. First, modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV nsp12 residues 400\u2013900 suggested that the central domain of the protein contains a G motif, a signature present in all primer-dependent RdRps (23). Second, when using the unstable GST-nsp12 fusion protein in combination with a poly(A) template and a poly(U) primer, Cheng et al. (24) observed a moderate RdRp activity in filter-binding assays. Convincing evidence for the extension of an RNA primer in vitro, however, has not been documented thus far.",

In other viral RdRps, single or multiple substitutions of the equivalent residues with alanine or asparagine were shown to change or even abolish polymerase activity (38,39), depending on the assay conditions used. For the PV 3Dpol, for example, it was found that mutagenesis of the motif C core sequence, changing it from GDD to GDN, was detrimental in the presence of Mg2+, but not when Mn2+ or Fe2+ were provided as divalent cation (38). To obtain an active site mutant that could be used as negative control during further development of our assays, we engineered nsp12 mutant D618A. As portrayed in Figure 2B and C, the mutant protein displayed only 8 \u00b1 3% residual primer extension activity in our assays (Figure 2B\u2013D), thus confirming the nsp12-specific nature of the RdRp activity described here and supporting the prior hypothesis that this residue is a key player in the enzyme\u2019s active site. Further or complete knockdown of activity may be obtained under slightly different assay conditions or in combination with substitution of other active site residues, which remain to be tested in future studies.",

However, a more detailed analysis revealed that this increase largely stemmed from enhanced initiation of primer extension rather than elongation, with the latter being decreased by 35% as judged from the amount of full-length product (primer + 10, Figure 3B). Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed at 30\u00b0C. Contrary to expectations however, the major extension product never matched the length of the primer plus 10 nt, suggesting that nsp12 generally terminates before reaching the end of the primed poly(U) template.

Higher concentrations (\u226520 mM) ultimately abolished activity (data not shown). The SARS-CoV RdRp does not require Mn2+ for RNA synthesis, as previously reported for the nsp9-RdRp of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), a distant relative in the order Nidovirales (37). In fact, the presence of Mn2+ in an RdRp assay utilizing a poly(U) template decreased the fidelity of the SARS-CoV nsp12 relative to Mg2+ and facilitated both transversional and transitional misincorporations (Figure 4). The specificity for the nucleotide\u2019s sugar moiety seemed not affected, however, since deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) was not incorporated when using an RNA template in the presence of Mn2+.

Furthermore, following the basic characterization of individual enzymes, the interplay with templates, cofactors and other subunits of the viral enzyme complex can be addressed. Ultimately, this should facilitate the in vitro reconstitution of the holo-enzyme complex and the analysis of its interactions at each step of viral replication and transcription. After the purification of active SARS-CoV nsp12 and exploration of the reaction conditions, our subsequent step toward such a future goal was to evaluate the rate of nucleotide incorporation by the SARS-CoV RdRp. On a primed U10 template we found relatively poor incorporation rates (1.2 \u00b1 0.4 nM/min) and a major product that was 2\u20133 nt shorter than the expected full-length product (Figure 6A), with product sizes displaying a similar Gaussian-like distribution as depicted in the graphs in Figure 3. On the other hand, we also observed minor products that were slightly longer than full length, suggesting slippage of the polymerase at the end of the template. We did not detect any terminal transferase activity on the templates used (data not shown).\n",

To test whether nsp12 was able to incorporate [\u03b1-32P] deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP) when using DNA templates, we employed a primed T10 template similar to the RNA templates described above. As shown in Figure 6B, nsp12 was capable of incorporating dAMP when incubated with a DNA template. On average, a minor reduction (\u223c20%) in dAMP incorporation was observed in comparison to the activity on an RNA template. The size distribution of products was more different, and showed significantly less initiation than on an RNA template (compare Figure 6A and B).",

When the primed poly(U) template was changed to a primed heteromeric (CU)10, nsp12 activity increased further (V(CU)10 = 45 \u00b1 2 nM/min) and reached a level comparable to that obtained for other viral RdRps on similar short templates (40). When the products of the latter reactions were resolved by denaturing PAGE (Figure 6D) they were found to be longer than template length. Similar products extending beyond unit length have been often observed when short templates were used for PV 3Dpol (43) and their generation can be explained by various mechanisms, such as distributive slippage, processive slippage, template switching or terminal transferase activity (43 and references therein). Future research is expected to address these mechanisms in more detail.\n",

We found that even a single-step purification scheme could produce an enzyme preparation that combined specific activity with reasonable purity (>80\u201385%). Of particular importance in our expression protocol was the co-expression of the Ubp1 protease that mediated the in vivo removal of the N-terminal Ub tag (Figure 1A) (26). Apparently, similar to PV 3Dpol (30), SARS-CoV RdRp does not tolerate additional amino acids at its N-terminus, likely because they induce an unstable and largely inactive fold. Because of the observed sensitivity to N-terminal fusions, it is tempting to speculate that the processing of the pp1ab cleavage generating the nsp12 N-terminus is of great importance for proper folding and activity in vivo as well. In line with this notion, it was reported that for the related group 2 CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) this cleavage site indeed is indispensable for virus replication (44). It still remains to be tested whether there is any effect of the C-terminal His-tag on the activity of the enzyme used in this study.",

Previously, the PV and HCV RdRps were demonstrated to bind RNA with Kd values of 2\u201310 \u03bcM (45) and \u223c3 \u03bcM (46), respectively. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV nsp12 binds RNA with slightly higher affinity for both dsRNA and ssRNA (Kd \u223c 0.1 \u03bcM). The relatively similar affinities for dsRNA and ssRNA suggest that the lack of de novo initiation may largely be due to a relatively open structure and the absence of a conserved priming loop in the predicted thumb subdomain (23). The latter structural element, a \u03b2-hairpin in, e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B, is present in many known de novo initiating RNA polymerases. Canonically, it functions by partly obstructing the template binding cleft and is believed to be essential for association with the single-stranded 3\u2032 end of the template RNA (23,47,48).",

This in vivo cleavage created the native nsp12 amino-terminus with the sequence SADAS. (B) Western blotting using an nsp12-specific polyclonal antiserum identified a single band of the expected mass after purification of the in vivo cleaved expression product. Isolation of fusion proteins with different N-terminal tags resulted in common patterns of degradation. Similar results were reported by Cheng et al. (24) for a GST-nsp12 fusion protein.

(C) A primer extension assay using a 5\u2032 32P-labeled primer and ATP confirmed that wild-type nsp12, in contrast to the D618A mutant, was able to elongate the 20-mer primer. The slight reduction of input primer in the D618A lane probably resulted from degradation by RNase activity. The D618A mutant showed 8 \u00b1 3% residual activity (mean of three independent experiments). In the loading control (Figure 2B and C, lower panels) the two nsp12 variants were visualized by silver staining of an SDS\u2013PAGE gel.",

Subsequently, after 10 min, different unlabeled nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM to allow elongation for another 30 min. (B) SARS-CoV nsp12 allows only limited transversional and transitional misincorporations. Interestingly, also in the presence of dATP no significant activity was observed, implying that the SARS-CoV RdRp is capable of discriminating between ATP and dATP.

(A) Reactions with 0.1 \u03bcM nsp12, 1 \u03bcM template and 50 \u03bcM ATP were followed over time and quenched with 50 mM EDTA at the time points indicated. Gel analysis showed that, similar to the curves in Figure 3, the major accumulating product is the primer (p) extended by 7 nt (i.e. p + 7) and not the expected full-length product of n + 10. (B) To assess whether nsp12 was capable of DNA-templated incorporation of dATP, reactions were performed as in Figure 6A, but now using a DNA template. The time course illustrates robust [\u03b1-32P]dAMP incorporation, implying that the SARS-CoV RdRp is able to utilize both RNA and DNA templates. The incorporation of dAMP was 20% lower than that of AMP on an RNA template. (C) Time courses were additionally performed using an RNA template containing a U20 template region. Similar to the shorter 10-nt template used in Figure 6A, the major product here was around 2 nt shorter than the expected full-length product. (D) Changing the single-stranded template from U20 to a heteromeric (CU)10 not only increased the nucleotide incorporation rate by 34%, but also the behavior of nsp12 on the template. Products of the expected full-length size (p + 20) were observed, but also products longer than the template, hinting at, e.g. template switching by nsp12. Future research will address this observation in more detail. In this reaction both 50 \u03bcM ATP and GTP were present. The gel image represents the top half of a 20% denaturing PAGE gel.",
