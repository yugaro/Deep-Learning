Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequence\nanalyses, the causal virus was classified as a new genus (the genus\nkobuvirus) in the family Picornaviridae and named the Aichi\nvirus [30, 31].\nKobuviruses are non-enveloped, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses, and have been\nisolated from samples obtained from a variety of mammals. Genetically, it is classified into\nthree strains, termed Aichivirus A (formerly Aichi virus), B (formerly bovine kobuvirus) and C\n(formerly porcine kobuvirus) [6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 29].",

Generally, infectious viral diseases tend to be epidemic during the juvenile\nperiod [25, 26,\n32], and we observed a similar tendency for CaKoV in\nthe present study. Surprisingly, however, the frequency of viral RNA detection was confined in\nthe dogs four months old or younger and was never found in those older than five months. These\nfindings indicate that dogs have a strong age-dependent resistance to CaKoV and that the dog\ninfected with CaKoV in the past has a high resistance to reinfection. Unfortunately, since the\nkenneled dogs of this study were aged 1\u20133 months, the positivity could not be analyzed by age.\nFurthermore, our findings showed a high rate of detection of viral RNA in kennels, similar to\nthe finding of Choi et al. [4]. Thus,\nwe speculated that CaKoV prevalence is confined to multi-dog environments.",

Furthermore, 20.0% of the CaKoV-positive dogs were negative for\nother major diarrhea causative viruses, such as CDV, CAdV-1, CCoV and CRV. Recent\nepidemiological studies suggested possible involvement of porcine kobuvirus in diarrheal\ndisease seen in piglets [3, 19].
