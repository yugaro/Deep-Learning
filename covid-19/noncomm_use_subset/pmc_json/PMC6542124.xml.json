The heaviest burden is among high-risk groups that include pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions.3 In 2015, it was estimated to cause 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59 600 hospital deaths in children below 5 years of age worldwide.4,5",

This was achieved through the collaboration of Ministries of Health, partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU3), and the World Health Organization (WHO).7",
