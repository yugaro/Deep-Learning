            "text": "Although the study of individual patient swab specimens is considered the gold standard for clinical respiratory virus detection and characterization, several recent publications have demonstrated that aerosol sampling may also play an important role in understanding viral transmission in a number of field settings. Aerosol studies have clearly documented the presence of influenza A and other viruses in swine and poultry farms [5, 9, 16]. Additional studies have documented the value of aerosol sampling in various human settings. Some of these aerosol sampling data imply that close human-human contact may not be necessary for transmission. In a 2009 report, Blachere et al [17] found 53% of air samples collected in the US hospital\u2019s emergency department were positive for influenza virus. In a 2012 report, Wan et al [1] documented molecular evidence of adenovirus (18%) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (46%) in aerosol samples obtained in a Taiwanese pediatric hospital. In a 2013 report, Bischoff et al [6] found molecular evidence of influenza within 1.8 meters of hospitalized patients, suggesting that healthcare professionals might be exposed to infectious small-particle aerosols. In 2016 reports, Grayson [7], Lednicky [8], and Coleman [18] have similarly found molecular evidence of respiratory viruses in medical, apartment, or school settings with some samples containing viable virus [8]. Aerosol sampling has a number of advantages. In animal husbandry it can be used to explain transmission between barns or between farms [19, 20]. In the human setting, aerosol sampling involves minimal or no intrusions to patient flow and disruption of clinical care, no direct patient contact, and no requirement for informed consent. In contrast to individual patient studies, a single aerosol specimen collected over 30 minutes to 3 hours can represent a low-cost way to study multiple patients with a goal of informing healthcare officials when a novel respiratory virus has entered or become established in a healthcare setting. This approach could be particularly useful in settings where large numbers of people congregate or are in transit. Modern examples of novel respiratory virus introductions include novel zoonotic influenza A viruses and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus. Aerosol sampling has already been demonstrated in detecting novel H5 influenza A viruses in live animal markets in both China and the United States [10, 21].",

We found a higher prevalence of positive samples in the public health hospital, which arguably had the most patients, more acutely ill patients with symptoms, and longer patient wait times. We also observed a higher respiratory virus detection rate using the Personal Sampler. It is possible this increased rate was due to the longer run period or that specimens were combined, resulting in a higher concentration of target nucleic acid. Finally, our finding of a higher prevalence of adenovirus compared with the other 3 viruses tested for could be explained by the relative environmental stability of adenoviruses (double-stranded DNA viruses) compared with influenza viruses and coronaviruses (RNA viruses).",

However, the 3 sites did each report patients with respiratory illness signs and symptoms during the sampling periods, suggesting that the sick or accompanying asymptomatic shedders might be the source of aerosolized virus. The site with the most virus was in an emergency department where patients are more likely to manifest acute respiratory or enteric diseases. The study is also limited in that we did not have strong culture-positive evidence of viable virus in the positive specimens. Furthermore, although not the focus of our study, we are uncertain that if viable virus was present, and if it was in high enough titer, if it could cause human-to-human infection. However, in a number of animal husbandry and human medicine settings, the detection of molecular evidence of pathogens was strongly correlated with viable virus and animal-to-animal, human-to-human, or animal-to-human respiratory transmission [9, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23].",

Over the 2-month period, a total of 48 bioaerosol samples were collected from the 3 sites. Our finding of molecular evidence of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or adenovirus in up to 33.3% of collected samples and no such evidence in the control samples suggests that at least some of the patients were shedding virus in aerosolized respiratory droplets. As such, with aerosol sampling being noninvasive and relatively low in cost with respect to manpower and laboratory assays, one can see a role for such sampling in the surveillance for respiratory pathogens in clinical settings.",
