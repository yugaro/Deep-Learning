This straightforward treatment regimen for HIV/AIDS is currently the mainstay of treatment programmes in many developing countries. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) that combine two or more medicines into one pill have simplified AIDS treatment protocols, facilitated patient adherence and reduced the risk of drug resistance. Vigorous generic competition has reduced medicines prices to around US$ 87 for the first-line FDC of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine \u2013 roughly 1% of the price a decade ago. These factors combined have helped make possible a ten-fold increase in access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the developing world within the span of just six years.",

With increasing numbers of AIDS patients failing on their first-line therapy, there is also an urgent need to find affordable second-line treatments. In addition, about one-third of ARVs are not available in pediatric formulations, making effective treatment of children an even more difficult task. Finally, certain triple FDCs do not exist or sufficient suppliers are lacking for the improved first-line regimen and for second-line treatment.",

The governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom launched UNITAID at the UN General Assembly in September 2006. To date, 29 countries have committed to contribute, the majority of which are low- and middle-income.1 Countries levy a tax on flights leaving from their territories, and can adapt the tax according to their individual circumstances. For example, in France the tax is 1 EUR on short-haul economy-class tickets, and up to 40 EUR on long-haul business-class flights. A full flight from Paris to New York raises enough to cover a year\u2019s treatment for 60 HIV-positive children. Other countries are committing multi-year budgetary contributions, as has the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. UNITAID is an innovative financing mechanism that draws on both industrialized and developing countries to provide sustainable, long-term funding for health [2].",

In addition, UNITAID has funded WHO to add 61 medicines to its list of prequalified products. And it has supported treatment for pediatric and multi-drug resistant TB and helped to prevent TB drug stockouts by establishing a strategic international stockpile. Finally, UNITAID worked with WHO and UNICEF to speed shipments of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria to Liberia and Burundi in 2007 in order to avert a stockout. Recently, UNITAID has agreed to be a major funder for the first phase of the rolling out of the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria (AMFm), which will be hosted by the Global Fund.",

An FDC of three of these drugs currently does not exist or is in limited supply. The patents on every compound in this triple-therapy are held by a different company. A generic company seeking voluntary licenses for the development and production of these FDCs would have to obtain licences from four different patent-holders. However, if these patents could be combined in a patent pool the generic company would only have to deal with the pool, which would considerably decrease transaction costs and risk. Any qualified company that wanted to use the inventions could get a licence from the pool. The patent pool would be a one-stop-shop for all parties involved \u2013 it would facilitate the legal and bureaucratic processes involved in obtaining licenses, reduce transaction costs and increase access to the intellectual property needed to make important medicines.",

In addition to the examples listed above, patent pools have been proposed in the field of genetics, particularly for gene-based diagnostic testing [6]. The United States Patents and Trademark Office has explored the potential utility of patent pools for facilitating innovation in biotechnology, particularly for genome-related research. At a panel on the UNITAID patent pool at the 2008 Mexico City AIDS Conference, representatives of drug companies also expressed their openness to the idea [9]. Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced that it would make available its neglected disease-related patents through a pool and has called on other companies to follow suit [10]; others would be able to access those patents to develop medicines for the world\u2019s Least Developed Countries. Notably, GSK so far has not included HIV-related patents in the pool, which has prompted UNITAID to call on GSK to join the UNITAID initiative [11]. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) endorsed the UNITAID patent pool initiative in its meeting on 5 September 2008. Finally, patent pools were among the innovative approaches to research & development included in 2008 by the World Health Assembly in its Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property [12].",

Companies are urged to allow for sufficient scope in the licenses so that medicines production can be efficient and competitive.

Without access to affordable medicines, governments may choose to take advantage of available flexibilities in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to override patents to meet public health needs [13]. Certainly, doing so would provide countries with the benefit of lower-cost generic alternatives to monopoly-priced drugs. However, since compulsory licenses must be granted country-by-country, at a global level this approach is less likely to achieve economies of scale rapidly, would entail higher transaction costs, imply greater uncertainty for generic producers, and require significant political capital.

It will concentrate on urgently-needed products that have not yet been developed, such as FDCs and pediatric ARVs, and on existing products with high prices that may decrease with economies of scale, such as many second-line ARVs.  UNITAID has worked with the WHO HIV/AIDS Programme and the Department of Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies to draw up a list of missing essential ARVs [15]. The next steps will be to establish a licensing agency and to work with the relevant patent owners to agree on the specific licensing terms. Once up and running and proven effective, the patent pool could expand to respond to other diseases and health needs in developing countries.",

It requires new approaches to managing intellectual property in a manner that will support access to medicines for all. UNITAID extends an invitation to all concerned parties \u2013 patients, governments, donor agencies, civil society and generic and patent-owning pharmaceutical companies \u2013 to collaborate in establishing a patent pool that will broaden access to the knowledge that can save lives and improve health.",
