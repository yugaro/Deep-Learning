To\ndetermine whether the translocation of AIF was mediated by PARP-1 during TGEV-induced apoptosis, the PARP-1 inhibitor, ABT-888, was used to co-treat PK-15 cells with TGEV. Western blot assay\nwas used to measure the AIF protein levels in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 2A, ABT-888 markedly inhibited the total protein and cleaved protein levels of PARP-1, compared with TGEV infection alone, however the total protein levels of PARP-1 were no significant\ndifference in ABT-888- and TGEV- co-treated PK-15 cells, compared with ABT-888 treatment alone. Moreover, ABT-888 significantly inhibited the activation of PARP-1 and the AIF translocation\nwas prevented by ABT-888 (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that PARP-1 may be crucial in the AIF translocation during TGEV infection.",

To\nthat end, we used the p53 inhibitor, PFT-\u03b1, to co-treat the cells with TGEV and analyzed the AIF mRNA levels. Result showed that the mRNA levels of AIF decreased in the presence of PFT-\u03b1\ncompared to those without PFT-\u03b1 (Fig. 4A). To further explore the effect of p53 on AIF translocation, the AIF protein levels in the mitochondria and the nucleus were detected by Western blot.
