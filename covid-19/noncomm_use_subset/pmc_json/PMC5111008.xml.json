            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has been shown to cause severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Zaki et al. 2012). As of March 1, 2016, 1638 laboratory-confirmed cases (587 deaths; 36% case fatality rate [CFR]) have been reported to the World Health Organization. A South Korean outbreak of MERS began in May 2015, and its transmission continued until early July, resulting in 186 laboratory-confirmed cases with 38 deaths (20.4% CFR). In contrast to previous studies, which have suggested limited person-to-person transmissibility of MERS-CoV (Breban et al. 2013; Cotten et al. 2013b), many secondary and tertiary cases of transmission occurred during the South Korean outbreak. Importantly, more than half of the tertiary cases were transmitted from one particular super-spreader, called Patient 14 in this study. This unusual transmission pattern raised questions related to transmissibility as well as the potential adaptations of MERS-CoV to the human host. To address these questions, several researchers have investigated MERS-CoV sequences. However, all previous studies on the South Korean outbreak have focused only on the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs (Wang et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2016a,b; Park et al. 2016; Seong et al. 2016).",

            "text": "The evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses are complex because of their high mutation rates, rapid replication rates, and large population sizes. Multiple rounds of replication of a given viral genome can generate a cloud of diverse variants or a heterogeneous viral population. Previous reports on other RNA viruses have suggested that quasispecies diversity, rather than the selection of individual variants, correlates with pathogenicity and enables adaptation to new environments (Vignuzzi et al. 2006; Lauring and Andino 2010). The importance of characterizing viral populations as swarms with similar variants has led several groups to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on clinical samples to explore the complexity of the spectrum of mutant viruses, including HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus (Bushman et al. 2008; Eriksson et al. 2008; Margeridon-Thermet et al. 2009). Although the description of MERS-CoV quasispecies is far from completion, previous studies that recovered whole MERS-CoV genome sequences from dromedary camels revealed the existence of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (Briese et al. 2014; Borucki et al. 2016).",

For each patient, a MERS-CoV consensus sequence that indicated the major nucleotide at each genomic position was generated. The genome sequences of the eight isolates differed from each other at only seven positions (Table 2). The nucleotide substitutions were all nonsynonymous and occurred in the orf1ab (n = 3) and S (n = 4) genes (Table 2). The sequences of the eight isolates had high nucleotide identities (ranging from 99.96% to 100%, with 99.98% to 100% sequence identities in ORF 1a and 1b [orf1ab] and 99.85% to 100% identities in the spike glycoprotein gene) with recently published sequences of MERS-CoV isolates from the outbreak in South Korea (Kim et al. 2015; Lu et al. 2015; Seong et al. 2016). The E, M, and N genes were 100% identical to the previously described MERS-CoV isolates from South Korea. The sequence from Patient 14 in this study differed from the sequence from a previous study at two positions (Seong et al. 2016). Because the frequencies of the major nucleotides at these positions were close to 50% in this study, the differences between the consensus sequences may have arisen from small technical variations in measurement.",

Because deep sequencing not only generates a consensus sequence but also identifies non\u2013consensus nucleotides at each position, Cotton et al. (2013a) analyzed nucleotide variants present at >1% frequency to determine the variants important for intrahost evolution. In the previous study, the nucleotide variants present at a frequency greater than the sequencing error rate (i.e., 1%) were considered to be true variants, although this estimate may be conservative for most applications. However, errors introduced during reverse transcription and PCR amplification can significantly distort estimates of allele frequencies, especially if a limited amount of RNA is used as an input. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the reproducibility of allele frequencies of non\u2013consensus nucleotides. For this purpose, duplicate libraries generated by independent complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using the same RNA samples were sequenced and compared. Allele frequencies of duplicate samples from Patients 80 and 162 were significantly correlated, implying that the majority of mixed bases were a reflection of intrapatient heterogeneity rather than a result of sequencing errors (Fig. 1A,B).",

Eleven libraries from independent cDNA syntheses of five samples, including four libraries in duplicate and one in triplicate, were constructed to evaluate the technical noise in measuring allele frequency.

Technical noise is described in Methods and was based on a 5% significance level after performing Bonferroni adjustment.

Recently, both D510G and I529T mutations in RBD were shown to reduce its affinity for human CD26 compared with the wild-type RBD (Kim et al. 2016c). Although the previous study did not test the binding affinity of the double mutant, in our data the two mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting that the double mutant severely impairs viral fitness. Notably, although the frequency of each single mutant varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of both single mutants was consistently high in most samples. At the same time, the frequency of the wild type was no more than 10% in most samples (31 of 35 specimens). Thus, our data suggest that there was strong selection pressure favoring the variants of the spike glycoprotein with reduced affinity for the host receptor.",

Based on the spread of a mutant MERS-CoV with reduced affinity for the receptor, the authors suggested that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread might be driven by host immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies (Kim et al. 2016c).

            "text": "Thus, we questioned whether the selection pressure was exerted by a host immune response such as neutralizing antibodies, as previously suggested (Kim et al. 2016c). In such cases, a reduction in host immune pressure might increase the frequency of the wild type. Four specimens displaying relatively high frequency (i.e., >10%) of the wild type belonged to Patients 77 and 80. We noticed dramatic changes in routine blood test results such as white blood cell (WBC) counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in these patients. We analyzed 19 serial specimens from eight patients. For this, we used normalized WBC count values expressed as a percentage of the first of a series of samples from each patient. Serial samples from Patients 77 and 80 displayed a dramatic decrease in the normalized WBC count and a simultaneous increase in the frequency of the wild-type allele (Supplemental Fig. S4). Whereas WBC counts significantly decreased in those patients, the CRP level increased during the period of MERS-CoV infection, indicating an impaired immune response. Although these data are limited owing to the small sample size and the lack of direct measurement of host immunological pressure, our results suggest that the selection pressure exerted by the host immune response might favor variants with reduced affinity to the host receptor; therefore, a reduction in this selection pressure resulted in the expansion of viruses with the wild-type allele. The characterization and quantification of neutralizing antibodies in patients over time is required to determine their association with the mutants and to validate the hypothesis. Moreover, more accurate descriptions of MERS-CoV populations within patients will advance our understanding of the complex molecular evolution of MERS-CoVs.",

However, our knowledge of MERS-CoV evolution primarily depends on analysis at the interpatient level, ignoring genetic diversity within individual patients. In this study, we demonstrated intrapatient heterogeneity in human MERS-CoV isolates. Based on the analyses of the genetic diversity of MERS-CoVs at both the intra- and interpatient levels, our results shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of MERS-CoVs associated with the South Korean outbreak.",
