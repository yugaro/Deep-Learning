            "text": "Horses presenting with fever and nonspecific clinical signs of illness can present a diagnostic challenge for practitioners. Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a Betacoronavirus that is emerging as an agent isolated in association with outbreaks and sporadic cases of fever and enteric disease in adult horses worldwide. Recent reports have associated ECoV with outbreaks of enteric and pyrogenic disease causing substantial morbidity and higher than expected mortality in certain horse populations.1, 2, 3 Experimental inoculation of ECoV in Japanese Draft Horses led to fever and nonspecific signs of illness in 2 of 3 animals, suggesting that this virus may be a primary pathogen of adult horses although the molecular details of ECoV infection in adult horses remain unclear.4 Readily available molecular diagnostic tests and increased awareness of ECoV have facilitated recognition of ECoV as a potential pathogen.5, 6, 7 The preferred method for diagnosis of ECoV is quantitative PCR on fresh fecal samples, but outbreak reports indicate that horses clinically affected with ECoV are not always accurately identified by a single fecal PCR test.6, 7 Thus, it is important to develop a disease signature characterizing clinical features common to ECoV\u2010infected horses to improve clinical recognition of the pathogen.",

The most commonly reported clinical signs associated with ECoV infection during farm outbreaks are fever, anorexia, and lethargy, whereas experimentally inoculated horses develop gastrointestinal dysfunction in addition to fever and anorexia.3, 4, 6 We also found that fever and anorexia were the most common presenting complaints for all horses in our study, regardless of the diagnosis. The next most common clinical signs were colic and diarrhea, and the combination of fever with colic or diarrhea likely prompted clinicians to perform fecal diagnostic testing because these clinical signs are highly associated with a positive diagnosis of Salmonella in horses.14, 15, 16 Only 8 of the 42 horses were reported to have abnormal fecal character, indicating that abnormal feces are not always associated with enteric infections. We found that clinical signs were similar among groups, regardless of diagnosis, suggesting that the clinical signs attributed to ECoV and Salmonella infections are similar.",

Leukopenia was reported in 5 of 8 horses during an ECoV outbreak, with all 8 horses having lymphopenia and only 4 of 8 horses having neutropenia.3 Experimental inoculation of Japanese racehorses with ECoV caused a decrease in total white blood cell count, with only 1 of 3 developing leukopenia, but no differential cell counts were available.4 An additional report suggests that as many as 65% of horses with ECoV are neutropenic, but lack of case information precludes comparisons with our study.17 Our finding that ECoV horses had significantly lower neutrophil counts than horses with UNK is consistent with the available literature and suggests that neutropenia may be an important feature of ECoV infection.",

To increase the number of horses in the study population, we defined the UNK group as a horse that had 3 negative fecal Salmonella cultures and 1 negative fecal ECoV PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of fecal cultures increases with sequential sampling for Salmonella. Some studies suggest a minimum of 3 samples on enrichment cultures, whereas others suggest a minimum of 5 samples to improve sensitivity.11, 13 Diagnostic sensitivity is increased for a single sample when rectal mucosal biopsy specimens are cultured as compared with feces alone.12 In addition, a single positive fecal PCR for ECoV identified detectable virus in only 86% of horses with clinical signs during outbreaks.6 Thus, it is possible we could have misclassified up to 12%\u201014% of our horses as UNK because of decreased diagnostic sensitivity of only 3 fecal cultures for Salmonella and only a single fecal PCR for ECoV.11 The retrospective nature of the study further limited our analysis to admission data because data available during hospitalization was different among cases. Clinicopathologic data from presentation was selected for comparison because it was the most complete data set for horses meeting the inclusion criteria, although results of a differential cell count were only available for 5 of 8 ECoV horses. Temporal data analysis may have allowed us to identify clinical features unique to ECoV infection and should be pursued in future studies.",

For the remaining 5 horses with Salmonella and 7 of the ECoV\u2010positive horses, all testing was performed and no horse was positive for >1 pathogen.

As discussed, some of these horses may have been misclassified because of decreased diagnostic sensitivity associated with small numbers of fecal cultures and PCR test results. However, this number is comparable to previous reports in which approximately 60% of acute colitis cases had no definitive diagnosis.18 Although the focus of our investigation was to compare the clinicopathologic findings of horses testing positive for ECoV and Salmonella spp., the majority of horses included in the study (31 of 42 in total) and 21 of 22 UNK had a single fecal PCR test for a number of common enteric pathogens (Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Neorickettsia risticii). The 1 UNK horse without fecal PCR testing was tested for C. difficile toxins A and B by ELISA. All horses were negative for other pathogens. The total leukocyte counts of our UNK horses suggest 2 separate populations, with 1 group having higher than normal white blood cell counts. This observation may suggest that either there are some unidentified pathogens causing enteric disease in adult horses or that some horses are presented to the clinic after immunologic clearance of the offending pathogen and during the recovery phase. Further investigation is warranted into other potential infectious causes of febrile enteric disease in adult horses.",
