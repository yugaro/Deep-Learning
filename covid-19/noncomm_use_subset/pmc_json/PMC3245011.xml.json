Five such centers currently exist, each supporting a different class of human pathogens or insect vectors (www.pathogenportal.org). The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR; www.ViPRbrc.org) serves as the publicly accessible repository for viruses categorized as either A\u2013C priority pathogens or viruses that adversely affect public health (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/biodefenserelated/biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx). ViPR is unique among other virus-centered databases in that it contains a wealth of integrated information for a large number of virus families that are pathogenic specifically to humans. This is in contrast with the NCBI viral genome project, which provides sequence data for all viruses (7) or the Human Immunodeficiency Virus sequence database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov) and the Influenza Research Database (IRD, www.fludb.org) (8), which focus on a particular taxon or virus pathogen.",
