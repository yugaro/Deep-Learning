Samples were collected at the outpatient clinics, inpatient wards, and emergency department (ED) at the discretion of the on-service physicians. Samples were placed in M4-RT viral transport media (Remel, Lenexa, KS) and transported to the laboratory where they were frozen until testing.",

On the other hand, CoV-HKU1 infection among adults outside the United States have been reported with rates ranging between 0.04% and 2.1% [11\u201315]. Our rate of 1.6% is similar to these findings.

            "text": "It is interesting to note that adults identified with Cov-HKU1 had higher than expected severity of disease in our study, with increased occurrence of hospital admissions, oxygen use, and ICU admission. This is in contrast to other studies in which at-risk patient populations had lower morbidity and hospitalization with CoV-HKU1 infections [7, 8, 27]. Looking at other CoVs, the rates of hospitalization and morbidity were relatively similar in combined pediatric and adult studies [12]. Our finding of 54% hospitalization and 15% ICU admission could be accounted for by selection bias of the sample population (screening those presenting to the ED or hospitalized with respiratory tract illness). Studies focusing on outpatient and asymptomatic adults will provide a better understanding of disease severity. However, this study does demonstrate CoV-HKU1\u2019s potential for severe illness. A 75-year-old with no history of immunosuppression died due to shock while meeting clinical criteria for sepsis and negative infectious work-up. It remains unclear what, if any, role Cov-HKU1 played in this patient\u2019s demise. Most studies of Cov-HKU1 have demonstrated lower mortality [11]. In the 2 deaths reported by Woo et al [11], both patients were immunocompromised with history of cancer, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, and lymphopenia. Another death linked to CoV-HKU1 was reported in a severely immunocompromised patient lymphodepleted by conditioning for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [28]. In this case, CoV-HKU1 was isolated from his lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage with autopsy revealing bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage.",

This is similar to other studies in which up to 76% of patients with CoV-positive bronchoalveolar lavage received antibiotics [29]. Antibiotic use after a positive respiratory pathogen panel for viral pathogen was observed for median duration of 7 days in our study. This is consistent with other studies suggesting that mere disease diagnosis with respiratory pathogen panel might not alter antibiotic prescribing practices among healthcare providers for viral respiratory illnesses [30]. Such practices are concerning for unnecessary antibiotic exposure and the potential to aid the development of multidrug-resistant organisms [31]. This highlights the need for education of providers to consider CoV-HKU1 as a pathogen associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and de-escalate antibiotics with negative bacterial cultures and antigen [32].",

Higher coinfections with CoV and other viruses could suggest common reservoirs, overlap in seasonality, and persistence of virus or viral genome in respiratory secretions [33]. Among our 2 adults with CoV-HKU1 and influenza A coinfection, it was unclear whether symptoms were due to CoV-HKU1 or influenza or both. The clinical relevance of respiratory viral coinfections is not fully understood. Higher severity of respiratory disease has been reported in certain pathogen coinfection combinations, including influenza A with CoVs [34]. In other studies, there was no increased severity of illness in CoV-associated coinfections [15, 27, 35]. Gaunt et al [27] showed that a quantitative viral load for CoV was unchanged in cases of coinfection with RSV and monoinfection. Further investigation on the role viral coinfections play in alteration of respiratory disease severity should be undertaken.",
