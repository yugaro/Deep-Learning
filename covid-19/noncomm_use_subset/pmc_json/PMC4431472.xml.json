Simple and multivariate linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between the different variables (measured in weekly means) and the total number of weekly hospital admissions for COPD. Multicollinearity of the multivariate models was checked using Durbin-Watson tests. The real shape of the model was previously investigated by a general additive model. The determination coefficient was used to measure the quality of the models. P-values below 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

The most common virus is the human rhinovirus causing the common cold, which can be found in more than 50% of exacerbations, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and others.30,31 Viral infections lead to increased basal inflammation being present in the airways of patients with COPD.34",

Recent research suggests that human rhinovirus infections, at least in children, are more severe in winter.34 Another possible explanation for the increased number of hospitalizations for COPD in winter is the decline in lung function with the cold, and the increased airway inflammation and longer duration of exacerbation experienced by COPD patients with decreasing temperatures.35\u201338",
