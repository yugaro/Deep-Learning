Most cells for vaccine production are mainly based on established animal cells, such as MRC-5 human diploid cells, Vero simian kidney epithelial cells, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, and chicken embryo fibroblasts [2]. Especially, Vero cells, which are derived from the kidney of the African green monkey, have widely been used for vaccine production because they were shown to be free of oncogenic potential by the regulatory authorities such as the World Health Organization [13]. Many vaccines, such as those against chikungunya, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, viral gastroenteritis, polio, rabies, Ross River fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, West Nile encephalitis, and influenza have been developed using the Vero cell culture system [1].",

This has led to the development of immortal and stable cell lines with the capability of growth in suspension [4]. In recent studies, researchers have succeeded in growing Vero cells on micro-carriers for preparing suspension cultures of these cells [56]. Rourou et al. [6] reported that suspension cultivation of agitated Vero cell cultures promoted measles and rabies virus production from these cells. In addition, Shen et al. [7] showed that suspension-adapted Vero cells cultivated without microcarriers produced higher amounts of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) than adherent Vero cells. However, some hurdles associated with Vero cells, such as longer cell doubling time and low cell viability, still remain to be addressed via the formulation of appropriate adaptation processes.",

The usage of serum is not preferred due to its high cost and lot-to-lot variation [8]. In addition, viral, bacterial, and fungal contamination of bovine serum is one of the major concerns associated with the manufacture of cell culture-based vaccines. Therefore, optimization of cell culture system without serum is mandatory for the production of viral vaccine strains [4]. Several studies have attempted to develop a serum-free production platform for virus propagation [49]. In a previous study, MDCK cells cultured in serum-free EX-Cell MDCK produced higher amounts of influenza virus than those cultured in serum-containing Glasgow's Minimum Esssential Medium [10]. Furthermore, Vero cell culture in serum-free medium has been also explored to produce many viral vaccine strains [1112].",

Suspension culture Vero cells showed a significantly higher GFP intensity (over 1.5-fold higher) than their adhesive counterparts, indicating that Vero cells cultured in shaking suspension conditions can serve as a more suitable culture system to produce viral vaccine strains efficiently, compared to the conventional culture system for Vero cells (Fig. 3C).",

Since suspension culture system is a much less labor-intense procedure than the adhesive culture system, several studies have attempted to culture cells producing viral vaccine strains in suspension culture systems [10]. Several studies published data to support the propagation of rabies and Japanese Encephalitis viruses in suspension culture systems [613]. However, all previous studies described suspension cultures that require micro-carriers or other anchorages. Herein, we developed a Vero cell suspension culture system without using micro-carriers. Although during the early phase of culture, lower cell number and lower specific growth rate were observed, after 50 days, the total cell number and cell growth rate increased. In a previous study, Vero cells adapted to suspension growth showed a 1.5-fold efficacy for VSV propagation [14]. Another study demonstrated that suspension-adapted Vero cells produced 3-fold higher amounts of viruses than adherent Vero cells [7]. In this study, we showed that Vero cells cultured in shaking suspension culture system generated 1.5-fold higher amounts of adenovirus than the Vero cells cultured in adhesive plate.",
