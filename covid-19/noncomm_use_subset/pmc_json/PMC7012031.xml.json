The Riyadh region reported the highest number of cases (3818, 22.3%), followed by Jeddah (3378, 19.8%). The population density and crowdedness in these two regions may have predisposed to some A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks during winter seasons of 2015. There may be under-reporting from other regions, leading to an underestimation of the true disease burden. Aljouf and Hafr Albatin reported the least cases in seven years (38 and 35 cases, consecutively).",

The least affected were children and adolescents, but they still constitute a large proportion of cases (around 40%). All age groups were affected, and the proportions among age groups showed a similar pattern by time of year between clinical and confirmed cases. The occurrence of cases among all age groups indicates a community spread of infection following the 2009 pandemic. Over time, there was an observed gradual but constant decrease in younger age proportions and age shift towards elders.",

The CFR based on the suspected cases as the denominator [0.54% (CI: 0.50\u20130.58)] should be interpreted with caution. As well, CFR based on the confirmed cases as the denominator [3.56% (95%CI: 3.29\u20133.85)] represents the fatality among the severely morbid cases only. In line with international studies.21,22 the highest CFR was reported among the age group 60 years and above in all years, with 17.1% in 2011 and 15% in 2013, and this fits into the international data where influenza and pneumonia were the seventh cause of death in this age group. The next highest affected was the age group 30\u201359 years with 10.5% in 2013 and 9.5% in 2011. The overall fatality rates showed a decline over time with an age shifting towards elders.",
