ADEM following Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) infection is a rare condition. It should be in the differential diagnosis whenever respiratory symptoms are followed by neurological manifestations and encephalopathic signs [2].

The patient was transferred to another facility, where she was intubated for a worsening mental status.

She was also treated for possible encephalitis or meningitis with acyclovir, ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures did not grow any microorganisms and the patient did not show clinical improvement following antimicrobial therapy.

But, the therapeutic impact of antimicrobial agents like erythromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline or fluoroquinolone, is questionable. The use of antimicrobials that do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier remains uncertain with few cases having neurological recovery without antibacterial therapy and some patients having temporary clinical improvement with such therapy. However, antibacterials should be continued irrespective of prodromal or neurological manifestations until more evidence becomes available [7].",
