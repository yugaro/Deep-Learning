The NMI gene resides on chromosome 2q23. In humans, NMI protein expression has been detected in all fetal tissues except the brain, and its expression is highest in the adult spleen, liver and kidneys.1 The human NMI gene can code for two distinct mature mRNA transcripts that are translated identically into NMI protein products. The NMI protein is typically localized to the cytoplasm, but it has also been detected in the nucleus by multiple investigators.2, 3 As its name reveals, NMI was first identified as a binding protein partner of oncogenic transcription factors, N\u2010myc and c\u2010Myc.1 The synopsis of published literature about NMI indicates that this 38 kDa protein may function as an adapter molecule, capable of different functions depending on cellular context and proteins with which it interacts. The first one hundred amino acids of NMI comprise a coiled\u2010coil domain that is homologous to the C. elegans protein, CEF59. The second domain consisting of the next one hundred amino acids is referred to as the NMI/IFP35 (NID) domain, due to its homology with IFP35 (interferon inducible protein 35). All predicted domains of NMI are reported to be involved in protein\u2013protein interactions (Fig. 1\na). Several proteins confirmed to interact with NMI are transcription factors that influence (positively or negatively) tumor progression. The studies that substantiate these important protein\u2013protein interactions also support the proposition that NMI may have an important role in cancer (Fig. 1\nb).",

Surveys of breast tumor specimens from the Cancer Genome Atlas show little copy number variation or mutation of NMI, yet some independent studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NMI gene that are present in breast cancer and ovarian cancer patient samples.5, 6 Whether these SNPs cause mutations that alter NMI function was not investigated.",

Acetylation of ATM by Tip60 at lysine 3016 changes the conformation of ATM to allow substrate proteins to access the kinase domain of ATM.12 Ionizing radiation intensifies the interaction between NMI and Tip60 and leads to enhanced expression of both proteins.13 NMI was shown to associate with Tip60 in cytoplasmic speckles. Acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 is necessary to stabilize NMI levels, but the interaction of Tip60 and NMI is not dependent on acyltransferase activity, nor is NMI found to be acetylated by Tip60.13 These studies implicate NMI in this process by association, which again supports the proposition that NMI has a myriad of functions in cancer\u2010related mechanisms, each dependent on its protein\u2013protein interaction.",

Both Tip60 and ARF block MDM2\u2010mediated degradation of p53, and therefore control the p53/MDM2 checkpoint leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.16, 17 Decreased NMI expression, a phenomenon seen in late stage breast tumors, may potentially destabilize ARF as experimental observations showed that NMI inhibits proteasomal degradation of ARF by displacing ULF, the ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes ARF ubiquitination.14 Furthermore, NMI interacts with ARF after cells are stressed with DNA damaging agents such as IFN\u03b1, cisplatin or methylmethanosulfate. To summarize these findings, loss of NMI expression in cancer leads to down\u2010regulation of ARF, destabilization of p53 and subsequent desensitization of cells to DNA damage\u2010induced cell cycle arrest or cell death.

Early studies of NMI mostly examined its characteristics in hematologic cells. However, a consistent functional role for NMI in hematologic malignancies has not been identified thus far. Nagel et al. discovered that the interaction between STAT5, NMI and N\u2010myc mediates repression of myocyte enhancing factor 2c leading to increased apoptosis in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.28 Sun et al. identified NMI, from a human leukocyte library, as an interactor of the viral apoptosis\u2010inducing protein, Apoptin.29 Apoptin is encoded by the chicken anemia virus which infects hematopoietic cells in young chickens, and causes cell death that leads to anemia.30 Interestingly, Apoptin was found to selectively induce apoptosis in tumorigenic cell lines but not in non\u2010transformed, non\u2010tumorigenic cells.31 It was observed that Apoptin localized to the nucleus in malignant cells yet it remained cytoplasmic in non\u2010transformed cells. The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of Apoptin allows it to interact with the anaphase\u2010promoting complex/cyclosome, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.32 The region of Apoptin that interacts with NMI was later confirmed as a nuclear export sequence. Taken together, these data support a potential mechanism by which NMI\u2013Apoptin interaction selectively diminishes nuclear export of Apoptin and subsequently enhances the apoptic activity of Apoptin in transformed cells. This mechanism is speculative, especially since the nature of the NMI\u2013Apoptin interaction is not well understood; yet these data do provide suggestive evidence of NMI being involved in cancer\u2010cell\u2010specific apoptosis.",

Expression of NMI sensitized breast cancer cell lines to DNA damaging agents, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin.33 Autophagy, occasionally termed programmed cell death II, was implicated in the enhanced sensitivity imparted by NMI. NMI expression in NMI deficient cell lines elevated basal levels of autophagy in breast cancer cell lines, as indicated by autophagic vacuole formation. This was confirmed molecularly by LC3 processing and expression of Beclin, and p62.33 In certain cellular contexts, autophagy enables cell survival under conditions of stress. However, activation of autophagy beyond a threshold leads to extensive autodigestion and subsequent cell death.34 Numerous novel cancer treatment strategies aim to induce autophagic cell death.35 In the context of clinical specimens, NMI expression significantly correlated with the expression of DNA\u2010damage regulated autophagy mediator 1(DRAM1) mRNA in breast tumors collected by the Cancer Genome Atlas.33 DRAM1 is essential for the final steps of autophagy and mediates the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes.36 Experimentally, decreasing DRAM1 expression in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 breast cancer cells expressing NMI protected the cells against cisplatin treatment.33 Furthermore, Crighton et al. showed that DRAM1 induction of autophagy is essential for p53\u2010mediated cell death.37 In this study, combinatorial knock down of ATG5 and DRAM1 did not additively affect apoptosis, suggesting that both proteins act through the same cell death pathway\u2014autophagy.

In breast cancer, NMI expression is detected in early stage primary tumors. It is likely that loss of NMI precedes metastatic dissemination of breast tumor cells, as the expression of NMI is significantly lower in primary tumors of patients that have Stage 4 disease.4 Metastasis of epithelial cancers is a complex process that employs epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), entry into the vasculature (intravasation), survival within the circulation and colonization at a secondary site within a foreign microenvironment.42 EMT, the initial step of the metastatic cascade, is a developmental phenomenon whereby epithelial cells undergo a phenotypic change characterized by loss of epithelial markers, such as cytokeratins, followed by gain of mesenchymal markers. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by loss of apical\u2010basal polarity, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and invasion into surrounding tissue.43 EMT is controlled by a variety of signaling pathways that converge at the master regulatory transcription factors SLUG, SNAIL, TWIST and ZEB1/2.44 Silencing NMI in breast cancer cells with inherently epithelial phenotypes caused a morphological change, decreased expression of epithelial markers, as well as an increased expression of master regulators ZEB2 and SLUG.4 Devine and coworkers showed that NMI inhibits the EMT program by antagonizing TGF\u03b2 signaling. TGF\u03b2 stimulation leads to Smad\u2010dependent transcription of the master regulators of EMT, and therefore is a potent inducer of EMT.45 NMI expression reversed mesenchymal phenotypes of highly invasive breast cancer cells through enhancing STAT5\u2010mediated transcription of SMAD7.4 SMAD7, the inhibitory SMAD, provides negative feedback regulation on TGF\u03b2 signaling.46, 47\n",

Tri\u2010complex formation leads to the stabilization of cytosolic \u03b2\u2010catenin, a transcriptional co\u2010factor that can enter the nucleus, bind to a member of the TCF/LEF protein family and subsequently activate transcription of Wnt target genes.51 The presence of \u03b2\u2010catenin in cadherin\u2013catenin complexes that comprise epithelial cell tight\u2010junctions allows for maintenance of epithelial structure and inhibition of EMT.52 Accumulation of \u03b2\u2010catenin in the nucleus of breast carcinoma cells is associated with poor prognosis.53 In breast cancer, deregulation of the Wnt pathway is not due to mutation of the intracellular components, as in colorectal cancers. Instead, many breast cancers are dysregulated at other levels of the pathway, such as overexpression of the LRP6 co\u2010receptor and the FZD7 receptor, up\u2010regulation of secreted Wnt ligands and silencing of Wnt inhibitors SFRP\u20101 and WIF1.54\n",

The interaction between SOX10 and NMI may have a broader functional impact, as emerging evidence shows that SOX10 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells in the breast, salivary and bronchial glands.63 In addition, SOX10 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in most molecular subtypes of breast cancer patient samples.64\n",

            "text": "The most effective, intrinsic, protective force against disseminated tumor cells is the immune system. Immune cells rely heavily on JAK/STAT signaling to direct cellular responses upon cytokine stimulation. Compared to other adult tissues, hematopoietic cells have significantly higher endogenous levels of NMI mRNA indicating that NMI may play an integral role in the function of these cells.1 The first study that identified NMI's ability to enhance or alter activity of transcription factors described NMI's effect on signal transducer and activator (STAT) proteins. NMI interacts with all STATs except STAT2 in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes.65 The interaction between STAT1 or STAT5 and NMI significantly increased the activity of their respective target gene luciferase reporters.65 STAT1 activity promotes an inflammatory anti\u2010tumor immune response in innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells or macrophages.66 Furthermore, STAT1 signaling stimulates the T helper 1 phenotype in CD4+ T cells of the adaptive immune system, creating an inflammatory response through the production of IFN\u03b3.66 STAT5, on the other hand, impacts differentiation of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Th1 versus Th2 differentiation and development of regulatory T cells.67 It is feasible that modulation of STAT1 or STAT5 activity by NMI impacts the maturation of innate and adaptive immune cells. Interestingly, the activity of STAT1 and STAT5 reporters was enhanced further when the histone acetyltransferases, CBP and p300, were independently co\u2010transfected; and it was proposed that NMI enhances the interaction between STATs and CBP/p300.65 This study suggests that NMI facilitates binding between epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors to enhance transcription of downstream target genes. The specific contribution of NMI to the anti\u2010tumor immune response is an area that has not been studied.",

In addition, the pivotal role of the host immune system in eliminating cancer cells has been garnered for treatment. Based on its ability to influence JAK/STAT signaling, it is feasible that NMI plays a role in the host's viral response. Indeed, NMI has been independently identified by groups studying viral infection as a mediator of host\u2013viral response.70 NMI was proposed to facilitate apoptosis through interaction with FMDV 2C, a key protein from a virus that causes foot and mouth disease in swine.71 The FMDV 2C\u2013NMI complexes were speculated to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum. In an independent study, microarray data from cells overexpressing HIV viral proteins showed a twofold decrease of NMI mRNA, suggesting it may have a mechanism in host cell viral defense during HIV infection.72 Most recently however, NMI was identified as a binding partner of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus non\u2010structural protein 6.70, 73 Protein 6 is a transmembrane protein that localizes to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and is assembled into a replication complex that facilitates viral replication. Interestingly, it inhibits the host's innate immune response by binding and preventing nuclear import of STAT1.74 The NMI protein 6 interaction led to the destabilization of NMI.70 Although these studies were conducted independently it is intriguing to speculate that degradation or sequestration of NMI by SARS coronavirus protein 6 could contribute to the inhibitory effect on STAT1.",

Therefore, it is essential to know what pathways directly regulate the transcription, translation, and stability of NMI. Early studies of NMI induction indicate that its subcellular localization may be coupled to its regulation and function. Seminal studies identified that NMI expression is transcriptionally induced downstream of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IFN\u03b1 and IL\u20102.65 Downstream mediators such as STAT1 and STAT5 are most likely responsible for binding the NMI promoter. NMI, in turn, facilitates the activity of STATs, as previously described, allowing for a robust positive feedback response after cytokine stimulation. Interferon treatment resulted in the formation of high molecular mass complexes (HMMCs) of 300\u2013400 kDa. These complexes were visualized as NMI/IFP35 speckles (NIS) in previous publications and they formed following dephosphorylation of IFP35.75, 76 The function of the NIS complex warrants further exploration, as it may play a role in the human viral response. Other interactors of NMI such as c\u2010Myc, N\u2010myc and c\u2010fos are not thought to be contained in the HMMC. Molecular analysis confirmed that the fractionation properties of NMI change after treatment with IFN\u03b3, indicating a shift in subcellular location.77 Multiple groups have shown that induction of NMI leads to its translocation into the nucleus.77, 78 This may allow NMI to interact with nuclear transcription factors. It has also been reported that cytokine\u2010induced NMI expression leads to reorganization of the NMI protein into puncta within the cytoplasm.76 Thus, NMI seems to have a distinct cytoplasmic role(s).",

NMI has clearly emerged as a protein that binds to both transcription factors as well as epigenetic modifiers and modulates their activities. Thus far, the only chromatin modifiers shown to bind NMI are histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Luciferase reporter studies indicate that these interactions influence promoter activity of downstream target genes. The functional consequences of the molecular interaction between NMI, transcription factors and HATs remain unclear. Clinical studies suggest that NMI plays a tumor suppressive role in epithelial cancers such as breast cancer while it indicates a poor prognosis in mesenchymal\u2010like tumors such as gliomas. It is likely that the stage in which NMI is most critical depends on the specific histological tumor type and how far it has progressed.
