Eventually, he scientifically answered a number of questions and suggested that these gene-less proteins can replicate in the body, induce the disease, and be subsequently transmitted to other animals; he received a Nobel Prize for his work in 1997. This type of prion-only hypothesis is recognized as a new pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative disorders [12].",

PrPSc, a scrapie form of a prion known to be pathogenic and misfolded, does not always induce clinical symptoms; therefore, the PrPSc that induces clinical symptoms is marked as a disease prion: PrPd. However, prions already exist in animals and humans in the cellular form of the protein (PrPC), which does not have any pathogenic properties. The primary amino acid sequences and the state of modification in both isoforms of PrPSc and PrPC are identical; however, they have different three-dimensional structures, which give them distinct biochemical and biophysical properties. Also, alterations in amino acid sequences change the conformation of these proteins, resulting in a thermodynamically stable protein variant (PrPSc) that can cause diseases in both animals and humans [14].",

            "text": "When PrPC comes in contact with PrPSc, PrPC changes into a thermodynamically stable PrPSc via protein folding; then, PrPSc converts PrPC into another PrPSc. After this process is repeated over time, PrPSc accumulates in the body and results in induction of TSE [15]. Although it is not certain whether TSEs are caused by PrPSc alone or by a complex reaction with PrPSc and other factors, such as other proteins, nucleic acids, or pathogens [16], it is certain that the main causative agent is PrPSc. However, to explain the replication of PrPSc within the body, two thermodynamically stable PrPSc molecules must be separated and combined with other PrPCs. The animal\u2019s genetic type and other additional factors should be considered in the process [17]. Therefore, scientists assume that the hypothetical macromolecule\u2014designated protein X\u2014may play a role in the conversion from PrPC to PrPSc and continue to search for candidates. At present, dozens of proteins in the cytosol, plasma membrane, extracellular matrix, and lipid rafts are known to interact with PrPC and/or PrPSc; however, strong evidence for the identity of protein X has not been revealed yet [18]. Identifying the existence and role of protein X, prion diseases can be prevented and/or treated. Normal PrPC, which is encoded on the gene locus PRNP in the genome of hosts, is a glyco-protein found in neuron cell membranes in animals and humans. PrPC has a \u223c40% \u03b1-helical and \u223c3% \u03b2-sheet conformation, whereas PrPSc has a \u223c30% \u03b1-helical and \u223c40% \u03b2-sheet conformation. The conformational transition from the helices and hydrophobic regions of PrPC is a major cause of the increase of \u03b2-sheet composition in PrPSc (Figure 1) [19,20]. Since the conformational alteration from PrPC to PrPSc is not immunogenic, the immune system of the organism can hardly distinguish the normal protein structure from the infectious prion structure, except with respect to its stability [21]. Unlike bacteria or viruses, pathogenic PrPSc cannot be removed by regular alcohol or formalin sterilization processes, and cannot be decomposed by proteolytic enzymes. Moreover, it is resistant to heat, ultraviolet rays, and chemicals. Under three times the atmospheric pressure the materials for prion should be sterilized for more than 18 minutes at 134\u2013138\u00b0 C; surfaces should be sterilized for over an hour with 2% sodium hypochlorite and 2N sodium hydroxide at 20\u00b0C, and equipment should be sterilized for more than 12 hours with the same solution. In laboratories, materials should be disinfected for more than 4.5 hours at 132\u00b0C or for 1 hour at 134\u2013138\u00b0Cby steam sterilization under pressure. Because it responds well to alkaline conditions, highly concentrated sodium hydroxide or phenol is used to decontaminate PrPSc[22].",

The disease is transmittable via surgical tools that came into contact with SRM and via blood transfusion. Since blood rarely contains the prion, it was considered safe until a death caused by vCJD from a blood transfusion was reported in the UK, which was alarming to the public. From this case, the UK spent more than \u00a3200 million on a preventive process to protect surgical tools against prion transmission. This shows that the occurrence of BSE or vCJD can cause an enormous amount of indirect expenses, although they do not occur frequently.",

The value of the species barrier for prion disease transmission between humans and cattle has been estimated to be 4000, based on the study of BSE zoonosis. However, a precautionary principle assumes that there is only one value of species barrier between humans and cattle, and suggests that the same dose that causes the disease in cattle may affect humans in the same way [23]. The experimental disease-inducing amount of SRM in a single administration is 0.001 g injected orally; 10 g can lead to BSE in all administered cattle [24]. The amount required to induce the disease is very small; a scientific report submitted to the British Council in 2001 states that an amount as small as one speck of pepper may cause the disease [25]. Five grams of an oral inoculum with brain homogenate from a BSE-infected cattle in a primate (Cynomolgus macaques) resulted in the development of a vCJD-like neurological disease 60 months after exposure [26].",

It is notable that in the study of pathogenic prions, the protein particles have been observed to have many different strains, which are under investigation [27].

It is noteworthy that prion diseases among sheep and deer can be transmitted horizontally by saliva, unlike BSE or vCJD [36]; CWD can even be transmitted via aerosols, according to a recent animal experiment report [37].",

A study on kuru among cannibal tribes shows that the incubation period of prion diseases differs among individuals based on genotype [53]. The MM type at codon 129 of the prion is most common in Korean people and has the shortest incubation period, with death following shortly after disease development; the methionine\u2013valine heterozygote (MV type) appears to be most resistant to the disease, and a case with 40 years of incubation has also been reported. At present, all vCJD patients in Europe (including patients affected through transfusion [54]) have the MM type except for one case [55]. Therefore, Aguzzi at University Hospital of Zurich in Switzerland warns that patients should be observed for at least 40 years since the number of patients with the MV type may increase in the future. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee appointed by ministers from the UK assumes that there may be 4000\u201310000 infected persons with no symptoms in the UK; however, valine homozygote- (VV type) or MV-type patients may die of different causes due to the long incubation period after they have been exposed to the pathogenic prion.",

While sCJD is common in older people, vCJD can occur in young people after a short incubation period [58]. There is much epidemiological and laboratory evidence of a strong correlation between variants of CJD and BSE; vCJD differs from other CJDs clinically and histopathologically, and the initial extended exposure of the population to potentially BSE-contaminated food (1984\u20131986) was geographically and chronologically consistent with the initial onset of vCJD cases (1994\u20131996), considering the incubation period [1,59]. The facts that sCJD occurs in old people at the ratio of one to two out of 1 million people and vCJD is frequent in people in their 20s and 30s have led the public to believe that the dietary habits of the younger generation (who tend to eat more fast food such as hamburgers) may be the cause of the disease. However, recent findings suggest that age-related body conditions are the causative factors of the disease [60]. The EU has been establishing countermeasures against the transmission of vCJD via blood transfusion. Current studies are focusing on the possibility of transmission via dental treatment [61,62].",

Second, surveillance systems are also important, although most countries consider testing regimens merely as tools for epidemiological monitoring of the disease. In that respect, active surveillance systems should be retained for some more time, although the current regulatory design can be modified to be more flexible when all stakeholders are in a consensus.",

The EU maintains estimations of cow age through a history tracking system called traceability, in which the electronic ear tag of the cow must match its history document before it can be slaughtered. Because of such strict management, BSE outbreak is decreasing in the EU. However, there are still some nonscientific opinions based on the distorted understanding; some people believe that it does not matter to assume a cow\u2019s age by examining its teeth while importing SRM and that this disease itself is going to disappear soon.",

SRM standards set by the OIE are \u201cconditions or guidelines for trade\u201d that can prevent the disease from spreading from one country to another. Based on these criteria, countries are supposed to establish their own trade regulations in which their industry structures, conditions for controlling the disease, and dietary habits should be considered. In other words, OIE regulations are the necessary conditions for all countries to follow to prevent the spread of the disease. However, SRM standards set by the EU are \u201cscientifically sufficient conditions\u201d that participating countries with different cultural and industrial backgrounds can utilize [75].",

In fact, the possibility of BSE and vCJD occurring naturally in Korea is extremely low. The major reason for this is that there are not enough preconditions for such diseases to occur. Korea has historically had few sheep farms. A British national institution reports that one of the main causes of the BSE outbreak in the UK was feeding cows with sheep intestines [25]. However, Korea has not developed sheep farming, so the precondition of the BSE and vCJD pandemic does not exist there. The second reason is that Koreans used to consume cow intestines. For the epidemic to spread, there should be at least some infected entities; after the tipping point (threshold), it becomes an epidemic [76,77]. Prion diseases have species barriers; within one species, the diseases spread more easily and quickly. However, a step for the multiplication of prions within a species is blocked since Koreans consume cow intestines themselves rather than feeding them to cows. In that respect, it is almost impossible for BSE or vCJD to occur naturally in Korea. If a BSE outbreak is reported in Korea, the cause would likely be from outside the country.",
