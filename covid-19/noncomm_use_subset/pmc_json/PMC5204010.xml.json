Specific serotypes of the ADV (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 21, and 55), a younger age (less than one year), and immunocompromised hosts have been reported as risk factors for severe ADV infection [567891011].",

More cases of multiple respiratory viral infections have been diagnosed using these multiplex PCR tests than were reported before using conventional testing methods [121314]. Consequently, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections, especially coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has been evaluated since the 2000s [15]. In a recently published meta-analysis, respiratory viral coinfections were not reported to result in a significant increase in the clinical severity of respiratory infections compared with single viral infections [15]. However, their clinical effects vary depending on the coinfected viruses and the subjects enrolled in each study. Therefore, while respiratory viral coinfections reportedly manifest as more severe illnesses in some studies [1617], other investigators report a lack of association between viral coinfection and disease severity in ADV infected children [18]. Furthermore, even as ADV infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfection on childhood ADV infection has rarely been reported [19]. In addition, previous studies on ADV coinfections included only children younger than 1 or 3 years of age, or children with lower respiratory tract infections [182021]. This retrospective study was performed to investigate the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections in Korean children with ADV infection.",

The variability in the reported coinfection frequency could be due to the methods of viral detection, the number of detectable viruses, the characteristics of enrolled patients, the frequencies of underlying disorders, the seasons when the studies were performed, and the inclusion or exclusion of URTI [1428]. Most studies reported a higher frequency of respiratory viral coinfection in younger children than in older children and adults [12142728]. This presumably was caused by immature immune systems, the lack of protective immunity arising from prior exposures to viruses, and prolonged excretion of respiratory viruses in younger children compared with older children and adults [142128]. Although respiratory viral coinfection increased the rate and duration of hospitalization [141727], it eventually did not cause a poorer prognosis such as oxygen supplementation and ICU admission, compared with single viral infection [1727]. In a recent meta-analysis, the overall effect of respiratory viral coinfections on the disease severity and prognosis was not significant [15].",

In addition, the increased LRTI cases we report in the coinfection group have been reported previously [1924]. In the present study, we observed a significant association between the presence of underlying medical conditions and coinfection, although this has not been a significant coinfection associated factor in some other previous studies [1822]. Eleven of 13 children with underlying medical conditions in the present study had a preterm birth history, and eight of them had a previous history of BPD. These medical conditions may affect the lower respiratory tract function during infancy and early childhood. Amongst younger age, LRTI, and underlying medical conditions, factors related to coinfection based on a univariate analysis, only the younger age was associated independently with coinfection following a logistic regression test.",

Some other investigators have, on the other hand, reported no significant effect of coinfection on the duration of hospitalization and disease severity [1822]. In the present study, coinfection caused more LRTIs compared with ADV single infection, and therefore, manifested as more clinically severe and progressive disease than ADV single infection. In addition, oxygen therapy was administered more frequently in the coinfection group, especially in children coinfected with ADV and RSV, than in the ADV group. However, the oxygen supplementation duration in the coinfection group was less than 3 days, and there was no ICU admission and mortality in this group. Furthermore, the duration of hospitalization and fever was not significantly different between the coinfection and ADV groups. This suggested that even as respiratory viral coinfection may contribute to increased disease severity in children with ADV infection, appropriate treatment for such a condition can prevent further disease progression and poor prognosis.",

We did not identify infecting ADV serotypes in our study, and the severity of ADV infection, as well as frequency of respiratory viral infection, varied according to the causative serotype [891011]. To evaluate the impact of specific ADV serotypes on clinical severity and frequency of coinfections, a multicenter study, involving several geographically-separated hospitals would need to be conducted for a sufficiently long period to capture multiple ADV outbreaks with different causative serotypes. Attending daycare centers may further increase the risk of exposure to a variety of respiratory viruses, and influence the frequency and severity of respiratory viral infections; however, this was not evaluated in the present study. We also could not determine the independent effect of each respiratory virus concurrently identified with ADV infection because of the small group size for each respiratory virus. Finally, the impact of coinfection on the long-term sequelae of ADV infection (e.g., bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans) could not be assessed [2930].",
