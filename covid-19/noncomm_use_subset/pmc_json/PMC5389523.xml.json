RNA structure can be studied using low-throughput techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. More recent approaches have started to exploit biochemical reactions to perform high-throughput profiling of the RNA structure: Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS) distinguishes double- and single-stranded regions using the catalytic activity of two enzymes, RNase V1 (able to cut double-stranded nucleotides) and S1 (able to cut single-stranded nucleotides) (3,4), while Selective 2\u0384-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) (5,6) employs highly reactive chemical probes such as 1M6, NMIA (SHAPE) and NAI-N3 (icSHAPE) to characterize RNA backbone flexibility. Another technique based on dimethyl sulfate (DMS) (7) is often used for in vivo probing of transcriptomes (8,9). DMS experiments are of high quality due to the smaller size of the (CH3O)2SO2 probe, yet have low coverage, since the alkylating agent only reacts to adenine and cytosine.",

This observation indicates that the neural network approach is particularly suitable to identifying complex patterns in biological sequences, which is key to discover trends in large data sets (20). We also note that CROSS models are sensitive to single point mutations: the signal drops progressively upon insertion of random mutations in the original sequences (PARS-Yeast; Supplementary Data).

To illustrate CROSS performances on large RNAs, we predicted the structural profile of murine Xist non-coding RNA (17 900 nt) using the consensus of our five models (Materials and Methods: Consensus models; Figure 7A). Xist was analyzed using DMS probing (16), an independent technique not used in the training of CROSS (the transcript was not present in any training set of CROSS). Using the top and bottom 10% of the experimental DMS data on Xist profile (3 580 fragments removing regions with unreliable scores in Rep B) the Z-Score shows an AUC of 0.75 (Figure 7A, right corner). In agreement with DMS experiments (16), CROSS identifies the structural elements associated with repetitive regions Rep A, B and F and resolves their internal structures with correlations of 0.35, 0.46 and 0.75, respectively (see Supplementary Data). Although the method slightly overestimates the structural content of Rep E, it is able to accurately predict its profile (correlation of 0.63, Supplementary Data). While the sequences of Rep A and B are conserved across species and show a high degree of structural content, the 3\u0384 region of Xist is variable (24) and predicted by CROSS to be more single-stranded.",

In agreement with previous evidence (1), we predict that UTRs are more structured than CDSs (P-value < 2.2e-16; Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov). Long intergenic non-coding transcripts (see Supplementary Data: Long intergenic non-coding RNAs) are found to be less structured, as reported in other studies (25) (P-value < 2.2e-16; Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov). Indeed, long non-coding RNAs have complex regulatory abilities and their structure could be more flexible and less structured to provide a wide range of interactions (26). In agreement with previous data (27), we also observe that the 5\u0384 UTR of the amyloid precursor protein APP transcript is highly structured (>65% double-stranded). Similarly, the mRNA of serpin peptidase inhibitor SERPINE3 is predicted to be highly structured (>55%), as reported in PARS screenings (4). We predict that 45% of Xist is structured in domains, as revealed by DMS profiling (16).",

Each model was trained on one data set (PARS-Human, PARS-Yeast, icSHAPE-Mouse, SHAPE-HIV and NMR/X-ray) and tested on the others. (B) Performances increase from low- (median) to high-confidence (top and bottom 5%) values of the CROSS scores distribution (Supplementary Data). The plot illustrates the performances of the icSHAPE-Mouse model tested on the SHAPE-HIV data set. (C) High-confidence predictions: the arrows connect the training and testing sets along withrelative accuracies (cross-validation on training sets are marked with circular arrows). We used the same number of nucleotides with high (double-stranded) and low (single-stranded) propensity scores for comparison with experimental data. Negligible overlap exists between training and testing sets (Jaccard index < 0.002 between each couple of sets analyzed; Supplementary Data).",

Structured regions, in correspondence to known repetitive domains (Rep A, B and F), are highlighted and the correlations with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) data (16) are reported on top. A detailed view of the CROSS and DMS profiles for Rep A, B, F and E is provided in Supplementary Data. We note that Rep B contains regions with insufficient sequencing data to determine DMS reactivity (16) that were excluded from the analysis. Our predictions indicate lower structural content at 3\u0384, in line with previous reports indicating poor sequence conservation (only Rep A and B are highly conserved) (24). The ROC curve of the Z-Score predictions on high-confidence DMS data (10% top and bottom nucleotides, 3 580 fragments) is reported in the corner (AUC 0.75). (B) Predictions of human coding DNA sequences (CDSs), untranslated regions (UTRs) and long-intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) (ENSEMBL version 82; total number of transcripts: 50 000; 14 000 lincRNA isoforms). We predict that the UTRs are more structured than the CDSs, in agreement with previous studies (P-value < 2.2e-16, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov) (1). For each set we show a known example [the APP 5\u0384 UTR is more structured, as shown in previous studies (27); SERPINE3 has a structured CDS in agreement with PARS data (4); Xist structural content is in agreement with DMSdata (16)].",
