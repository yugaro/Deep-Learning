These parameters include demographic factors, such as gender, mean age, nationality of the patients, and salient characteristics, and features related to the disease, i.e., travel history, background of contact with camel or camel milk 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms and contact with morbid case at home or hospital 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, admission to a hospital, need for admission to a negative pressure isolation room or ICU, and the final outcome during or after occurrence (dead/survived). In Table 1 we also see that in all years, the proportion of males was higher than in females, more of them had the Saudi nationality, and more number of MERS-CoV cases occurred approximately at age near and up to 50 years. One of the reason for this is the people near and up to 50 years of age are at a greater risk of complications resulting from MERS-CoV or viral infections than other people in low and middle ages. On the other hand, men in comparison to women are likely to spend more time outdoors and therefore have a higher risk of exposure to a source of infection.",

As we follow the dynamics of the disease from 2013 to 2016 (Table 3), these factors remain important. However, some interesting factors such as nativity and travel history that are significant in predicting mortality varied in different years. With attention to this fact, the majority of MERS-CoV cases that occurred outside of the middle east had travel history to countries in or near the Arabian peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset. Therefore, this can be an evidence for the human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV infection. For nativity, there is a need for further studies on genetic features of the culprit virus.",

Further prospective studies are necessary to explain the effects of all potential risk factors investigated in this study for the outcome (dead/survived) in individuals with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Second, possible misclassification in the categorization of cases may be due to the respondents, declaration such as background of contact with morbid case at home or hospital 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms household, comorbidity, and background of contact with camel or camel milk 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, which potentially may occur as a result of the measurement bias. Third, it should be mentioned that from 186 MERS-CoV cases occurred in Republic of South Korea, only details related to 57 cases were published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website. This might introduce a negligible selection bias in the results.",
