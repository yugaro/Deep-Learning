Since then, as per September 2018, 2,249 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and at least 798 associated deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO), 2018). Although the majority of cases were reported in the Middle East region, travel\u2010associated cases have been documented in other parts of the world (Cotten, Watson, et al., 2013; Hsieh, 2015; Tsiodras et al., 2014; WHO, 2015). On September 8th, 2018, South Korea reported the first MERS\u2010CoV case since the end of an outbreak in 2015, suggesting that MERS\u2010CoV is still a worldwide threat (WHO, 2018).",

Moreover, animal\u2010to\u2010human transmissions have been described (Azhar et al., 2014). More recently, a surveillance study showed that a MERS\u2010CoV strain responsible for human outbreaks was isolated from the upper respiratory tract of dromedaries, demonstrating that the virus does not require mutations to jump between species (Sabir et al., 2016). Besides dromedaries, several animal species, including common marmosets, rhesus macaques, llamas, pigs and alpacas, are experimentally susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV infection (Adney, Bielefeldt\u2010Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016; Falzarano et al., 2014; Vergara\u2010Alert et al., 2017; de Wit et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a positive\u2010stranded RNA virus that belongs to the betacoronavirus genus (Zaki et al., 2012). It has a genome of approximately 30 Kb nucleotides that encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, and a RNA polymerase (Cotten, Lam, et al., 2013; Cotten et al., 2014; Zhang, Shen, & Gu, 2016). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S\u2010protein mediates viral entrance through binding dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4, also known as CD26), a serine protease expressed on the surface of many cell types (Raj et al., 2013). The tissue distribution of DPP4 has been described in some animal species, including dromedary camels, bats, pigs, llamas, sheep and horses (Vergara\u2010Alert et al., 2017; Widagdo et al., 2016, 2017). However, although DPP4 is decisive for MERS\u2010CoV entry in vitro (Raj et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2016), the role of the protein in determining tissue tropism with regards to MERS\u2010CoV pathogenesis in vivo has not been fully elucidated. MERS\u2010CoV antigen has been demonstrated in nasal epithelial cells expressing DPP4 (Haagmans et al., 2016; Vergara\u2010Alert et al., 2017). However, no double staining studies to detect potential co\u2010localization of both antigens were reported until very recently. Haverkamp et al. (2018) demonstrated that nasal epithelial cells infected with MERS\u2010CoV in dromedaries seemed to lose DPP4 expression, while adjacent non\u2010infected cells retained positivity for DPP4. Moreover, ciliary damage was also a feature of dromedary camels infected with MERS\u2010CoV (Haverkamp et al., 2018). These authors postulated that the mild and transient disease in dromedaries is, at least in part, potentially attributable to the down\u2010regulation of its own cell entry receptor, thus self\u2010limiting the viral infection.",

Moreover, if the ciliary loss is a particular finding of dromedary camels infected with MERS\u2010CoV or may also affect other susceptible species is not known. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the co\u2010localization of MERS\u2010CoV and DPP4 by means of double immunostaining in two susceptible species: llama and pig. In addition, the degree of ciliation of the upper respiratory tract in both species was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

Four pigs were euthanized on day 2 post\u2010inoculation (p.i.) with an intravenous overdose of pentobarbital followed by exsanguination, and four animals of each species were killed on day 4 p.i. The remaining animals (six pigs and four llamas) were euthanized on day 24 p.i. following the same protocol. Complete necropsies were performed and respiratory and lymphoid tissues (nasal turbinate, trachea, bronchus, lung, cervical lymph node, mediastinal lymph node, tonsil and thymus) were collected for IHC and RT\u2010qPCR examination.

On the following day, slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 (pH 7.45), and incubated for 1 hr at RT with alkaline phosphatase\u2010labelled horse anti\u2010goat IgG (ImmPRESS\u2122\u2010AP Polymer Anti\u2010Goat IgG Reagent, Burlingame, CA, USA). Each slide was then incubated with ImmPACT Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate (Burlingame, CA, USA) for 10 min and presence of antigen produced a bright red reaction product. Subsequently, the same slides were subjected to MERS\u2010CoV IHC using a monoclonal primary antibody (final concentration of 0.8 \u03bcg/ml) that specifically reacts with the viral N protein (SinoBiological Inc., Beijing, China), according to a previously published method (Haagmans et al., 2016). After 4\u00b0C overnight incubation with the primary antibody, samples were then incubated with peroxidase labelled polymer goat anti\u2010mouse IgG (DAKO; Agilent Technologies Company, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 1 hr at RT. The 3,3\u2032\u2010Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution (0.1 g DAB in 200 ml PBS with 100 \u03bcl H2O2) was applied for 10 min to obtain positive signals with brown colour in the tissues. Finally, slides were counterstained with haematoxylin for 10 s and then coverslipped with mounting medium prior to microscopic examination (Nikon Eclipse 50i). Negative controls included the addition of blocking solution (DAKO; Agilent Technologies Company, Santa Clara, CA, USA) instead of primary antibodies for both immunohistochemical techniques. The studied tissues of pigs and llamas were considered as positive controls for the DPP4 IHC, since they constitutively express the studied viral receptor. Also, a nasal turbinate from a dromedary camel infected with MERS\u2010CoV (Haagmans et al., 2016) was used as positive control for MERS\u2010CoV IHC. A grading system for virus antigen expression was established based on the number of cells stained by IHC. Four scores were defined: \u2212, no positive cells detected; +, less than 10 positive cells per tissue section; ++, 10 to 50 positive cells per tissue section; and +++, more than 50 positive cells per tissue section.",

In addition, the amount of MERS\u2010CoV antigen in these two species showed a consistent correlation with the MERS\u2010CoV genome levels detected by RT\u2010qPCR in respiratory and lymphoid tissues, indicating that host cell factors necessary for MERS\u2010CoV attachment, penetration and RNA and protein synthesis are present in both pigs and llamas.",

Based on the SEM study, experimental infection with MERS\u2010CoV in pigs was associated with a severe ciliary loss in the nasal turbinates in the early phase of the infection (days 2 and 4 p.i.). Tracheal deciliation, in contrast, was observed at later time points (days 4 and 24 p.i.), being more severe on day 4 p.i. Bronchial ciliation was unaffected during the whole experiment. On the other hand, experimental infection of llamas with MERS\u2010CoV led to almost no effect on nasal, tracheal and bronchial ciliation. These results contrast with recent data generated in dromedary camels, in which ciliary loss was very prominent (Haverkamp et al., 2018). In fact, these authors observed that MERS\u2010CoV infected epithelial cells lost cilia and showed lack of apical DPP4 antigen, while the adjacent non\u2010infected cells retained the DPP4 staining. Such evidence was not observed in pigs (DPP4 was detected in the cytoplasm mainly, with a significant loss of cilia) and llamas (infected cells retained apical and cytoplasmic DPP4 labelling and no significant cilia loss occurred) of this study. Ciliary loss of the upper respiratory tract has also been described in other viral infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u2010CoV in humans (Nicholls et al., 2003), respiratory syncytial virus in humans (Jumat et al., 2015), influenza virus in humans and ferrets (Zeng et al., 2013) and canine respiratory coronavirus in dogs (Mitchell et al., 2013). A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain such ciliary loss, including direct destruction of the ciliary apparatus, ionic variations during respiratory viral attachment and replication stages, damage through regulating the production of oxidizing metabolites, and apoptosis (Jumat et al., 2015; Mall, 2008; Vareille, Kieninger, Edwards, & Regamey, 2011). Therefore, the severe ciliary loss observed in nasal turbinates of pigs from this study was probably due to a bystander effect, since a very low amount of MERS\u2010CoV antigen and RNA was found in these affected turbinates.",

To date, decisive factors that restrict further replication of MERS\u2010CoV in the hosts are still poorly understood. It cannot be excluded that strong innate and/or adaptive immune responses may be responsible for virus clearance. In lymphoid tissues of both species (in the pigs only in the BALT), a limited number of cells were stained positive for MERS\u2010CoV antigen. Noteworthy, these cells had the morphology of dendritic cells (DCs). MERS\u2010CoV has been reported to productively infect human DCs in vitro, which can also serve as a vector for viral dissemination within the body (Chu et al., 2014). However, human DCs can secrete interferons (IFNs) and then trigger a potent innate/adaptive response upon MERS\u2010CoV infection (Scheuplein et al., 2015). Thus, those DC\u2010like cells could interfere with viral replication by releasing cytokines, like type I IFNs, or delivering antigens to other immune cells at the time MERS\u2010CoV reaches this area (Scheuplein et al., 2015). Future studies on this topic are therefore required to verify whether these cells are effectively DCs and if they are able to express DPP4 at the surface before infection.",

            "text": "Obtained results suggest the possibility that, besides DPP4, other surface molecules may facilitate virus entry; the potential absence or minimal expression of these latter putative molecules in pigs could be a cause for lower virus replication compared to llamas. Chan et al. (2016) estimated that carcinoembryonic antigen\u2010related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is an important surface attachment factor that facilitates entry of MERS\u2010CoV in vitro. More recent evidence suggests that the speed and efficiency of viral antigen to attach the host cell is accelerated by an entry complex that includes DPP4, a CoV\u2010activating transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the tetraspanin Cd9 (Earnest et al., 2017). In their study, mice transfected with the human DPP4 gene became significantly less susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV infection after silencing Cd9 or TMPRSS2 with small RNAs. Furthermore, MERS\u2010CoV was reported to bind to sialic acid (Sia) and depletion of this molecule led to inhibition of MERS\u2010CoV entry in Calu\u20103 human airway cells (Li et al., 2017). In consequence, it is possible that DPP4 is not the single host determinant for the virus entry, at least for some animal species. Another study has demonstrated that horses express DPP4 in the respiratory tract, but no viral RNA was detected (Vergara\u2010Alert et al., 2017) upon MERS\u2010CoV inoculation, suggesting the presence of host factors such as glycosyls (Peck et al., 2015) that block the entry of MERS\u2010CoV. Nevertheless, whether or not DPP4 is the only functional receptor for MERS\u2010CoV remains to be investigated in susceptible animals. Our observations and analyses will need to be further validated as some questions still remain. For instance, it is not known why ciliary loss did not occur in llamas despite the much higher amount of virus than in the pig. Moreover, Haverkamp et al. (2018) demonstrated down\u2010regulation of surface DPP4 upon MERs\u2010CoV infection, but this was not observed in llamas, since most infected cells still retained DPP4 on its cell surface.",

However, based on our observations, DPP4 may not be the single host determinant in regulating virus entry in respiratory cells of pigs and lymphoid tissues of both species. Although pigs showed a significant expression of DPP4 (mostly in the cell cytoplasm), the number of cells permissive for MERS\u2010CoV in this species was lower than that of llamas.",
