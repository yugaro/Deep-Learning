It appears to be involved in the antigenicity demonstrated by the virus-induced immune responses of the host. As the most abundant protein in the virion of coronaviruses, the M protein may also be one of the key components in viral assembly and morphogenesis, involved in regulation of replication and packing the genomic RNA into viral particles 4., 5..",

It is located between Codons 19-98 in the ORF. Its overall features are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1, Fig. 2. The first TM domain (TMI) is composed of 19 a.a. residues (Codons 19-37). The non-polar, neutral amino acids account for a substantial fraction (83%) of the total domain, making it strongly hydrophobic (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The second domain (TMII) is between Codons 50-72 (23 residues), with 81% non-polar, neutral residues, and with physiochemical features similar to TMI. A lipoprotein attachment site for prokaryotic membrane is identified at Codon 53 in TMII. The first inter-TM segment between TMI and TMII has a high probability of being located in the interior. A signal peptide of 39 a.a. residues in length with a likely cleavage site between Codons 39 and 40 (AYS-NR) is predicted within the first inter-TM segment between TMI and TMII. The TMIII domain is located between Codons 76\u201398 (23 residues), with 68.2% non-polar, neutral residues, and thus is not as hydrophobic as the other two. The segment between TMII and TMIII is possibly located in the exterior. A lipoprotein attachment site for prokaryotic membrane is predicted at Codon 75 in this segment or at its boundary with TMIII Figure 3.",

It should be emphasized that all the mutations were only detected from one of the isolate genomes, and should not be taken as the equivalent of the evolution rate. We have re-estimated this rate with a simple alternative: since 16 sequences of the M protein have been used, a reasonable approximation for this mutation rate might be 0.03% (4/666\u00d716).

            "text": "Two other substitutions have been identified, each from a single isolate, in TMI and TMII, respectively. The former (T/G) is a transversion that leads to a residue substitution from Phe to Cys. The latter is a C/T transition leading to residue substitution from Ala to Val. Both Phe and Cys are neutral and weakly acidic with the same pI (pI 5.6). Phe is non-polar (zero charge) and absolutely hydrophobic, whereas Cys is polar and also absolutely hydrophobic. It is expected that the subregional pI (pI 5.60), non-polarity (zero charge) and hydrophilicity (10.5%) will remain unchanged, but the hydrophobicity of TMI might be affected (73.7-68.4%), decreasing the stability to certain extent. It is generally accepted that the hydrophobicity is related to the stability of the membrane structure, and thus might attract the interaction between the virus-origin M protein and the host-origin membrane.",

Therefore, no change is predicted concerning the subregional pI (pI 7.90), hydrophilicity (9.10%), (+) charge (4.50%), (-) charge (0) in TMII by the substitution. The only effect would be the change of hydrophobicity (63.6-68.2%), which would also affect the membrane structure by increasing its stability. The fourth substitution is a T/C transition leading to a Ser/Pro change. Both Ser and Pro are neutral and have the same pI (pI 5.6), but Ser is absolutely hydrophilic. The only predicted change is a slight alteration in the subregional hydrophilicity (45.4-44.7%), leaving all the other physical and chemical features unaltered. However, hydrophilicity should be important to this interior region if the internal environment is taken into consideration.",

            "text": "The comparative analysis of the genome sequences of 361 ssRNA viruses demonstrates that the M protein is uniquely present in the seventeen currently available coronavirus genomes. The analysis on the published genome sequences of ten members in the family Coronaviridae has placed the SARS virus outside the three known groups. According to the unrooted phylogenetic tree we have proposed based on the M protein, the BCoV in Group 3 would be relatively closer to SARS-CoV. This finding for the M protein differs from the phylogenetic analysis for other structural proteins of the SARS-CoV 6., 14., 15.. However, our data based on the M protein, together with other ORFs and the entire genome, lend strong support to the conclusion that SARS-CoV is a variant in Coronaviridae that has been existing in a reservoir somewhere in nature, perhaps in non-human animal(s), for a long time and has only recently found a new pathway to humans. If SARS-CoV has been latent in its original host, it might have recently gained an extraordinarily strong selective advantage to expand its host range, establishing a high virulence to humans, through or after passing into humans. Alternatively, the virus might have passed back and forth from wild animals to humans for some time, lately changing from a wild form to a potent one.",
