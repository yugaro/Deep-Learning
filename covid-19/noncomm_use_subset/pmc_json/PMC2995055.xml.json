The current view is that the downstream RNA element forms a physical barrier that causes a fraction of ribosomes to stall in their translocation step and puts tension on the mRNA\u2013tRNA interaction (15). This tension is relieved by realignment of A-site and P-site tRNAs in the 5\u2032-direction, whereafter the ribosome resumes translation in the \u22121 reading frame. Several data also point to a role for the E-site tRNA in stimulating frameshifting (16,17).",

            "text": "In general, a pseudoknot is more efficient in stimulating frameshifting than a hairpin of the same sequence (18, R.C.L. Olsthoorn unpublished data). This difference is likely related to a higher thermodynamic stability of the pseudoknot. Indeed, from thermodynamic analyses it appears that pseudoknots are more stable than their hairpin counterparts (19\u201321). Recent studies employing mechanical \u2018pulling\u2019 of frameshifter pseudoknots have shown a correlation between the mechanical strength of a pseudoknot and its frameshifting capacity (13,14) and influence of major groove and minor groove triplex structures (22). The higher strength of a pseudoknot can be primarily attributed to the formation of base triples between the lower stem S1 and loop 2 (Figure 1), making it more resistant against unwinding by an elongating ribosome (15,23). Base triples in the pseudoknots of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (24), Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV-1) (21) and Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) (25) have been shown to play an essential role in frameshifting.\n",

Base triples at these positions, stabilizing the S1/S2 junction have been recognized to be essential for frameshifting in other pseudoknots as well, be it with different hydrogen bond patterns (21,24,25,29). To provide additional evidence for the importance of the specific interactions between L2 and S1 in frameshifting, we accumulated a number of the adverse mutations into one construct. Therefore, a construct was designed with a pyrimidine-rich L2 sequence CUCUCGUG (SF229, \u2018L2-mut\u2019) that included the A21U, C24U, A26G and A28G mutations.

To this end we substituted G for C20, removed C24 and restored the G2\u2013C18 and C10\u2013G32 base pairs, as present in the SRV-1 pseudoknot. To our surprise this mutant was 3-fold less active in frameshifting than the parent SF206 pseudoknot. Close inspection of the sequence indicated a possible alternative structure containing two hairpins competing with pseudoknot formation (Figure 2). To prevent this alternative structure, we mutated C10\u2013G32 to U\u2013A (SF223) or G\u2013C (SF224). In these constructs the U\u2013A pair is predicted to destabilize the 4- and 7-bp hairpins and the G\u2013C base pair is predicted to completely disrupt the 4-bp hairpin and destabilize the 7-bp hairpin. Frameshift levels of SF224 increased approximately 2-fold compared to SF222, while that of SF223 increased more than 3-fold suggesting that the role of alternative structure formation should not be underestimated.\n",

Of course, when introducing such dramatic changes, one should also consider their effects on the pseudoknot structure and stability. In SF348 most of the base triples are presumably lost and a 3-nt loop crossing the minor groove of stem S1 may not be sterically and thermodynamically favorable.

The NMR pseudoknot showed \u223c11% of frameshifting (SF402, data not shown) that increased to \u223c19% in combination with the UUUAAAC slippery sequence (SF404). This 1.7-fold increase is very similar to the previously reported increase from 23 to 40% in vitro for changing the slippery sequence (28). Mutations were made in the pseudoknot of plasmid SF404. As can be seen in Figure 3, the substitutions had almost the same effect on frameshifting in vivo as in vitro. The only exception seems to be the effect of enlarging L2, which is consistently more detrimental for frameshifting in vivo than in vitro. This could be due to refolding kinetics of the pseudoknot, what in combination with heavier ribosomal traffic in vivo would result in a lower fraction of properly folded pseudoknots.

This is quite remarkable as the mutated sequence should still be able to fold as a pseudoknot, but apparently critical stem\u2013loop interactions are lacking. As found for other frameshifter pseudoknots, the composition and length of L2 can greatly influence frameshifting. Most frameshifter pseudoknots have adenine-rich L2 loops, presumably because of the need for stable triple helix formation, which is best performed by adenosine\u2019s N1 and C6-amino groups (2).",

For instance in the BWYV and PEMV-1 pseudoknots, S2 is only three base pairs but this is compensated by an additional triple between L1 and S2. The high number of triples in luteovirus pseudoknots may explain why for instance the ScLYV pseudoknot with a relatively high number of A\u2013U base pairs in the bottom of S1 is still capable of inducing \u223c15% of frameshifting (25). On the other hand, when S1 is increased to 11 base pairs, triple interactions do not seem to contribute anymore as frameshifting becomes independent of the sequence of L2 (C-H.

In these models a pseudoknot trapped in the mRNA entry tunnel resists mechanical unwinding, which causes the ribosome to pause. Indeed, recent optical tweezers experiments, in which rupture forces of RNAs are measured by pulling 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends apart, showed a correlation between frameshifting and mechanical strength of the pseudoknot and confirmed a positive effect of base triple interactions on frame shift efficiency (13,14,22). Frameshifting by the trapped pseudoknot is thought to be either passive, by stalling the ribosome for a sufficient amount of time, or active, by building up tension at the mRNA\u2013tRNA interface by a counteracting ribosome, which can be relieved by a \u22121 frameshift (15). Observations that ribosomes can stall for seconds to minutes without frameshifting to occur (35) and pausing appears to be necessary, but not sufficient for frameshifting (36,37), rather point to an active role. Although it now seems mechanical resistance to RNA unfolding is the key to ribosomal frameshifting, how the ribosome exactly \u2018chokes\u2019 on such a structure is still far from being understood. Remaining questions are for instance if torsional restraint of the pseudoknot resisting ribosomal unwinding is essential (23), whether the pseudoknot truly plays an active role in for instance overbending the tRNA in the P-site (12) and at which stage of translational elongation frameshifting actually occurs.",

            "text": "One should also keep in mind the possible formation of alternative structures that can affect the frameshifting efficiency by lowering the fraction of properly folded pseudoknots. This possibility has not been investigated in detail but our own data (Figure 2) suggest that this may be a relevant issue. Especially during heavy ribosomal traffic, as may be the case in vivo, fast and correct refolding of pseudoknots could be an important parameter for frameshifting. Under such circumstances it is conceivable that a hairpin is more preferred as it probably refolds faster than a pseudoknot. A recent study on the HIV-1 frameshift signal has shown that a decrease in the translation initiation frequency can lead to an increase in the frequency of frameshifting (38). Also a previous study in yeast has shown a correlation between frameshifting and translation initiation frequency (36). Our data with the enlargement of L2 also hint at a possible role for folding kinetics.",
