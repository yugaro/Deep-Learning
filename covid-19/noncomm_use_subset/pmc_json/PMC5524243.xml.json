On auscultation, a cardiac gallop rhythm was detected, associated with an increased respiratory rate and normal breathing sounds. Systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) measured by the Doppler method was repeatedly high (mean 280 mmHg; three measurements performed daily on four separate days). Urinalysis (specific gravity, urinary dipstick and urinary sediment examination) revealed a urine specific gravity of 1.020, without further abnormalities. The urinary protein:creatinine ratio was 0.2. Complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry results are summarised in Table 1. CBC values revealed mild, non-regenerative anaemia (haematocrit 28%; reference interval [RI] 30\u201345%). Biochemistry revealed hyperproteinaemia (97 g/l; RI 60\u201380 g/l), hypoalbuminaemia (23 g/l; RI 25\u201339 g/l) and hyperglobulinaemia of 74 g/l. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a spike in the gamma region (47 g/l; RI 12\u201332 g/l) (Figure 1a). The appearance of this spike was suggestive of oligoclonal gammopathy. Serum agar gel immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis identified the M-protein as monoclonal IgG lambda type (Figure 1b). To rule out potential infectious causes of monoclonal gammopathy, serological testing for feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test; IDEXX Laboratories) was undertaken. This was negative, as was indirect immunofluorescence for feline coronavirus and Ehrlichia species antibodies.",

            "text": "Three-view thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasonography showed moderate asymmetric hypertrophy with subaortic remodelling and fibrosis, most probably due to increased SAP. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a left adrenal mass (Figure 2), without evidence of vascular invasion. The right adrenal gland was unremarkable. Low-dose dexamethasone suppression (0.1 mg/kg IV) and urine cortisol: creatinine ratio tests were performed to investigate the adrenal activity and a possible inappropriate secretion of hormones by the adrenal mass, but both were within the RIs. Several serum potassium concentrations were repeatedly within the RI and, consequently, excessive aldosterone production was not investigated. Cytological examination of the adrenal mass, obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), revealed clusters of intact cells showing polygonal nuclei with prominent nucleoli, pale cytoplasm and fine, basophilic, intracytoplasmic granules (Figure 3a,b). Furthermore, in order to investigate a potential haematopoietic neoplastic origin of the monoclonal gammopathy, a bone marrow aspirate from the right wing of the ilium was obtained under sedation using a Mallarm\u00e9 trocar (18 G). Bone marrow cytology indicated an increased myeloid:erythroid ratio due to erythroid hypoplasia, associated with an increase in plasma cells (14%; RI <10%).1 Plasma cells showed small mature-appearing nuclei and a large cytoplasm filled with one large Golgi apparatus (Figure 4). No malignant changes in the morphology of plasma cells were detected. To investigate a plasmacytic invasion of the spleen and liver, cytological samples were obtained by ultrasound-guided FNA, which revealed no abnormalities. PCR for Leishmania infantum and Mycoplasma species in both blood and bone marrow specimens were negative. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM), associated with a probable phaeochromocytoma, was made.",

Positive reactions of some adrenal cells to IL-6 antibodies were achieved only at a high antibody titre, which is not consistent with IL-6 secretion (Figure 5a,b).",

            "text": "In humans, biological diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma is based on documenting abnormal regulation of catecholamines.6 Thus, one of the initial tests performed in human medicine is direct measurement of catecholamines (eg, epinephrine) or catecholamine breakdown products (eg, metanephrines or urine vanillylmandelic acid) in the blood or urine via high-performance liquid chromatography. In veterinary medicine, a prospective study investigated plasma free metanephrine and normetanephrine levels in healthy cats, cats with non-adrenal disease and in a cat with a suspected phaeochromocytoma, demonstrating an elevated normetanephrine level in the latter.5 However, a normetanephrine cut-off level to diagnose phaeochromocytoma in cats has not yet been developed and tests for phaeochromocytomas are not commercially available in veterinary medicine.6 Nuclear imaging via nuclear scintigraphy or positron emission tomography can also be performed to achieve a preoperative diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. Nuclear combines functional activity with anatomical localisation, allowing identification of the presence of metastasis and multifocal disease.6 Unfortunately, this technique is not easily available in veterinary patients, and in this case the owner declined referral to a specialist centre in Paris (France). Finally, the catecholamine suppression test can also be performed in humans to diagnose phaeochromocytoma, but this test lacks sensitivity and specificity and has not been previously evaluated in domestic animals.6",

Because hypertension is present in >70% of cats with an adrenal tumour,7 further causes of a unilateral adrenal mass were considered in the differential diagnosis of this patient. In companion animals, adrenal tumours may be primary or metastatic, and arise from different areas of the adrenal gland.8 Primary neoplastic proliferations of the adrenal cortex are classified as adrenal adenoma and adrenal carcinoma, depending on their biological behaviour, whereas adrenal medullary tumours are called phaeochromocytomas.9 Furthermore, adrenal tumours may be functionally active, secreting inappropriate amounts of one or more hormones and causing tumour-related syndromes (eg, hyperadrenocorticism or hyperaldosteronism). In contrast, a variety of vague and non-specific clinical signs attributed to excessive secretion of catecholamines have been reported in patients with phaeochromocytomas.4,9,10 In the current case, a hormone-secreting cortical adrenal neoplasia was ruled out on the basis of normal low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests and several normal serum potassium concentrations. Furthermore, a medullary origin of the adrenal lesion was suspected on the basis of the cytological results of FNA. In the examined cat, the suspicion of phaeochromocytoma was strongly supported by the cytology of the mass. A recent study demonstrated that cytology in the characterisation of a primary adrenal mass is useful in discriminating cortical from medullary tumours and it may represent a rapid and easy method to correctly diagnose an adrenal tumour.8 However, the risk of complications associated with FNA of an adrenal tumour should be considered. Indeed, potential severe and even fatal side effects (eg, pain, uncontrolled haemorrhage or severe hypertensive crisis) could arise from the sudden release of catecholamines, especially during FNA of phaeocromocytomas.8",

Furthermore, current published recommendations for determining a diagnosis of MM in animals require two of the following four criteria: (1) bone marrow plasmacytosis, (2) monoclonal gammopathy based on serum protein electrophoresis, (3) osteolysis and (4) light-chain (Bence-Jones) proteinuria.12 The cat examined herein met two (bone marrow plasmacytosis and monoclonal gammopathy) of these criteria. Moreover, of the 27 published feline myeloma cases with immunoelectrophoresis results, 22 had IgG gammopathies, as described in the cat in the present report.11,13",

In recent years, increasing evidence indicates that this tumour also secretes cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-\u03b3.2 IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine, originally cloned as a B-cell stimulatory factor, that is overexpressed in response to injury, inflammation and infection. Its role in cancer is complex, and autocrine and paracrine mechanisms are involved, including the promotion of the survival, migration and drug resistance of malignant plasma cells in MM.12,17 Experimentally, deregulated expression of the IL-6 gene can trigger polyclonal plasmacytosis resulting in the generation of a malignant monoclonal plasmacytoma in mice.18 Consistent with this theory, IL-6-deficient mice do not develop plasmacytoma, indicating the critical role played by IL-6 in murine plasmacytomagenesis.19 In humans, IL-6 is physiologically expressed in the adrenal cortex, but not in the adrenal medulla and a number of clinical cases have reported the presence of IL-6-producing adrenal phaeochromocytoma.2 Ectopic IL-6 production by phaeochromocytomas has been demonstrated by elevated serum levels of IL-6 or by immunohistochemical IL-6 expression on specimens of the resected adrenal tumours.2\u20134 Furthermore, a fall in serum IL-6 levels after adrenalectomy has been reported.2",

Moreover, high serum levels of IL-6 is one of the most common causes of drug-resistance in patients suffering from MM,17 and it may explain the absence of clinical and biological improvement in the present cat after two different treatments for MM. Unfortunately, the serum concentration of IL-6 was not measured in the cat examined herein, and adrenal secretion was not confirmed by immunocytochemistry with feline antibodies against IL-6. The poor adrenal IL-6 secretion in the current case may be due to the inadequate pretreatment of cytological samples, such as a lack of storage at \u221220\u00b0C before immunocytochemistry, as recommended by the manufacturer.",
