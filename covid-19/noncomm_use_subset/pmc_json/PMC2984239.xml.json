All cells were tested to ensure there was no contamination with mycoplasma. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For the SILAC experiment, A549 cells were cultured in DMEM containing either 13C-labeled arginine and 2D-labeled lysine (R6K4-Medium) or 13C- and 15N-labeled arginine and lysine (R10K8-Heavy) for a minimum of seven population doublings. Labeled media were obtained from Dundee Cell Products Ltd. and were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Mock-infected supernatant was prepared using R6K4-Medium-labeled Hep2 cells. The HRSV A2 strain was propagated in R10K8-Heavy-labeled Hep2 cells. Virus was harvested 4 days postinfection and passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. Virus titer was calculated for A549 cells using an antibody-based methylcellulose plaque assay technique based on previous studies (34, 35). Plaques were visualized using a goat anti-HRSV primary antibody (ab20745) and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (ab6741) that were both obtained from Abcam. The latter antibody was detected using the peroxidase substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Pierce). A549 cells were then grown in 500-cm2 dishes until 60% confluent and mock-infected/infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1.",

Trypsin-digested peptides were separated using an Ultimate U3000 (Dionex Corp.) nanoflow LC system consisting of a solvent degasser, micro- and nanoflow pumps, flow control module, UV detector, and a thermostated autosampler. 10 \u03bcl of sample (a total of 2 \u03bcg) was loaded with a constant flow of 20 \u03bcl/min onto a PepMap C18 trap column (0.3-mm inner diameter \u00d7 5 mm; Dionex Corp.). After trap enrichment, peptides were eluted off onto a PepMap C18 nanocolumn (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 15 cm; Dionex Corp.) with a linear gradient of 5\u201335% solvent B (90% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 65 min with a constant flow of 300 nl/min. The HPLC system was coupled to an Linear quadrupole trap Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems). The spray voltage was set to 1.2 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 200 \u00b0C. Full-scan MS survey spectra (m/z 335\u20131800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 after accumulation of 500,000 ions. The five most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 30 ms) in the LTQ after the accumulation of 10,000 ions. Maximal filling times were 1,000 ms for the full scans and 150 ms for the MS/MS scans. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled, and all unassigned charge states as well as singly charged species were rejected. The dynamic exclusion list was restricted to a maximum of 500 entries with a maximum retention period of 90 s and a relative mass window of 10 ppm. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy (38). The data were acquired using Xcalibur software.",

The derived peak list was searched with the Mascot search engine (version 2.1.04; Matrix Science, London, UK) against a concatenated database combining 80,412 proteins from the International Protein Index human protein database version 3.6 (forward database) and the reversed sequences of all proteins (reverse database). Alternatively, database searches were done using Mascot (Matrix Science) as the database search engine, and the results were saved as a peptide summary before quantification using MSQuant (http://msquant.sourceforge.net/). Parameters allowed included up to three missed cleavages and two labeled amino acids (arginine and lysine). Initial mass deviation of the precursor and fragment ions were up to 7 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The minimum required peptide length was set to six amino acids. To pass statistical evaluation, posterior error probability (PEP) for peptide identification (MS/MS spectra) should be below or equal to 0.1. The required false positive rate was set to 5% at the peptide level. False positive rates or PEPs for peptides were calculated by recording the Mascot score and peptide sequence length-dependent histograms of forward and reverse hits separately and then using Bayes' theorem in deriving the probability of a false identification for a given top scoring peptide. At the protein level, the false discovery rate was calculated as the product of the PEP of the peptides of a protein where only peptides with distinct sequences were taken into account. If a group of identified peptide sequences belongs to multiple proteins and these proteins cannot be distinguished with no unique peptide reported, these proteins are reported as a protein group in MaxQuant. Proteins were quantified if at least one MaxQuant-quantifiable SILAC pair was present. Identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1% with a minimum of two quantifiable peptides. The set value for false positive rate/PEP at the peptide level ensures that the worst identified peptide has a probability of 0.05 of being false, and proteins are sorted by the product of the false positive rates of their peptides where only peptides with distinct sequences are recognized. During the search, proteins are successively included starting with the best identified proteins until a false discovery rate of 1% is reached, an estimation based on the fraction of reverse protein hits. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin allowing for cleavage N-terminal to proline and between aspartic acid and proline. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as a fixed modification; N-acetyl protein and oxidation of methionine were searched as variable modifications.",

Networks were generated using data sets containing gene identifiers and corresponding expression values that were uploaded into the application. Each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. A cutoff of 2.0 was set to identify genes whose expression was significantly differentially regulated. These genes, called focus genes, were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Networks of these focus genes were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. Graphical representations of the molecular relationships between genes/gene products were generated. Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Human, mouse, and rat orthologs of a gene are stored as separate objects in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base but are represented as a single node in the network. The intensity of the node color indicates the increased (red) or decreased (green) abundance. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Canonical pathway analysis utilizes well characterized metabolic and cell signaling pathways that are generated prior to data input and on which identified proteins are overlaid.",

Cells were enriched into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, which were validated by the detection of characteristic cellular (tubulin for the cytoplasm and lamin B1 for the nucleus) (Fig. 1C) and viral (Fig. 1D) marker proteins that were enriched in the respective fractions. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay.

From this, we hypothesized that the mitochondrial permeability transition pores had an altered function in HRSV-infected cells. To test this hypothesis, we made use of a live cell mitochondrial assay in which green fluorescent (calcein AM) dye is maintained in healthy mitochondria (which are also stained red with a MitoTracker dye). As a positive control, cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, which results in mitochondrial pore activation from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and subsequent loss of green fluorescence. In this live cell assay, it was not possible to use indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to visualize HRSV-infected cells (as the cells could not be made permeable to allow antibody penetration). Therefore, cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 2 to ensure that at least 70% of cells were infected at 24 h postinfection, the assay point (after the experiment, cells were fixed, and infection status confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. 2)). The data illustrated that in mock-infected cells the majority of the cells were stained green and red, indicating functional mitochondria (Fig. 9). In control cells treated with ionomycin, all of the cells were stained red with no green signal, indicating mitochondrial pore activation (Fig. 9). In HRSV-infected cells, there was a greater population of predominately red cells than predominately green cells, indicating greater mitochondrial pore activation in cell populations infected with HRSV in comparison with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 9).",

In addition, in HRSV-infected A549 cells, cell cycle arrest has been observed; however, the abundance of cell cycle regulatory complexes was not elucidated (18). Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from mock- and HRSV-infected cells indicated that Cdc2 was less abundant in the nuclear fraction in HRSV-infected cells (confirming the quantitative proteomic analysis) and that cyclins D2, A, E, and B1 were also less abundant (Fig. 11).

ND10 abundance and localization were investigated in HRSV-infected through the use of its major constituent, PML. An antibody that recognized all PML isoforms was applied to both Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Western blot analysis indicated that more PML isoforms were present in the nuclear fraction from HRSV-infected cells when compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 11). In the cytoplasmic fraction in HRSV-infected cells, a decreased abundance in the number of PML isoforms was observed when compared with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 11). The indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy data indicated that there were a greater number of ND10s present in the HRSV-infected cells when compared with mock infected-cells (Fig. 12). This observation included not only cells that were positively identified as infected but also the bystander cells (Fig. 12). This result was in contrast to a previous proteomic analysis of the nucleus from HRSV-infected A549 cells proposing that PML protein is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 24 h postinfection (26). In the current study, further analysis of HRSV-infected cells at 36 h postinfection indicated that PML remained predominately in the nucleus with no change in the number of ND10s in mock-infected cells (Fig. 12). To confirm that PML was not redistributed to the cytoplasm in mock-infected and HRSV-infected cells in our experimental system, overexpression analysis of two PML isoforms, recombinant FLAG-tagged PML-I and PML-II (40), was used (Fig. 12). The data indicated that both tagged fusion proteins remained localized to the nucleus at 24 h postinfection, which was the same in mock-infected cells (Fig. 12).",

Although the data tables show a quantitative ratio between HRSV proteins and mock-infected cells, in reality this should be infinite and is a result of comparison with cellular peptides of similar sequence. HRSV replication is cytoplasmic, therefore, the potential presence of viral proteins in the nucleus may be considered an unusual observation. However, HRSV M protein has been shown to localize to the nucleus and contains nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking signals (9, 67\u201369). The presence of viral proteins in the nuclear fraction either may have been an artifact of the fractionation procedure or may reflect the subcellular localization of a protein. To investigate whether the HRSV P and M2-1 proteins were present in the nucleus, overexpression analysis was utilized where these proteins were expressed as C-terminal fluorescent fusion proteins tagged with cyan (ECFP). The direct fluorescence confocal microscopy analysis indicated that both the P and the M2-1 proteins localized predominately to the cytoplasm, but some fluorescent signal was observed in the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 13). This correlates with the identification of these proteins in the nuclear fraction. ECFP was localized throughout the cell. Note that ECFP and the fusion proteins have been false colored green postimage capture for increased clarity.",

The laboratory-adapted HRSV A2 strain used in animal-based pathogenesis studies (75) was used in the SILAC study because it replicated to high efficiency in the A549 model cell line. These cells have been used extensively in HRSV studies because of their ability to retain features of alveolar cells (76). Proteins were identified and quantified at 24 h postinfection as this time point occurs prior to the appearance of a major cytopathic effect; thus, the majority of cells remain viable for downstream processing. In addition, this time point is commonly used in HRSV studies and therefore allows comparison with the previously published data. For example, microarray studies (24) of HRSV-infected cells have demonstrated a high return of data at this time point. In total, 606 cellular proteins were identified in the nuclear fraction, and 534 proteins were identified in the cytoplasmic fraction along with six viral proteins.",

Also, nuclear proteins with increased and decreased abundances between mock and infected cells were validated experimentally using alternative techniques on the same and different samples, e.g. the increased abundance of PML versus the decreased abundance of nucleolin and similar levels of marker proteins such as lamin B (e.g. Figs. 1 and 11).

In the pathway analysis, STAT1 was linked to IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 (Fig. 5). STAT1 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation, and HRSV uses distinct mechanisms to either impair STAT1 phosphorylation or increase phosphorylation of STAT1\u03b2 (a STAT1 variant) to repress IFN expression (80). HRSV proteins NS1 and NS2 strongly inhibit IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 by preventing the phosphorylation of the IFN regulatory factor-3 (15, 16). However, the molecular pathology of HRSV infection and the mechanisms by which it circumvents IFN are still not fully understood. Different strains of HRSV can differ in their ability to block IFN type I synthesis, and likewise, cell line choice is important in such pathway studies. Therefore, a comparison of different HRSV strains using differential isotopic labeling and different cell lines (e.g. macrophages) may prove useful in further characterizing HRSV infection.",

Whether mitochondria are affected by HRSV infection has not been characterized previously. Quantitative proteomic analysis coupled to IPA identified changes in mitochondrial proteins in HRSV-infected cells. The localization and abundance of representative mitochondrial proteins (highlighted during data analysis) were then investigated in separate experiments using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. It is of interest to note that in this analysis mitochondrial proteins were also detected in nuclear fractions. This could have been an artifact of the purification process, or it could have been due to the tubular structures that contain mitochondria and project into the nucleus (82). Certainly, the indirect immunofluorescence confocal analysis of Tom20 distribution in HRSV-infected cells reflected the latter hypothesis (supplemental Fig. 1).",

IPA defines mitochondrial dysfunction as anything (genetic or environmental) that interferes with the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing the superoxide to overpower the antioxidant system. ROS are potent elements in the mitochondrial antimicrobial defense system, and mitochondria may participate in the innate immune response by triggering the production of ROS (81). However, as is the case in the IFN pathway, microbes may have evolved strategies to manipulate such defense mechanisms, and any alterations in mitochondrial function may affect the immune response of cells to virus infection. For example, HCV is able to block the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (found on the outer membrane of the mitochondria) downstream signaling pathway, which leads to the expression of IFN \u03b2, thereby enabling HCV to evade host immunity (85). Furthermore, human cytomegalovirus has been shown to perturb many cellular processes that promote the release of proapoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c (86).",

Subsequent activation of the signaling complex is followed by translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus and the activation of associated genes (88). HRSV has been shown to activate cytoplasmic mitogen- and stress-related kinase 1 (MSK1) via ROS, and in turn, MSK1 mediates NF-\u03baB activity (88). Although the molecular basis for ROS-dependent MSK1 activation is unknown, the identification of pathways that control NF-\u03baB activation in response to HRSV infection may be useful in finding a way to attenuate the proinflammatory effects of HRSV and lung inflammation (88). Bioinformatics analysis of quantitative proteomics data may highlight different pathways that lead to NF-\u03baB activation in HRSV-infected cells (e.g. Figs. 4 and 5).",

Also of interest was the ablation of nucleolin (Fig. 11), which under normal growth conditions is highly expressed in proliferating cells (97) and is responsible for correct mitosis and controlled centrosome duplication (98, 99). The ablation of cell cycle regulatory complexes may account for the observed cell cycle arrest reported in HRSV-infected primary and A549 cells (18) and in cells infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (100). A number of viruses with RNA genomes whose site of RNA synthesis is the cytoplasm have been reported to interact with the cell cycle to promote cellular conditions more favorable for viral replication.

In this study, the quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that two of the most common and most studied nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and nucleophosmin, were ablated in HRSV-infected cells. For nucleolin, this was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 11), demonstrating the strength of the SILAC approach. Recently, it has been shown that lamin B1 interacts with nucleophosmin to maintain nucleolar structure for ribosome biogenesis (107). However, the loss of lamin B1 resulted in the breakdown of the nucleolus (107). Our analysis indicated that lamin B1 was potentially cleaved and depleted in HRSV-infected cells (Fig. 1C). However, the observation of degradation of lamin B was antibody-dependent (e.g. compare Fig. 1C with Fig. 11). Nucleolin was also observed to decrease in human metapneumovirus-infected cells using 2DE (27).",

ND10 constituents TAR and RAD50 were significantly decreased in abundance, but the major constituent, the PML protein, was not detected by LC-MS/MS. Because PML is an ND10 marker protein, it was used to validate the abundance and localization of ND10s in HRSV-infected cells. Western blot analysis indicated that the abundance of PML protein increased in the nucleus of HRSV-infected cells. This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy that showed an increased number of ND10s in the nucleus of HRSV-infected cells. These results are in contrast to a previous report for A549 cells infected with HRSV A2 strain (26). However, in the current analysis, indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy positively identified HRSV-infected cells and showed that tagged PML-I and PML-II proteins remain in the nucleus. However, this does not preclude that certain isoforms may be more abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Other negative sense RNA viruses have also been shown to interact with ND10s. For example, in rabies virus-infected cells, ND10s became larger, and the expression of rabies virus P protein led to the sequestration of PML in the cytoplasm, which resulted in an increased viral titer, presumably through the ablation of an antiviral response (108). Along with the observations described above and the contrasting results from previous studies, it is important to note that ND10s are dynamic nuclear structures whose composition is highly dependent on the metabolic state of the cell.",

            "text": "Several virus-encoded proteins were identified in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. For the nuclear fraction (supplemental Table 6), one of these could be predicted, the M protein, as this has well characterized nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking (69, 109, 110). Overexpression analysis using fluorescently labeled M2-1 and P proteins indicated that these proteins were present in the nucleus but predominately localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 13), and hence this could explain why they were identified in both fractions. The F protein was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction only (supplemental Table 7), which may be due to the association of this protein with the cellular membrane. Viral proteins could not be quantified in this experimental system as there were no unlabeled virus peptides of known amount in the isolated fractions with which to compare. However, the comparison of viral peptides with mammalian peptides (some of which may have similar sequences) does allow some putative observations to be made regarding the relative amounts of the identified viral proteins. Examination of the viral protein ratios in the cytoplasmic fraction (supplemental Table 7) indicated that the relative protein abundance of the identified proteins reflected their position on the genome and hence the abundance of their corresponding mRNA. This correlates with the relationship between gene position on the genome and abundance of mRNA in the Mononegavirales (111\u2013113). This may also explain why no L protein was detected in the LC-MS/MS analysis as this is the least abundant virus protein in HRSV-infected cells. Several other HRSV-encoded proteins were not detected, including the NS-2, SH, and G proteins. This may be a function of their post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation of G protein) or indicative of protein stability and turnover inside a cell.",

Nuclei are stained blue with Hoechst. All mitochondria are stained red with MitoTracker (A), healthy cells are also stained green with calcein AM (B), which is concentrated in the mitochondria. Merged images are also presented (C). Positive control cells were treated with ionomycin to allow the entry of excess calcium into the cells to trigger mitochondrial pore activation, which leads to the release of calcein AM and therefore the loss of green florescence. A large proportion of mitochondria in HRSV-infected cells were stained red and only weakly green, indicating that HRSV infection affected mitochondrial transition pore activity. Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm. Note that indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate that cells were infected with HRSV, and these data are presented in supplemental Fig. 2.",
