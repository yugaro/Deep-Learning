In particular, in cases of pandemic outbreak in local communities, epidemiology plays a central role in managing infected individuals and preventing disease propagation [2]. On May 20, 2015, after the confirmatory diagnosis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [3], preventive medicine residents convened for an epidemic survey in early June 2015 to respond to worries about the risk of in-hospital infections spreading to local communities. On June 26, an anonymous interview with a preventive medicine resident was published in the media [4].",
