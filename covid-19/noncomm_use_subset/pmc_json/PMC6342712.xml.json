AECOPD leads to deterioration in quality of life and substantial morbidity and mortality.345 A major cause of AECOPD is bacterial or viral infection.678 Bacterial and viral infections have regional variability, and epidemiological characteristics should be considered during treatment. However, most previous analyses of bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD have been conducted in Western countries;9101112 studies in Asia are scarce and unclear. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze bacterial and viral identification rates in AECOPD in Korea based on epidemiological factors.",

Along with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, in our study, P. aeruginosa was identified as a major AECOPD pathogen. Previous studies have found that P. aeruginosa identification rates increase with GOLD stage and that higher S. pneumoniae identification rates are associated with comorbidity.17 Our results agree with these previous studies: we found that P. aeruginosa identification increased as the GOLD stage increased. The correlation between S. pneumoniae identification rate and GOLD stage seems to be due to high comorbidity at more advanced GOLD stages. The low identification rate of M. catarrhalis may be due to regional differences. For other reasons, M. catarrhalis may not be cultured better than other bacteria, so the identification rate may be low.",

The high influenza identification rates in our study are likely due to influenza epidemics in Korea in 2014 and 2015; 51 of the 91 events with influenza virus identification occurred during this time. These results suggest that rhinovirus is the virus most commonly identified with AECOPD unless there is another virus outbreak.",

For example, we evaluated pneumococcal vaccination, but did not find influenza vaccination coverage for all patients. Thus, we could not analyze the effect of influenza vaccination at the time of the influenza epidemic. Also, chest computed tomography was performed only in some cases, so it was not applicable to all events. Second, colonization could not be distinguished in the analysis of detection; in particular, it would have been advantageous if there had been previous or follow-up data from sputum culture. Third, influenza rapid antigen test was performed only in 247 (33.6%) events. Additionally, it was mainly performed only in the epidemic season. We think this would have affected the analysis of seasonal variation. Fourth, the phenotype of COPD might have a major impact on pathogen identification. However, through retrospective data, it was difficult to accurately identify COPD phenotype. Thus, we could not analyze according to COPD phenotype.
