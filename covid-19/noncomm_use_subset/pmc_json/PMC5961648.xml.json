A recent study conducted in the US found that respiratory viruses were much more common in children hospitalised with pneumonia than bacteria, with at least one virus detected in 65% of enrolled children.4 A multicentre study conducted in four developing countries also noted that even though S. pneumonia was associated with increased risk of pneumonia deaths, respiratory viruses were frequently associated with severe, hypoxic pneumonia.5 6\n",

The seven main admission diagnoses included: bronchopneumonia (32%), suspected sepsis (28%), bronchiolitis (17%), pneumonia (12%), pertussis-like cough (7%), asthma/reactive airway disease (5%) and febrile seizure (3%). The median LOS was 5 days, with 9% admitted to the ICU, 4% on MV and 32% receiving oxygen therapy (table 1). Of the 2688 (85%) subjects who were tested for vitamin D levels, 49% had vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL). The median level was 16.5 ng/mL (IQR 5.2\u201326)(table 1). During the study period, 31 (1%) children died (table 1). Among the 31 subjects, 21 (68%) had at least one respiratory virus detected (eight HRV positive; five RSV positive; one AdV positive; one influenza positive; and six coinfection cases).",

In contrast, virus-positive children were more likely to present with severe lower respiratory tract infection as indicated by the higher frequency of cough and shortness of breath, wheezing, flaring and cyanosis on examination, and increased oxygen therapy requirement. These clinical differences were dramatic and may serve as helpful clinical predictors of likely viral diagnosis prior to the availability of more definitive laboratory findings. In addition, 68% of the children who died had at least one respiratory virus detected, noting the association of severe disease with viral detection in these children.

RSV-only children were more likely to present with cough and shortness of breath; have flaring, wheezing and cyanosis on physical examination; and less likely to present with fever, diarrhoea and seizures compared with other respiratory viruses. Interestingly, the clinical presentations of RSV and HMPV were indistinguishable, other than age: HMPV-only children were older. A surveillance study of RSV-positive children in India found the presence of cough, fast breathing, crepitation and hypoxia to be independent predictors of RSV infection.39 Durani et al found the combination of cough, wheezing and retractions to be good predictors of RSV infection.39 40 Our study also found cough to be a strong predictor of the presence of virus, including RSV. In addition, the RSV-positive children in our study were more likely to require oxygen therapy, suggesting these children presented with more severe LRT disease. We also documented RSV being more severe than other viruses in a previous pilot study.14 Therefore, if preventive measures such as vaccines become available for RSV, Jordanian children would benefit greatly.",

Universally, younger age, UMC and the diagnosis of pneumonia were associated with all five illness severity markers. Lack of breast feeding was associated with all severity markers except for MV. Therefore, the promotion of breast feeding is an essential public health intervention for reducing the severity of respiratory illnesses. Our study found that lower vitamin D levels were associated with longer LOS and a higher probability of oxygen use. Two studies identified an association between lower infant vitamin D levels and increased risk of ARI, and one study found lower levels of vitamin D in children admitted into the ICU with bronchiolitis or pneumonia compared with those admitted to the wards.41\u201343 Observational evidence supports further interventional studies to determine if vitamin D supplementation could reduce respiratory illness severity in this population.",

Prior to this study, very few large prospective studies of respiratory viral diseases of children have been completed in this setting. Our ongoing surveillance enabled us to test samples during the time of the first MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, confirming that none of the children in this study were admitted with MERS-CoV.44 Our state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics give one of the best assessments to date of respiratory viral aetiologies of hospitalised children in any MENA nation. Limitations included having only 5 days of surveillance per week, though we did weighted analysis in our population burden estimates to adjust for missing days. Also, we did not test for all respiratory viruses (eg, parainfluenza 4, non-MERS coronaviruses), so the viral burden is underestimated. Lastly, this study is limited to children from low-income and middle-income population seeking care at a single health facility in Amman, and thus is not generalisable to the entire population of Jordan.",
