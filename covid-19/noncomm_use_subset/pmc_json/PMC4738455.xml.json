            "text": "There are a number of methodological issues to consider in the interpretation of our findings. Participants were randomized within 48 h of symptom onset to ensure treatment was initiated early in the course of the illness. The small amount of paracetamol or NSAID used by most participants before randomization is unlikely to have had a clinically significant effect on the natural course of their illness. Additionally, there was variable time between symptom onset and study entry; however, this is likely to mirror what will happen should patients seek medical advice for flu\u2010like symptoms. Despite a pre\u2010determined randomization schedule, there was a larger number of participants in the placebo group who had chronic respiratory conditions and/or had the seasonal influenza vaccine compared with the control group. It is unclear to what extent these characteristics may have influenced participant symptom scores, if at all. All participants were admitted to the CTU for the first 48 h of the trial period. Consequently for that period, there was full compliance with the study drug and temperature recordings were complete and accurate. Adherence with medication after discharge was approximately 90% in both groups. All participants were administered a 5\u2010day course of oseltamivir in accordance with international recommendations for management of influenza infection at the time of protocol development.28 Although this may have reduced the illness severity and viral load, the effect of oseltamivir would have been the same across both the paracetamol and placebo groups.29 However, it is possible that its use may have reduced our ability to detect a significant difference between randomized treatments for the primary outcome. Most patients were recruited following attendance at their primary healthcare clinic with an influenza\u2010like illness and so the findings are generalizable to both the management of otherwise healthy adults with an influenza\u2010like illness, and to those with proven influenza infection in the community.",

            "text": "There are a number of alternative explanations for our finding of no difference between randomized groups apart from that, in fact, paracetamol does not affect influenza outcomes. The study did not recruit 80 PCR\u2010confirmed cases despite screening with a rapid antigen testing kit with a reported diagnostic specificity of 96\u2013100% for both influenza A and B.23 All Baseline pernasal samples contained human RNA, indicating that this lower than expected result was unlikely to be due to poor sampling technique. It is possible that the specificity of the rapid antigen test was reduced in this study due to cross reactivity with other respiratory viruses.23 The lower than anticipated number of PCR\u2010positive influenza cases might be expected to reduce statistical power to detect differences, but the SD of the primary outcome variable was substantially less than anticipated from past research. The CI for the difference excluded the difference we expected to detect, that is half the magnitude of that seen with anti\u2010viral treatment of influenza,27 but it may be that a smaller difference in the primary outcome variable is still clinically relevant. In terms of the clinical outcome variables, paracetamol did not have any significant anti\u2010pyretic effect whether measured as daily maximum, daily mean or AUC of temperature over 48 h. This may be due in part to the modest febrile response in the participants, the mean maximum temperature on Day 1 in the influenza PCR\u2010positive group was 38.1\u00b0C, falling to 37.4\u00b0C by Day 2. Due to its lack of anti\u2010pyretic efficacy in our sample, we were unable to test our hypothesis that the suppression of fever with paracetamol in influenza infection may be harmful.",
