            "text": "For stem cell researchers, establishment of new humanembryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and development of culture conditions for maintenance of the established cell lines efficiently and stably are fundamental areas of research, requiring further development and detailed investigations. In addition, recent studies have examined the clinical applications of stem cells from cell therapy products in regenerative medicine, highlighting the importance of securing hESCs with clinical grade quality (Hovatta, 2006; Tannenbaum et al., 2012). Thus, several groups have attempted to establish hESC lines, remove animal-derived components from culture conditions, and maintain xeno-free conditions. Reports on the establishment of new hESC lines and successful culture under xeno-free culture conditions have been published (Ellerstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Crook et al., 2007; Ilic et al., 2012; Tannenbaum et al., 2012), and many efforts have been made to develop appropriate stem cell culture protocols for the use of hESCs in clinical applications, from establishment and culture to freezing and thawing (Skottman et al., 2007).",

However, concerns remain regarding the potential risks of cell line contamination by unknown components secreted from these animal derived materials, therefore, studies have been performed to overcome these challenges (Soong et al., 2013). For example, studies have examined the replacement of mouse derived fibroblasts with human tissue-derived feeder cells, such as human foreskin fibroblasts, fetal muscle fibroblasts (Richards et al., 2002), umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ding et al., 2012), marrow stromal cells (Havasi et al., 2013), and placental cells (Park et al., 2011). Additionally, researchers have also attempted the development of extracellular matrix and xeno-free medium, which can be used in feeder-free conditions for cultures without feeder cells (Wang et al., 2013). There have also been continuous efforts to maintain hESCs efficiently and stably and establish new cell lines in the developed culture conditions.",

            "text": "Human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs) have been used forprenatal genetic diagnosis to examine the possibility of fetal abnormalities, these cells can be easily obtained from pregnant women through second midtrimester amniocentesis (Prusa & Hengstschlager, 2002). Although few studies have characterized the various types of cells found in amniotic fluids, cells in amniotic fluids have been shown to be capable of differentiating into three germ layer cells. Thus, these cells have the potential for applications as materials for studies of neuronal differentiation or as stem cells (Prusa & Hengstschlager, 2002; Kook et al., 2006). Amniotic fluid derived stem cells have intermediate characteristics between hESCs and adult stem cells and express markers such as CD29, CD90, and CD105, which are expressed in bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. These cells also express markers of the undifferentiated state of hES cells, including Oct-4, Nanog, SSEA-4, and TRA1-81 (Bajek et al., 2014). In particular, Oct-4, a representative marker for undifferentiated hESCs, has been shown to be expressed in 90% of amniotic fluidderived stem cells (Prusa et al., 2003). Moreover, hAFCs have been shown to have higher reprogramming efficiency for establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) than somatic cells (Galende et al., 2010). In addition, in studies using hAFCs as feeder cells, Kim et al. (2004) successfully cultured hESCs using hAFCs as feeder cells instead of mouse derived fibroblasts, which are more commonly used. Other reports have also described the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of hESCs using human amniotic fluid cell-derived stem cells as feeder cells without the addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Ma et al., 2014), and new hESC lines have been established using amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells as feeder cells (Soong et al., 2013).",

An optimal volume of dPBS was then added to the cell pellet to resuspend, and the cells were subjected to analysis using a flow cytometer (FACSAria; BD Bioscience).",
