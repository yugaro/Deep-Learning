To confirm that complement activation occurs in vivo after WNV infection, we compared the levels of functional C3 and C4 in the serum of naive and WNV-infected C57BL/6 mice using an erythrocyte hemolysis assay (Fig. 1 A). On day 2 after WNV infection, a time point at which peak viremia was observed (see Fig. 3 A), a 2.5-fold decrease in C3 functional activity (P < 0.0001) was measured. Significant decreases, albeit smaller, were also noted on days 4 and 6 after infection (P \u2264 0.02). C4 activity (23) was also reduced at day 2 after WNV infection (Fig. 1 B). As the catabolism of C3 in vivo generates a C3dg fragment, Western blot analysis was performed on serum from WNV-infected mice with an anti-C3 antibody. Increased levels of the 38-kD C3dg fragment were observed in serum at day 2 after WNV infection (Fig. 1 C); the identity of this fragment was confirmed by its absence from serum of congenic C3-deficient mice. Collectively, our experiments suggest that WNV infection activates and consumes complement within days of infection.",

            "text": "To assess the mechanism of complement-mediated protection from WNV disease and the function of the classical, classical and lectin, or alternative pathways of complement activation in control of WNV, we evaluated morbidity and mortality in wild-type and congenic C1q\u2212/\u2212, C4\u2212/\u2212, factor D (fD)\u2212/\u2212, and factor B (fB)\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice. Mice in all groups exhibited clinical signs of infection including weight loss, hunching, fur ruffling, and decreased activity. However, mice deficient in any individual complement activation pathway were more vulnerable to infection and had higher mortality rates compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Whereas only 35% of wild-type C57BL/6 mice succumbed to infection, 83% of C1q\u2212/\u2212 (n = 60, P < 0.0001), 100% of C4\u2212/\u2212 (n = 38, P < 0.0001), 74% of fD\u2212/\u2212, (n = 57, P = 0.0004), and 96% of fB\u2212/\u2212 (n = 51, P < 0.0001) mice died after WNV infection (Fig. 2). Not all complement deficiencies were associated with enhanced susceptibility as infection of mice deficient in the C5a receptor (C5aR) survived at rates similar to wild-type mice (n = 50, P = 0.5). Although both fB and fD are components of the alternative pathway, a deficiency of fB caused greater mortality after WNV infection (P < 0.0001), possibly caused by residual alternative pathway activation in fD\u2212/\u2212 mice (24). Overall, the C4\u2212/\u2212 and fB\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to lethal WNV infection than either C1q\u2212/\u2212 or fD\u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.0001). The increased susceptibility of fB\u2212/\u2212 mice was also reflected by a decrease in the mean time to death from 10.9 \u00b1 0.3 d for wild-type mice to 9.7 \u00b1 0.1 d for the fB\u2212/\u2212 mice (P = 0.002). No statistically significant decrease in the mean time to death was observed for C4\u2212/\u2212 (10.3 \u00b1 0.2 d), C1q\u2212/\u2212 (11.7 \u00b1 0.2 d), or fD\u2212/\u2212 (11.0 \u00b1 0.2 d) mice. Thus, deficiencies in all complement activation pathways resulted in increased mortality after WNV infection. The most severe phenotypes were observed in mice that had a combined deficiency in the classical and lectin pathways (C4\u2212/\u2212) or a complete deficiency in the alternative pathway (fB\u2212/\u2212).",

To assess which complement pathway contributed to viral clearance in the spleen, we evaluated WNV burden in C1q\u2212/\u2212, C4\u2212/\u2212, fD\u2212/\u2212, and fB\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3 B). Compared with wild-type mice, we observed a slight delay in clearance of WNV from the spleen in a subset of fD\u2212/\u2212 and fB\u2212/\u2212 mice. At day 6 after infection, 58% (7 of 12) and 73% (11 of 15) of fD\u2212/\u2212 and fB\u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively, had detectable infectious WNV in the spleen, whereas only 33% (5 of 15) of wild-type mice had infectious virus at this time point. On day 8 after infection 57% (8 of 14) of fB\u2212/\u2212 mice still had measurable infectious virus in the spleen, whereas it was no longer detectable in wild-type mice. Surprisingly, infectious virus was never recovered from the spleens of C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice at any point during the time course (n \u2265 11 for each time point). Consistent with this, at the peak of viral replication in the spleen, 120,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected by quantitative RT-PCR from the spleens of C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3 C, P = 0.002). The peak viral burden and number of positive samples in the spleen also was significantly lower in the absence of C4 (P = 0.04). Whereas 80% (12 of 15) of wild-type spleen samples were positive for infectious virus at day 4 after infection, only 30% (4 of 12) from C4\u2212/\u2212 mice had infectious virus. Moreover, on day 6 after infection 60,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected in spleens of C4\u2212/\u2212 mice (P = 0.001). Thus, in the spleen, classical pathway activation appears to be necessary for productive infection, whereas the alternative pathway contributes in part to its rapid clearance of WNV.",

Previous studies in mice indicated that F4/80+ macrophages and CD19+ B cells were the principal cellular targets for WNV infection in the spleen (18). Because infection of C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in normal viremia, we hypothesized that virus must replicate in another peripheral tissue. Studies from our group and others (14, 26) indicate that draining lymph nodes are an early site of WNV replication. To determine one possible source of viremia in the C1q\u2212/\u2212 and C4\u2212/\u2212 animals, viral burden in the inguinal lymph nodes was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3 D). Equivalent levels of WNV RNA were detected on the first and second days after infection in wild-type, C1q\u2212/\u2212, and C4\u2212/\u2212 mice (P \u2265 0.8). However, by 3 d after infection fourfold less WNV RNA was found in the draining inguinal lymph nodes of C1q (P = 0.05) and C4\u2212/\u2212 mice (P = 0.04) compared with wild-type mice.",

Intense antigen staining in complement-deficient mice was observed in neurons of the cerebellum, brain stem, brain base, and cortex.

Consistent with previous studies (14\u201316), in wild-type mice WNV-specific IgM was detected by day 4 after infection (Fig. 6 A), and WNV-specific IgG was detected by day 6 after infection (Fig. 6 B). Near normal development of anti-WNV IgG and IgM was observed in the absence of alternative pathway activation in fD\u2212/\u2212 and fB\u2212/\u2212 mice (P \u2265 0.1). Additionally, in fB\u2212/\u2212 mice, we observed no significant difference in the isotype specificity (Fig. 6 C) or neutralizing activity of the WNV antibody response (Fig. 6 D). In contrast, the development of WNV-specific IgG was delayed in C1q\u2212/\u2212 and C4\u2212/\u2212 mice, with three- to fourfold reduced titers on day 8 after infection, respectively (P \u2264 0.0003). However, this deficit disappeared by day 10, as normal levels of anti-WNV IgG were subsequently observed (P \u2265 0.5). Throughout the time course the anti-WNV IgM response was reduced only in the absence of C4 (P \u2264 0.03). Collectively, our serologic data establish that the IgM response to WNV is C4 dependent, yet C1q, fD, and fB independent, suggesting a possible role for the lectin pathway. Consistent with this, C1q\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 fD\u2212/\u2212 mice had normal anti-WNV IgM and IgG responses on day 10 after infection (unpublished data; P = 0.7).",

Although the studies in C3\u2212/\u2212 mice were consistent with models of complement-dependent control of other viral infections including HSV, influenza, and LCMV (2\u20134, 31, 32), no investigation had systematically addressed how the different activation pathways coordinate protection. Our experiments demonstrate that all complement activation pathways are required for control of severe WNV disease. The virologic experiments suggest that complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. As many complement proteins are constitutively expressed within the CNS (33) and up-regulated after infection with other neurotropic viruses (34\u201336), complement activation in the CNS could be critical for destruction of viral particles or virus-infected neuronal cells. Alternatively, the defects observed in priming adaptive immune responses to WNV in complement-deficient mice (see below) may result in earlier spread and/or decreased clearance.",

Because IgM fixes complement by the classical pathway and WNV particles can be neutralized efficiently in vitro by exogenous rabbit complement (20), we anticipated increased viremia in C1q\u2212/\u2212 and C4\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, we only observed a transient increase in viremia in C4\u2212/\u2212 mice, which may be secondary to depressed levels of antiviral IgM in these mice. Viral clearance from serum is known to correlate with the induction of WNV-specific IgM at days 4 and 6 after infection (15). The relatively low viral neutralizing activity of serum complement in mice may be caused by the reduced function of the mouse classical pathway C5 convertase (37, 38). Our prior in vivo experiments support this, as antibody-mediated protection from WNV disease was not significantly attenuated in C1q\u2212/\u2212 or C4\u2212/\u2212 mice (39).",

TNF-\u03b1 generation in peripheral lymphoid tissues has been suggested to modulate blood-brain barrier permeability and WNV neuroinvasion (40). Notably, genetic disruption or antibody blockade of alternative pathway activation or CR3 function significantly inhibited TNF-\u03b1 secretion from human or murine leukocytes after exposure to group B Streptococcus (41).

            "text": "A surprising result was the requirement of C1q and C4 for normal levels of WNV infection in the spleen and draining lymph node. In the absence of C1q, infectious virus was not detected in the spleen, and 100,000-fold less WNV RNA was measured on day 6 after infection. Additionally, WNV infection of the draining inguinal lymph nodes was reduced in the absence of C1q beginning on day 3 after infection. In the absence of C4, fewer spleen samples contained less infectious virus than those of wild-type animals, and less WNV RNA was detected in the spleen and draining inguinal lymph node. At first glance, this observation appears consistent with earlier in vitro studies that showed complement and antiviral IgM enhanced WNV infection in macrophages (42, 43). Although these studies suggested that IgM-dependent fixation of C3 split products (e.g., C3b, C3dg, or iC3b) on WNV enhanced infection, our prior studies with secreted IgM\u2212/\u2212 or C3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed normal WNV splenic infection (15, 20). Based on this, we speculate that C1q directly or indirectly interacts with WNV to facilitate splenic infection. Direct C1q interaction with viral glycoproteins has been observed for HIV-1, human T cell lymphotropic virus-1, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (6), and C1q-dependent enhancement of infection has been demonstrated in vitro for both HIV-1 and Ebola viruses (44, 45). Our data clearly establishes that WNV infection in the spleen does not significantly contribute to viremia or CNS seeding. Somewhat paradoxically, decreased productive splenic infection did not dramatically alter the induction of primary antiviral B and T cell immune responses to WNV. This apparently contrasts with studies which show that follicular localization in the spleen is complement dependent and required for the development of antibody responses to soluble antigen (46) and vesicular stomatitis virus (2). For WNV, we hypothesize that T and B cell priming may occur in other secondary lymphoid tissues. Alternatively, despite an absence of productive viral infection in the spleen, sufficient complement-dependent antigen trapping occurs for antigen presentation and priming of antiviral adaptive immune responses.",

Because near normal anti-WNV antibody responses were observed in fB\u2212/\u2212 or fD\u2212/\u2212 mice, activation of the alternative pathway is not required for priming the antibody response against WNV. Our results are consistent with studies which demonstrate that fB\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit normal B cell priming to T cell\u2013independent and T cell\u2013dependent antigens (47). We observed a transient delay in the development of antiviral IgG but not IgM in the absence of C1q, consistent with previous reports of defects in primary T cell\u2013dependent IgG but not IgM responses in C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice (46). Our data suggests the contribution of the classical pathway to anti-WNV antibody priming is relatively minor and could be secondary to the defect observed in splenic infection. The most severe defect in anti-WNV antibody development was observed in the absence of C4, where IgM responses were blunted and IgG responses were delayed. Since the C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited normal IgM responses, the C4-dependent lectin pathway could play an important role in priming the antiviral IgM against WNV. Although no study has directly evaluated the contribution of the lectin pathway to antiviral antibody responses, this idea is consistent with work on HSV in which both the primary and memory antiviral humoral responses were blunted in C4\u2212/\u2212 mice (3, 48). Defects in MBL function and lectin pathway activation have been suggested to predispose individuals to HIV-1 (49), HSV-2 (7), severe acute respiratory syndrome (50), and chronic hepatitis B infection (51). We speculate that the lectin pathway may have an essential role in the priming of humoral responses against some pathogens.",

            "text": "An emerging literature has suggested an essential role for complement in priming antiviral T cell immunity. T cell responses to influenza and LCMV require C3 activation (4, 27), possibly by enhancing antigen uptake and presentation or T cell trafficking to infected organs. Efficient CD8+ CTL responses are critical for development of WNV immunity (16, 17), and complement-deficient mice with the greatest mortality (i.e., C4\u2212/\u2212 and fB\u2212/\u2212) had associated T cell activation and trafficking deficits. Because previous studies with soluble antigens suggested that C1q-mediated immune complex trapping contributed to T cell priming (46, 52), we expected C1q\u2212/\u2212 mice to have T cell deficits; however, this was not observed. We speculate that WNV antigen uptake and presentation may be reduced in the absence of lectin pathway activity and/or C4b deposition. Lectin pathway recognition induces opsonization of influenza virus, HSV-2, and HIV-1 (53), and C4b deposition and CR1 binding can activate and enhance antigen presentation in human cells (54). Nonetheless, the defects in antiviral T cell responses in C4\u2212/\u2212 mice could be indirect and attributed to the depressed anti-WNV IgM responses and decreased immune complex clearance. Although more experiments are necessary to identify the exact mechanism, our study is novel as it describes a role for C4 in T cell function after viral infection.",

This may attenuate C3b-directed targeting, uptake, and presentation of WNV in lymphoid tissues (2, 4, 27). Alternatively, C3b engagement of CR3 may promote an appropriate cytokine environment for antiviral T cell priming: production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 were reduced by treatment of human monocytes with CR3 blocking antibodies or natural CR3 ligands (57).",

Our study expands the current knowledge of the in vivo mechanisms of complement-mediated antiviral immunity, and in particular suggests that activation of complement by distinct pathways may control pathogens by triggering different effector arms of antiviral immunity. A limitation of our study is that it does not address the precise mechanism by which the three complement activation pathways stimulate different adaptive immune responses; the differences could be because of quantitative or qualitative variation in the generation of C3 or C5 activation fragments. Regardless, a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV given that antibody and CD8+ T cells both are essential for protection (14, 16, 17). It is intriguing to consider that severe WNV infection in humans, which occurs infrequently (\u223c1/150), could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. Although complete deficiencies of complement proteins are rare, heterozygous deficiencies of C4 and MBL are common (59) and have been associated with an increased risk of viral diseases (30, 49, 51, 60). As therapies against WNV become available, it will be important to target high-risk populations. Depressed levels of complement proteins or reduced complement activity could explain why some seemingly healthy patients develop severe disease after WNV infection. Genetic studies that evaluate the risk factors of neuroinvasive WNV infection in humans should include an analysis of common complement gene allelic polymorphisms.",
