            "text": "Alternative splicing is a major mechanism for regulating biological systems, producing multiple messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein isoforms. Some of these isoforms have distinct or even opposing functions (19). Many genes in the immune system have been found to be alternatively spliced (20\u201322) and a growing number of human diseases are associated with aberrant splicing of the genes (23\u201325). However, few studies to date have identified the mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing in the immune system. While CD200 exists as a single copy gene, data from Borriello et al. (26), confirmed by our experiments (27), have reported that a splice variant of CD200 exists. Although exon 2 deletion of CD200 caused by alternative splicing results in a frame shift and premature translational termination, we noted the existence of a downstream ATG start codon in a perfect Kozak context (27). When the first start codon is followed shortly by a terminator codon and creates a small open reading frame (ORF; 5\u2032-mini-cistron), the 40S ribosomal subunit remains bound to the mRNA, resumes scanning, and potentially reinitiates at the next ATG codon downstream (28). It is known that the NH2-terminal region of CD200 is important for its biological interaction with CD200Rs (29,30), and translation from the second ATG start codon would produce a truncated form of CD200 (CD200tr) lacking the NH2-terminal 43 amino acids which includes regions important for the interaction with CD200Rs. Indeed, our previous studies have shown that expressed CD200tr is a functional antagonist to CD200 (27).",

In the present study, we have explored the mechanism controlling CD200 alternative splicing and show that SF2/ASF regulates CD200 alternative splicing through its direct binding to an ESE site in exon 2 of this gene. The level of SF2/ASF determines the alternative splicing patterns in different tissues or cells. Interestingly, in a mouse model of viral infection, we detected for the first time that the normal splicing pattern of CD200 was reversed in the lung tissue of A/J mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain I (MHV-1), following an increase in expression of SF2/ASF in this MHV-1 susceptible mouse strain.",

Two mixtures were prepared: mix 1 (20 \u03bcl) contained 0.1 \u03bcg of DNA template, 0.5 mM dNTP mix and 0.5 \u03bcm of sense and antisense primers; mix 2 (30 \u03bcl) included elongase enzyme mix and 1\u00d7 long-distance PCR buffer A and B provided by the manufacturer (the ratio of buffer A and B is 1:4). The sense primer started with the NotI cleavage site and the antisense primer with the SalI site. The sequences of the primers were shown in Table 1. Mix 1 and mix 2 were combined on ice and subject to PCR under the following condition: 94\u00b0C for 1 min followed by three cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 59\u00b0C for 30 s, 69\u00b0C for 20 min, and then 29 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 69\u00b0C for 20 min. The final extension was 69\u00b0C for 15 min. The 12-kb CD200 fragment was displayed on 0.7% TAE-agarose gel and purified using QIAEX II Agarose Gel Extraction Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. For more efficient elution of the large size DNA, the final incubation time was extended to 30 min at 60\u00b0C. The gel-purified DNA fragment was verified by restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI, BglII, EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, and DNA sequencing. For ligation to pcDNA 3.0 expression vector, the CD200 fragment was digested with NotI and SalI. Meanwhile, pcDNA 3.0 expression vector was digested with NotI and XhoI. Afterwards, pcDNA 3.0 vector was further dephosphorylated to remove the 5\u2032 phosphoryl group, preventing the vector from self-ligation. The enzyme-treated CD200 fragment and pcDNA 3.0 were ligated, at a molar ratio of 3:1, using 400 U of T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 1\u00d7 T4 ligase buffer in a 20-\u03bcl reaction at 16\u00b0C overnight.",

RT-PCR was performed using a sense primer located in exon 1 and an antisense primer present in exon 3. Interestingly, we observed a reversal of the normal CD200 splicing pattern in lung tissues of A/J mice postinfection (Figure 7A). Real-time RT-PCR provided a more accurate result of this phenomenon. We documented that the full-length CD200 was increased after viral infection and was 2-fold higher at 36 h postinfection compared with that before infection (Figure 7B). All the susceptible A/J mice were dead at 96 h postinfection. In contrast, the relative ratio of full-length to truncated CD200 did not change in infected C57BL/6J mice (Figure 7C and D).

The relative expression of the two isoforms of CD200 is of interest, given our recent evidence that the truncated form (CD200tr) can antagonize the functional suppression induced by full-length CD200 (27). Although Borriello et al. (26) reported no change in the alternative splicing pattern of murine CD200 in lymphoid tissue after stimulation by Con A or LPS in vivo, in our in vivo studies of mouse lung tissues before/after infection of MHV-1 virus we observed that, unlike in the natural condition, following viral infection the expression of total CD200 increased in lung of both MHV-1 susceptible A/J mice and MHV-1-resistant C57BL/6 mice. However, the splicing pattern of CD200 is reversed only in A/J mice, with the full-length transcript, capable of inducing immunosuppresion, becoming the predominant one. In contrast, for C57BL/6J, an MHV-1-resistant mouse strain, no change in the splicing pattern of CD200 was seen in the lung. This result importantly demonstrates that only the splicing pattern, but not the total transcription level, of CD200 determines the murine immune response to MHV-1 and is consistent with the hypothesis that the shift in the balance of expression of CD200/CD200tr to decrease expression of the truncated product allowing CD200 to function in its immunosuppressive role, possibly contributing to the increased susceptibility to MHV-1 in the A/J mice. Further studies showed an increased expression of SF2/ASF in A/J mice postinfection and the increase in SF2/ASF occurred prior to increased full-length CD200, strongly suggesting that the regulation of alternative splicing of CD200 is mediated by SF2/ASF. It remains to be determined what viral proteins of MHV-1 have this effect and how the proteins regulate expression of SF2/ASF. Our studies suggest that viruses escape elimination by the host\u2019s immune system not only through producing viral proteins which mimic CD200 but also by inducing host CD200 expression and reducing expression of the antagonist CD200tr. Posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA stability, plays an important role for gene expression (42). Whether the increase of full-length CD200 in A/J mice is also due to differential mRNA stability cannot be ruled out.",

Our data suggest that regulation of expression of alternative splicing transcripts may be important in controlling susceptibility to viral infection. An ESE in exon 2 of CD200 is a binding site for a splicing regulatory protein, SF2/ASF, which we have shown to control the alternative splicing pattern of CD200. A drug-mediated manipulation of alternative splicing has recently been reported which includes modulation of SF2/ASF (25). It would be of interest to know if this drug treatment alters the expression ratio of CD200 to CD200tr and thereby produces change in immune function.",
