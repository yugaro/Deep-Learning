It is ideal for students in clinical clerkship to enhance their clinical competence by having a good number of opportunities to experience direct interviews with actual patients. Practically, however, medical schools in Korea would find it difficult to provide an adequate number of opportunities of balanced clinical training with real patients on major clinical presentations because the number of actual patients that students may encounter is limited and the patients are not standardized. This lack of opportunity is then further exacerbated since protecting patients' rights is an essential part of health services. Difficulty of acquiring patient permission about a student practice further limits the range of clinical trainings that can be implemented. Current undergraduate medical education tends to be theoretical and textbook-oriented while classes would hardly provide either simulated or actual patients. Regarding clinical clerkship involving inpatients or outpatients, the diagnosis is usually given by other experts prior to a student-patient encounter, thus restricting students' clinical experience in a disease-oriented manner. This renders the clinical experience partly inadequate to provide authentic training in clinical reasoning skills and competency.",

These three rotation groups then completed a CPX preparation program, which was developed under the supervision of the department of medical education, as an alternative independent curriculum. The details of this preparation program are shown in Table 1. The other 11 rotation groups had completed their respective community medicine training were not subject to any organized CPX-related training program.

Medical education using standardized patients ensures high receptiveness, not only for educators, but also medical students, while culminating in higher effectiveness compared to that using role play.7) However, considerable amount of time that the standardized patients require in their training, coupled with a high cost, means that the clinical skills test within the KMLE is prepared mainly with an attempt to enhance clinical competency using role play. This study was conducted to examine the effect of role play practice on CPX ability of students and to determine which sections of CPX were improved by role play. The results showed that role play practice of students before CPX effectively improved score, specifically for some sections of history taking. Scores on other sections, such as patient-physician interaction and physical examination, were not significantly different compared to the control group. CPX scores increased with repeated usage of cases in a previous study, which improvement may be explained by an increase in test awareness of examinees or a maturation effect during an additional period of educational experience.8) In this study, students' sectional CPX scores improved in all areas within each group over 5 months of clinical clerkship. However, only competency of history taking improved more among the intervention group compared with the control group. We may interpret it as the educational module being the focus on history taking with case specificity. Other educational interventions, such as a general hands-on skill course for comprehensive physical exam skills, were ineffective enough to affect the area score.",

Scores on physical exam section were not increased in this study, possibly for several reasons. First, there is a lack of feedback from colleagues. Studies have revealed a lack of dependability from the result of the colleague-evaluations that had been taken domestically, which resulted in the following: the lack of differentiation between the students as they gave the same scores because of mental pressure; evaluating colleagues based on their general impressions rather than objective criteria, etc.1112) It is plausible that students found it difficult to study all the necessary physical examinations correctly in those role play situations with their colleagues from the same departments. Female students in particular may be inevitably forced and restricted to playing their roles in a passive manner when acting as patients during a physical exam, which could work as a hindrance in effective experiential training. Moreover, the feedback from patientdoctor relations or physical exam may have lacked enough accuracy as it is more vulnerable to inaccurate observations from a less skilled observer; history taking shows the contrary, as its evaluations are rather simple and the stipulated checklist is written precisely. It may also be interpreted as the actual effectiveness of education was limited because the role play in the physical exam was not operated in the context of the cases, which includes a general physical exam. Second, there is a lack of self-evaluation during physical exam. Students lack experience in receiving appropriate feedback and performing selfevaluation on their clinical competency.13) Failure to recognize weaknesses in the physical exam section is probably one of the reasons why scores on physical exam were not improved.",

Smith15) defined history taking as \u201ca communication in which a patient can speak freely and a physician plays the role of an attentive listener to understand and appropriately respond to true wants and needs of the patient on the same level.\u201d This means that PPI can be improved by naturally listening to patients during history taking. While the increase in PPI scores through role play was only marginal in this study despite a significant increase in history taking scores, is possibly that students were unable to fully concentrate on interviewing the patients as they were focused on following the checklist, while the checklist-oriented learning ensured a desirable outcome in history taking. Lee et al.16) explained that since CPX is an examination, students have difficulty in empathizing with their patients because they only concentrate on achieving a correct diagnosis and perceive that patients are actors, thereby reducing empathy expression by students during interviews when compared with actual patients and the CPX interview. During patient-physician interactions, role play alone does not provide adequate training, while clinical practice involving standardized patients may prove to be rather more effective.",

Scores during history taking were noticeably improved for this item because the practiced cases were of the same clinical presentation as the case used during actual examination. Students practiced cases of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma for cough symptoms, while a case of tuberculosis appeared on the actual examination. Diverse diseases can be developed into CPX modules in the case of cough, and GERD is a key diagnosis to implicate the digestive system, unlike other cough problems (respiratory system). Therefore, this result suggests that scores may not increase unless role play practice is done on a wide variety of diseases for each item. However, this case specificity alone would not fully explain how the CPX results of the group, which underwent a preparation course, were higher than those of the group that did not undergo a preparation course. Training experiences would have led to acquiring relevant working knowledge and subsequent improvements in clinical competency in general.",

First, the scope of this study is limited to activities conducted within a single medical school, and thus carries inevitable restrictions when its findings are presented to a broader scope. Second, the long-term effects of CPX preparation education on the performance at the national examination could not be examined, as only the short-term effects were observed and examined. Research in the future must examine the effect of CPX preparation education on improving the result of the practice examination within the KMLE. Third, it was not feasible to determine which method of CPX education is the most effective among module development, role play, and physical examination. Future studies are therefore required and should include several medical schools with additional examinations of the effects of standardized education modules.",
