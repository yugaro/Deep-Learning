Loss of balance control decreases the ability and speed of patients' gait, especially in those with hemiplegia caused by brain damage. Fear of falling in these patients reduces their activity level and makes daily activities of living difficult for these patients. Therefore, improvements in balance control and mechanical movements are important treatment goals [1].",

Therefore, comprehensive, objective treatment methods are needed. Previous studies have reported on the relationship between gait ability, speed, and independence of performing daily activities from multiple angles. Physicians use various treatment methods and exercises, including trampoline training [2], visual feedback training [3], and sling exercise therapy for trunk muscles [456]. Along with the active development of rehabilitation equipment, physicians use many types of equipment that are already made in Korea in treatments to improve balance, including the iBalance (CyberMedic, Iksan, Korea) and Space Balance 3D (CyberMedic) systems. However, few studies exist on the actual effectiveness of this equipment, and established criteria to evaluate functional improvements are scarce. This study aimed to investigate whether the Spine Balance three-dimensional (3D) system, which was developed to strengthen the deep muscles of the vertebra via stabilization exercise of the lumbar spine, improves postural balance in patients with hemiplegia performing 3D rotational exercises. We expected that this exercise would increase trunk muscle strength and stabilize movement of the vertebra. In addition, this study aimed to study the improvement in gait and ability to carry out daily activities while proving the positive effects of using the Spine Balance 3D system's program and several balance control tests. The results were compared to those obtained with a Biodex Balance System [7], which is widely used for balance training, to prove its effectiveness.",

Thirty patients who met the requirements were chosen as subjects. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 15 to create experimental and control groups to be respectively treated using Spine Balance 3D (CyberMedic) and Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). The random distribution of the subjects into the experimental and control groups is based on a random allocation table in the order of registration of the subjects, and the process of patient recruitment took a total of 4 months. We conducted this prospective study at the Chonbuk National University Hospital, and we notified the subjects regarding the content of the study and obtained their written consent before the experiment was conducted.

The FRT indicated static balance, and the KFES-I measured the risk of falling. The patients performed TUG, a test that measures the time it takes a patient to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down, and a stopwatch was used to measure timing. We measured the time it takes a patient to walk a distance of 10 m marked by tapelines when performing the 10mWT, and sufficient space was provided before and after the 10 m region to allow acceleration and deceleration. The forward FRT was performed by measuring the difference between the locations of the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint of the unaffected side from a normal standing position and from a maximally forward-leaning position, and a 100 cm-long ruler was set horizontally at the acromion level to measure the difference. The patients placed both clavicles perpendicular to the long ruler lines on the wall to avoid error caused by the decrease in ipsilateral muscle strength. We separately measured the values for the affected and unaffected side in the lateral FRT. The lateral FRT measures the differences in the location of the metacarpophalangeal joints after abduction of the arm on the desired side from a natural upright position and from a laterally tilted trunk position. If the strength of the affected arm was not sufficiently strong, we measured the acromion locations instead. The Biodex Balance System and Spine Balance 3D system objectively evaluated the balance control. We used Biodex Balance System's evaluation program to conduct postural stability test with eyes open and closed, along with the limits of the stability test. We conducted the postural stability test by having the subjects maintain a relaxed standing position with eyes open and closed for 10 seconds each. We obtained three measurements from each condition to calculate the overall stability index, which reflected the stability as it approximates 0. We conducted the limits of the stability test on an easy level. We obtained three measurements to calculate the overall direction control score, which reflected a higher ability to control direction as the score decreased. Spine Balance 3D system's blind and open modes were used to evaluate the balance control. The difference between the blind mode and the open mode is defined as the ability to display the actual balance status on the screen by using the sensors attached to the back of the patient. The monitor displayed the actual balance status in the open mode whereas the screen turned black in the blind mode to restrict compensation. We increased the tilt in each of the eight directions to 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 by 2\u00b0/s and stopped for 5 seconds at the maximum tilt (15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0). The subjects maintained a certain trunk position, depending on the tilt, and the results were reported as the Balance Position Ratio (BRP), expressed as the percentage of deviation from reference for the direction and tilt measured using the trunk sensor system. A score close to 100% reflects a good trunk muscle strength.",

This study proves that treatment using the Biodex Balance System improves stability by fortifying core strength [16]. Treatment using the Biodex Balance System significantly reduces the fear of falling (FES-I score >26) among the elderly, and their knee extensor and flexor isometric strength improves as a secondary gain [17].

A recent study confirmed changes in the trunk muscle strength and body composition among elderly subjects after training using the Spine Balance 3D system. The experimental group showed a significant improvement in trunk muscle strength after analyzing the alignment of the system direction and tilt with the trunk sensors by using trunk maintenance ability as a reference for trunk muscle strength [19].",

However, the control group showed significant improvements in trunk muscle strength only under three conditions while the experimental group showed improvements in trunk muscle strength under all four tested conditions, and the experimental group showed a relatively higher improvement in the trunk muscle strength. The tests conducted using Biodex Balance System's evaluation program revealed that both the experimental and the control groups showed significant improvements in two of three conditions with similar magnitude. The experimental group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test with eyes open and closed under two conditions while the control group showed significant improvements in postural stability test under a condition with closed eyes condition and in the limit of stability test. Although each system's learning effect on outcomes cannot be neglected, the treatment effect of the experimental group who used the Spine Balance 3D system for training was confirmed to be superior to that of the control group through a comparative analysis. Compared to the Biodex Balance System, where balance training is conducted horizontally while standing perpendicular to the surface, the Spine Balance 3D system might be more effective because the trunk muscle is activated to maintain the body balance against increasing gravitational force caused by the increase in tilt angle in 3D space.",

Second, although there were no restrictions for registration, each subject was able to walk independently for 10 m or more, and their BBS scores were over 40, which means that the subjects had relatively mild conditions. Third the long-term effects of the treatment could not be confirmed. In addition, we could not exclude the learning effect for each evaluation system. Finally, the level of the trunk muscle activity could not be directly proven. Therefore, future studies need to include more subjects, and treatment methods should also be confirmed in subjects with more severe conditions. In addition, a method that can directly quantify trunk muscle strength, such as electromyography (EMG) activity, should also be attempted, and the studies should be designed to explore whether the treatment effects are still present months after the experiment.",
