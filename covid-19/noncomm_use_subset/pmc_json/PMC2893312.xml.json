Consolidation was defined as increased lung attenuation that obscured the underlying vasculature (16). The lesion size was described as small (diameter, less than 1 cm), medium (diameter, 1 to 3 cm), large (diameter, 3 cm to 50% of the segment), or segmental (50% to 100% of the segment). The sites were described by the name and number of involved segments of the lung. Location of the lesion was defined as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung; otherwise, it was defined as central (17). Attention was also paid to the presence of other abnormalities such as pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, calcification, or septal thickening.",

However, his symptoms did not improve.

Also, in four out of the five patients with small GGOs (80%), the lesions were localized in the periphery of the lung, and two of the five patients also showed bilateral involvement. For segmental involvement in terms of lesion size, three patients showed one segment, one patient showed two segments, one patient showed three segments, and one patient showed eight segments. Nodules were observed in all patients (100%), which were small in size with showing poorly defined margins (Fig. 2B). In five patients (83%), the nodules were combined with GGOs in the same area. In addition, the nodule was a solitary finding in one patient (17%), which was located in the peripheral area of the right upper lobe. The patient who progressed into ARDS had bilateral lobar consolidations combined with GGOs, nodules, and bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 3B).

Leukocyte counts are variable according to stage; frequently low during the early stages of illness, and later become normal or slightly elevated (15). In the present series, there were no patients with elevated WBC counts and 67% of patients showed lymphocytopenia. These findings are consistent with those found in previous studies that dealt with unspecified populations (3, 5). One additional diagnostic laboratory feature we were able to find was an elevated CRP level while both the ESR and WBC counts remained within a normal range in all patients in our study with pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. We believe that elevated CRP levels, combined with a lack of leukocytosis or elevated ESR, may be characteristic of patients with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, although these laboratory tests might generally not be able to render a specific diagnosis of this influenza viral infection (14).

In addition, the symptom aggravation had occurred after he had been in contact with a patient infected with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus and there were no pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus cases in the unit the patient had been enrolled in.

Thin-section CT examination results revealed that abnormal findings were found in six out of 12 patients (50%). The most common CT abnormalities included small GGOs in five out of six patients and nodules in all six patients. However, in the previous studies (12, 13), multifocal consolidations (two of seven patients and 50%) and GGOs (two of seven patients and 25%) were the most common CT findings of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection.

We attribute this to the patient population of our study. All of our patients were healthy young soldiers without any risk factors for complications. Furthermore, according to military rule, any problems concerning health must be notified to the medical department immediately, and thus, our patients may have been detected at an earlier stage of the disease course than would be found for the general population. In comparison with a previous report (3) that showed a high mortality rate in patients with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, the interval between symptom onset and the emergency department visit (mean 1.7 days in 15 among 18 patients) and symptom onset and the start of antiviral agent therapy (mean 3.9 days) were shorter. In addition, detection and treatment were made more promptly. Therefore, we conclude that an early diagnosis and early antiviral management can improve the clinical course and outcome of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. However, to understand the detailed relationship between symptom onset to admission or antiviral management and clinical courses or outcomes, further study, including a comparative analysis with a large case series, is warranted.",
