All calves had ad libitum access to\nstarter, hay and water throughout the study. Three of the calves were used twice in this\nstudy after allowing a rest interval of more than 1 week. The calves were deemed healthy\nbased on physical examination and hematologic analysis. All calves were clinically normal\nbefore the start of the experiment, as determined by vital signs, physical appearance,\nmilk intake, and urine and feces production. Dryness and coolness of the mucous membranes,\nsinking of the eyes and eyelid skin tenting of approximately 0.5 sec were the main\nclinical signs observed following the induction of diarrhea. All calves became dehydrated,\nand metabolic acidosis was induced secondary to diarrhea caused by the following\nacidification procedure. The calves were primed with cold milk, which was prepared by\nadding 400 g of commercial milk replacement powder (Mo-toku milk 02 for calf, Scientific\nFeed Laboratory Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to 3 l of cold water (below\n4\u00b0C). The milk was administered twice a day for 2 days through a feeding tube [15]. Before the start of and at the end of the\nacidification procedure, base excess (BE), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and BHBA were\nmeasured. A 14-gauge catheter (Surefrow Catheter SR-OT1464C, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was\ninserted into the right jugular vein of the conscious calves. The catheter was then\nconnected to an ordinary drip tube that controlled the flow rate. The calves were randomly\nassigned to the ISS group (n=3; IV infusion of ISS), AR group (n=3; IV infusion of AR) or\nARD group (n=3; IV infusion of ARD). The calves received 80 ml/kg of the\ndesignated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr, resulting in a flow\nrate for the dextrose of 1.0 g/kg/hr. Initiation of fluid infusion was designated as time\n0 (base). Venous blood samples were collected at base, as well as 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hr\nafter initiation of fluid therapy. Venous blood samples were anaerobically collected in a\nheparinized 1-ml syringe from the left jugular vein, and the tips of the\nsyringes were capped after collection.",

The cholera toxin of Vibrio cholera and the heat labile toxin\n(LT) of E. coli cause secretory diarrhea [8]. In a clinical study, C. parvum was isolated from 13/16\ndiarrheic calves. Following infection, clinical signs peaked at 3 to 5 days and lasted for 4\nto 17 days [6]. C. parvum damages the\nsmall intestinal villi, which results in failure of electrolyte and water absorption\n(malabsorptive diarrhea). Calves with diarrhea resulting in dehydration had increased\nD-lactate concentrations and a negative energy balance caused by anorexia and malabsorption\nof nutrients [20]. Hypoglycemia has been reported in\ndiarrheic calves, which were found to be weak, lethargic or comatose [21]. Hypoglycemia, often occurring in combination with hyperlactatemia,\nwas typically observed in the terminal stages of the disease [11]. Therefore, intravenous fluid therapy must supply sufficient sodium\nto normalize the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, provide an alkalizing agent to correct\nthe metabolic acidosis and provide energy because most calves that have diarrhea are in a\nstate of negative energy balance [5]. In this study,\nwe used an experimental model and a clinical study to evaluate whether dextrose administered\nintravenously to diarrheic calves was an effective treatment.",

These results indicate that both AR and ARD infusions are\nappropriate for the treatment of dehydrated calves. However, at the end of fluid therapy,\nthe rPV of the AR group was found to have increased significantly than that of the ARD\ngroup. It is possible that osmotic diuresis caused hyperglycemia in the ARD group. A\npossible explanation for the difference in rPV was the distribution of fluid between the\nplasma and interstitial compartments in the ARD group.

Similarly in the clinical study, BE measurements\nin 8/8 calves in the AR group and 8/8 calves in the ARD group increased during fluid\ntherapy.

Intravenous infusion of both\nISS and AR led to increased BHBA concentrations. After rehydration, the\nNa+/K+-ATPase pump and Cori cycle could be activated in calves with\ndiarrhea; both use energy in the form of ATP. Consequently, ISS and AR without dextrose did\nnot prevent exhaustion. On the contrary, in both the experimental model and the clinical\nstudy, we demonstrated that IV infusion of ARD prevented catabolism. This suggests that the\naddition of dextrose maintains glycometabolism and inhibits increases in BHBA caused by\nlipolysis. In the experimental model, ARD infusion induced a rapid and significant decrease\nin BHBA. In the clinical study, ARD infusion resulted in significant decreases in BHBA\nvalues at the end of fluid therapy. This suggests that exhaustion occurred more severely in\nthe clinical study than it did in the experimental model. Several investigators have\nreported that the addition of dextrose to fluids maintains blood glucose and inhibits\nglyconeogenesis. As a result, the breakdown of skeletal muscle and formation of ketone\nbodies in patients undergoing surgery is controlled [13, 19, 24]. Therefore, ARD containing 5% dextrose may be useful for the treatment of\nwasting diseases like diarrhea. Infection with C. parvum has been shown to\ninduce severe villous atrophy in calves [11], leading\nto malabsorptive diarrhea. Absorption is impaired due to the loss of mature villous\nepithelial cells and their associated transporters as well as a decrease in total surface\narea [7]. For prevention of catabolism and maintenance\nof adequate nutrition, the addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may be more effective\nthan the oral administration of dextrose.",
