            "text": "Recombinant adenovirus-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have been successfully introduced in several human gene therapy clinical trials because of their nonpathogenic nature, low toxicity, minimal immunogenicity, and long-term persistence. Production of large quantities of clinical grade rAAV vectors for gene therapy has been challenging due to limitations in scalability of the commonly used co-transfection protocol.1 AAVs are not able to replicate by themselves and were first found to propagate only when adenoviruses or herpes viruses coinfected the same cells.2,3 The first scalable rAAV protocol was based on adenovirus infection of rAAV/Rep-Cap cell lines.4 Besides adenoviruses, also herpesviruses have been shown to provide complete helper virus functions for the production of AAV virions.5,6 The minimal set of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) genes required for AAV replication and packaging has been identified as the HSV-1 early genes UL5, UL8, UL52, and UL29.7 These genes encode components of the HSV-1 core replication machinery\u2014the helicase, primase, and primase accessory proteins (UL5, UL8, and UL52) and the single-stranded DNA\u2013binding protein (UL29). A protocol for production of rAAV serotype 2 (rAAV2) vectors using HSV-1 amplicons expressing AAV2 Rep and Cap in combination with rHSV-1 helper vectors has been described,8 and this protocol was modified and further optimized by several groups using coinfection of two rHSV-1 vectors, both replication-deficient infected-cell protein ICP27-mutants, one carrying rAAV provirus and a second bearing AAV2 Rep-cap genes,9\u201311 The use of rHSV-1 vectors has been historically limited by their relatively low titers and the rAAV vector yields in the rHSV-based manufacturing, thus would be affected by the titers of rHSV-1 helper.12,13 Therefore, several methods to improve rHSV-1 yield have been studied, i.e., changing rHSV-1 propagation conditions12\u201314 or using anti-inflammatory compounds known to inhibit the host defense mechanism, like dexamethasone or valproic acid.15,16 In our search for compounds that would increase HSV-1 yield, we investigated another anti-inflammatory compound, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). ATA is a heterogeneous mixture of polymers accredited with a continuously growing number of biological activities.17\u201320 ATA is mostly known as an antiviral agent to several viruses like HIV, herpesvirus HHV-7, SARS-CoV, and others.20\u201323 However, ATA did not block the replication of adenovirus type 524 and has been reported to increase adenovirus type 5 titer in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells.25",

Interestingly, ATA treatment delayed HSV-1 plaque formation or cell lysis in V27 cell monolayers. Cytopathic effect at the time of harvest, 72 hours postinfection was between 20 and 60% as compared with 100% cytopathic effect in the absence of ATA (data not shown). To determine which concentrations and conditions for ATA addition have impact on HSV DNase resistant particles per milliliter (DRP/ml) and plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) titers, ATA was added at varying concentrations (0\u201360 \u00b5mol/l ATA) either in six-well plates in the first step (ATA@step1) (Figure 1b) or in T150 flasks in both steps (ATA@step1 and ATA@step2) (Figure 1c). Both protocols show HSV yield increase, and the optimal conditions would be either with 50 \u00b5mol/l ATA during the infection step (50 \u00b5mol/l ATA@step1) that is further diluted to the final concentration of 20 \u00b5mol/l ATA or by adding ATA at dilution step (20 \u00b5mol/l ATA@step2) to achieve the final concentration of 20 \u00b5mol/l ATA (Figure 1b,c). In this example, the supernatant titers were 2.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 108 DRP/ml and 8.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 107 PFU/ml in 50 \u00b5mol/l ATA@step1 protocol, 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 108 DRP/ml and 7.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u00d7 107 PFU/ml in 20 \u00b5mol/l ATA@step2 protocol, as compared with 7.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 107 DRP/ml and 2.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 107 PFU/ml of untreated control (0 \u00b5mol/l ATA) (Figure 1c).

In rHSV-1\u2013based rAAV manufacturing protocol, the yield of rAAV is limited by the maximal titer of helper rHSV-1 vectors, and in addition, the presence of residual ATA in rHSV-1 stocks did not negatively influence rAAV yield. Thus, these findings are important both for large-scale rHSV-1 vector production and rAAV vector production. Previously, several groups were investigating possibilities to increase HSV-1 titers by changing the propagation conditions or by using reagents capable of decreasing host defense.13\u201316 HSV-1 is known to both induce and partially evade host antiviral responses.26 Both dexamethasone and valproic acid have been shown to increase HSV-1 yield by either inhibition of cellular defense against viral propagation or induction of interferon (IFN)-responsive antiviral genes.15,16 ATA was reported to reduce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling, or to prevent IFN-mediated transcriptional activation.27,28 ATA has also previously been shown to increase adenovirus type 5 titer in HEK-293 cells.25",

At the time of harvest, the cell pellet was frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. DRP titers were quantified by real-time PCR in a 96-well block Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Crude samples were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing, then incubated in the presence of 250 U/ml of Benzonase Endonuclease (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in 2 mmol/l MgCl2, 1% final concentration protein grade Tween 80, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 minutes, followed by 0.25% Gibco Trypsin (Invitrogen Life Technologies) digestion at 50 \u00b0C for 60 minutes. Finally, treatment with DNase I (50 U/ml final concentration) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes was performed and then denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. Linearized plasmid pDC67/+SV40 (Genzyme, Framingham, MA) was used to generate standard curves. The primer\u2013probe set was specific for the simian virus 40 (SV40) poly (A) sequence: rAAV-F: 5\u2032- AGCAATAGCATCACAAATTTCACAA-3\u2032, rAAV-R: 5\u2032-GCAGACATGATAAGATACATTGATGAGTT-3\u2032, and rAAV-Probe: 5\u2032 6-FAM-AGCATTTTTTTCACTGCATTCTAGTTGTGGTTTGTC-TAMRA-3\u2032. Amplification of the PCR product was achieved with the following cycling parameters: 1 cycle at 50 \u00b0C for 2 minutes, 1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, and 40 cycles at 60 \u00b0C for 60 seconds. The results were expressed as a mean of rAAV DRP/ml titers \u00b1 SD and were statistically analyzed by Prism 5.0d GraphPad Software.",
