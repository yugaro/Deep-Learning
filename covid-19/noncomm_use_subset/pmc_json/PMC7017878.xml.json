These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reaction-driven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks.14",

The analysis process incorporated both deductive and inductive approaches, and followed a process of initial coding, identification of new themes, primary coding and identification and analysis of emerging themes.25 An initial codebook associated with the five core themes of the interview guide was developed a priori. After a close reading of the transcripts, two authors used the initial codebook to independently code two transcripts in their entirety, making notes on emerging themes and specified subthemes. Subsequently, the two authors adapted the codebook and used the modified codebook to code all of the transcripts. During the coding process, the two authors met when any major new themes or concepts emerged to decide on any necessary revisions to the codebook, until no new themes emerged and no new information was obtained from the coding. The final codebook was restructured with five sections: (1) demographics, (2) biosecurity in human environments, (3) human\u2013animal contact, (4) illness, treatment and death and (5) animal taxa; subthemes were defined under each section.",
