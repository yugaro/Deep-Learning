            "text": "Here, we focus on the frameshifting signal found in several viruses (1), including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and SARS-CoV. The signal leads to programmed ribosomal \u22121 frameshift, whereby multiple proteins are produced from a single polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) (4,5). The frameshift efficiency, i.e. the fraction of ribosomes, which change reading frame, is important to ensure a correct stoichiometric relationship between the different products of translation. It has been shown that altered frameshift efficiency has detrimental effects on the proliferation of HIV-I and the yeast L-A viruses (6,7). In order to induce \u22121 frameshift, these viruses rely on three physical features on the mRNA: a heptanucleotide sequence, a spacer and a downstream structure (8). The heptanucleotide sequence, called the slippery sequence, is where the \u22121 frameshift occurs and typically has the following sequence: X XXY YYZ, where X, Y and Z denote nucleotide species and spaces indicate initial reading frame. The spacer is a stretch of 6\u20139 nt positioning the ribosome correctly at the slippery site when encountering the downstream structure. The downstream structure is most often found to be a pseudoknot. The pseudoknot structure probably functions as a physical barrier deforming upon approach of the translating ribosome (9), thereby assisting the frameshifting process; however, geometry and surface charge of the structure may also play a role for the frameshifting (10).",

However, many frameshift signals deviate little from those described for the virus-derived system used here and many signals are of such general character that ribosomes from different kingdoms of life will respond to them by shifting frame (12). This happens not always with the same efficiency as in the original organism (12,13) and there are even examples found where a frameshift element can direct the ribosomes into \u22122 or +1 frameshift depending on the test organism (14). Here, we challenged E. coli ribosomes by constructing artificial frameshifting signals containing pseudoknot-like structures with strong stems. Using a refined frameshift assay, involving two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins, we show that a significant amount of frameshifted ribosomes permanently stall within the strongest pseudoknots which therefore efficiently act as roadblocks.",

The fully assembled and translating 70S or 80S ribosomes seem to be more robust. It is, however, broadly accepted that mRNA secondary structures can function as obstacles to translating ribosomes (17,18) although examples exists of large secondary structures in mRNA that are translated without any ribosomal delay (19). Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence from in vitro experiments showing that ribosomes may pause upstream to such structures, most pronounced if the structures form pseudoknots (20\u201322). Possibly the lack of rotational freedom in the helix of stem 1, due to the pairing in stem 2, makes pseudoknot structures harder to \u2018unzip\u2019 by the ribosome than simple stem\u2013loop structures (23). This may explain why pseudoknots can pause ribosomes. Examples from nature show the existence of diverse peptide sequences, often present in regulatory circuits, which will stall ribosomes (24), but to our knowledge, a permanent halt of ribosomes caused by mRNA structures has not been shown previously.",

            "text": "Recent single molecule investigations suggest that the mechanical strength of pseudoknots correlate with the ability of the pseudoknot to stimulate frameshift (25\u201327), at least in a certain interval. However, the calculated Gibbs free energy does not always correlate with frameshift efficiency. Not only the strength of the stems, but also the interaction between the loop and the stems might be of importance for the ability to induce frameshift and for the overall mechanical strength and brittleness of the structure. If the pseudoknot becomes too strong the ribosome, frameshifted or not, might not be able to open it and continue translation, whereby the pseudoknot acts as a roadblock. Often in literature (25\u201331) frameshifting assays were performed on constructs exhibiting the common feature that the stop codon for the normal reading frame was located at the entrance of the pseudoknot (or inside the pseudoknot) and the stop codon for the successful \u22121 frameshift was located downstream of the pseudoknot. In most frameshifting assays, the amount of frameshifting is determined by quantifying the amount of full-length frameshifted versus non-frameshifted products. However, for this to be a correct measure, the frameshifted ribosome must continue translation through the pseudoknot and beyond to the \u22121 frameshifted stop codon. If the \u22121 frameshifted ribosome permanently stalls inside the pseudoknot, it would falsely be interpreted as if the ribosome did not frameshift. Therefore, there is a serious pitfall in the classical methods which renders the amount of frameshifted ribosomes to be non-correctly determined, i.e. be underestimated, potentially leading to false hypotheses regarding the physical mechanism of frameshifting.",

The \u2018Upstream stop\u2019 constructs had an in-frame stop codon in the spacer between the slippery sequence and the pseudoknot. This caused non-frameshifted ribosomes to produce a 28 kDa polypeptide (gene10 from phage T7) while ribosomes undergoing a \u22121 frameshift continued through the pseudoknot and into lacZ producing a 148 kDa fusion protein of the T7 gene10 and lacZ sequences. In the \u2018Downstream Stop\u2019 constructs we replaced the UAA stop codon immediately upstream from the pseudoknot with a lysine codon (AAA). This change caused non-frameshifting ribosomes to continue through the pseudoknot and terminate at a downstream UGA codon producing a 37 kDa polypeptide. The pseudoknot constructs based on the plasmid OFX302 (25) are detailed in Figure 1B. We systematically increased the length of stem 1 and in pseudoknot 22/6a through 22/6c, we exchanged GC with UA base pairs, thus, gradually decreasing the stability of stem 1.\n",

Here, our gene10-lacZ fusion was even longer and transcription should take ~120 s. Accordingly, all induced strains included in Figure 4 show a distinct smear of mRNA fragments recognized by all three probes. In order to examine the half-life of our artificial transcripts, we made experiments where transcription from the Ptac promotor was stopped due to removal of the inducer (Figure 5).

In addition, both the pseudoknot containing constructs (10/6 and 22/6a) revealed the existence of a short mRNA fragment that was recognized only by the gene10 probe but not the lacZ5\u2032 and 3\u2032 probes (indicated by \u2018asterisks\u2019 in Figure 5). This fragment includes the transcription start in the 5\u2032-end and the pseudoknot in the 3\u2032-end. We suggest that the pseudoknot acts as an exonuclease barrier like the natural stem\u2013loop structure in the 3\u2032-end of the wild type lacZ transcript (37) and thereby induces a degradation intermediate of a distinct length with increased half life compared to unstructured mRNA sequences like those from construct 0. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, a pseudoknot acts like a rho-independent termination signal to the RNA polymerase. However, the sequences were not followed by a row of uridine residues, which would be necessary to make a stem\u2013loop structure into a functional transcription terminator.",

It is, however, likely that the loop\u2013stem interaction, surface charges or other players than just mechanical strength influence frameshift stimulating effect of mRNA structures. As there is a consensus in recent literature that pseudoknot mechanical strength correlates with frameshifting efficiency (23\u201325), it was intriguing that the amount of frameshifted product was reduced by the stronger pseudoknot 22/6a compared to the weaker 22/6b or c (Figure 3A). This proved to be caused by stalling of a significant amount of frameshifted ribosomes by the strong pseudoknots (Figure 3B).

Because ribosomes are limiting in growing cells (40), the sequestration of ribosomes by engagement in induced overexpression of a gene from a plasmid will often cause a strain to grow slower than the uninduced counterpart. The enhanced reduction in growth rate upon induction of 22/6a compared to the 0 construct (Supplementary Figure S3) could indicate that stalled ribosomes were not rescued at a sufficiently high rate and we suggest that either the ribosomal rescue systems were titrated by the large amount of mRNA induced from the plasmid alleles, or alternatively, that no rescue is possible for pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes.",

(A) All plasmid constructs contain an IPTG inducible promoter in front of T7 gene10 (light grey), a complete frameshift signal, and lacZ (dark grey). The frame shift stimulating pseudoknot-like structure is inserted downstream of gene10. Immediately, downstream from the pseudoknot lacZ is inserted in the \u22121 reading frame relative to gene10. In the \u2018Upstream Stop\u2019 construct the non-frameshifting ribosomes will translate gene10 and terminate at a UAA stop codon in the spacer sequence and produce a 28 kDa polypeptide. Ribosomes undergoing \u22121 frameshift at the slippery sequence translate lacZ thus producing ~148 kDa polypeptide. In the \u2018Downstream Stop\u2019 construct the UAA stop codon is replaced by an AAA lysine codon thus resulting in ~37 kDa polypeptide being produced by non-frameshifting ribosomes which terminate at an UGA stop codon downstream from the pseudoknot. (B) Sequence and structure of the inserted pseudoknots, the slippery sequence and the spacer. In pseudoknot, 10/6, 22/6a, 22/6b and 22/6c the first base in loop 2 has been removed in order to maintain the downstream reading frame (underlined). The boxed insert in panel B shows the structure and sequence of previously described constructs (25).",

The expected size and isoelectric point of the completed peptides for both non-frameshifting ribosomes (DS-stop) and for \u22121 frameshifted ribosomes (FS) are indicated.
