We believe that the certified care levels are a simple and useful indicator of a patients\u2019 PS. In this study, certified care level 5 was a significant risk factor for the radiographic findings. Level 5 is the highest, which is assigned to people with the worst PS, such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 4 (completely disabled, unable to carry out self\u2010care, or totally confined to bed or a chair). Esayag et al.13 prospectively evaluated bedridden patients with suspected pneumonia. They reported that positive and negative predictive values of CR for diagnosing pneumonia were 83% and 65%, respectively, and concluded that CT might provide valuable diagnostic information in bedridden patients.

Because aspiration pneumonia shadows tend to distribute to the lower and dorsal zone of the lung,13, 14 chest radiography might be unable to detect the shadow due to the dome of the diaphragm projecting over a significant portion of the lower zone of the lung. In our study, 18 of 29 patients (62.1%) showed negative findings on CRs because the pneumonic shadows were dominantly distributed over basilar lung fields. Although lateral CRs might be useful for detecting the shadows, it was difficult to take lateral views for the poor PS patients. In addition, most of the poor PS patients could undergo chest radiography in the prone or sitting position only, and they could not obey the instruction of inspiration. As a result, the diaphragm would be in a relatively higher position in CRs and cover the pneumonic shadows.",

With regard to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010associated coronavirus pneumonia, there was a study reported that CT was useful for the early diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with normal CRs.17 For pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients, there was a report that CT could detect pneumonic shadows approximately 5 days earlier than CR.9 Our subgroup analysis performed among care level 5 patients showed significantly lower mortality in the CR\u2010negative group irrespective of severity. Although it would be difficult to clarify the relationship between radiographic findings and prognosis using the retrospective survey seen in the current study, we think that CT contributes to early diagnosis, early treatment, and better prognosis for pneumonia patients with poor PS and negative CR findings. Additionally, our data showed that 31.0% of the CR\u2010negative group had an A\u2010DROP score of 3 or more.

We did not include all patients with pneumonia admitted to our hospital, and there may have been a selection bias through including only the patients who underwent chest radiography and CT on the same day. Even performed on the same day, the time lag between the chest radiography and CT may have influenced the outcome because it is conceivable that the chest radiography findings changed from negative to positive during the few hours before the CT scan was performed. A further limitation is related to radiological diagnosis ability; only part of the chest CT image was surveyed by a radiologist from another facility, and no radiologists participated in the interpretation of the CRs. To accurately evaluate the radiographic findings, all CT images and CRs should be surveyed by two or more radiologists, and the Cohen's kappa coefficient should be calculated to measure interobserver agreement regarding the interpretation of the images. However, this was logistically difficult at our hospital.",
