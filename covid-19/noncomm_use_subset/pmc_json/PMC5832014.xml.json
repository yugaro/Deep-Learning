The task force, which developed the first syllabus draft, was composed of experts representing different regions of Europe as well as representatives from each of the following organisations: UEMS (European Union of Medical Specialists), EBAP (European Board for Accreditation in Pneumology), CERS (Conference of European Respiratory Societies) and the ERS Early Career Members\u2019 Committee (ECMC) [2]. The core syllabus was the first of the consensus-based documents to be produced and published under the HERMES (Harmonised Education in Respiratory Medicine for European Specialists) initiative. Focusing on knowledge, the development of learning outcomes was the next step undertaken and was successfully fulfilled with the publication of the curriculum in 2008. Based on these documents, the ERS HERMES examination was established to standardise the certification of knowledge following the completion of national training programmes in adult respiratory medicine [3]. The ERS HERMES summer schools were established and educational resources, such as the ERS Handbook of Respiratory Medicine, were produced to provide preparatory support for the exam. Furthermore, fundamental criteria required to provide quality training in adult respiratory medicine were defined for training centres in collaboration with EBAP. The target audience was postgraduate trainees.",

Instead, it is an ongoing process \u201cwhich continues to provide important and useful information and feedback that ensures the sustainability of the curriculum\u201d [6]. Using a range of different methods, such as questionnaire surveys, focus groups, interviews and the notable Delphi method, a needs assessment has come to be recognised as a necessary and worthwhile endeavour in curriculum planning and development. Given the proven merits of the Delphi method, it was the intention of the ERS task force to employ this form of needs assessment to both inform and prioritise certain needs based upon the results of the situational analysis as well as ascertaining the specifics of what should be included within an Adult Respiratory Medicine training programme.",

The uptake of an international syllabus is fraught by local and national regulations for training, use of English as an international language versus national and regional languages [15], and how disease and approaches to medical action differ across countries [16]. The use of the 2006 European core syllabus in respiratory medicine across countries will require further investigation to assess the frequency and level of use.",

Informed by the feedback garnered from the Delphi rounds, the intention of the new, updated Adult Respiratory Medicine syllabus is to ensure that emerging fields in respiratory medicine, as well as updates in diagnosis, management and treatment practices since the initial 2006 publication, are addressed and reflected within the new publication. Comprising a simplified structure with fewer modules, the reviewed syllabus is designed to act as a guide for educational design, the planning of teaching and learning, and assessment structures as well as resource activities, supporting the ERS and other institutions using the ERS syllabus. Given the scope of this project, the needs assessment process was not without its limitations, although its merits certainly outweighed the aforementioned challenges. In reviewing and learning from past accomplishments, through carrying out a needs assessment, ERS is continuing to make strides towards a healthy future in Adult Respiratory Medicine.",
