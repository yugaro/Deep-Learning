In 2009, the pandemic H1N1 virus caused a worldwide outbreak of influenza.2 The transmission of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses to humans was first reported in 1997 in Hong Kong.3 Since then, avian influenza viruses have globally infected 620 people, 367 (60%) of whom died; the age of those affected is mostly between 18 and 50 years, and the mortality rate is far higher than for severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and other emergent infectious diseases.4 The H7N9 viruses that first emerged in Shanghai, Anhui Province, China, at the end of March 2013 had fatality rates of 20%, and the majority of patients were in critical condition.5 Given the high infectivity and fatality rates of influenza, there is an urgent need to improve the prevention and treatment of influenza, especially using drugs.",

Therefore, amantadine is not recommended routinely for the prevention and treatment of influenza. NA inhibitors, the main choice for the clinical treatment of influenza virus infections, can specifically suppress both influenza viruses A and B, but because of intensive use, viral strains resistant towards NA inhibitors have also been found (including the pandemic H1N1 virus). NA inhibitors also have potential side effects on the nervous system.9 Compared with Western medicine, Chinese herbal medicines, widely used in Chinese clinics, can regulate multiple targets for treatment and can improve the immune function, which is an advantage in relieving upper respiratory tract symptoms.10 Considering the pandemic H1N1 virus and other viruses that may occur in the future, investigating the potential use of Chinese herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of influenza is of great research value.",

Practitioners of Chinese medicine believed that the occurrence of \u2018Feng Wen\u2019 (Wind-heat) was associated with a seasonal climate, which closely resembles influenza.11 Respiratory ailments and diseases were so prevalent in ancient China that Wen Bing developed into a highly specialised branch of TCM, which can be traced back 500 years. Abnormal climate change facilitates epidemics of respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, the human body has failed to adapt, leading to brain centre adjust disorder and decreased disease resistance, and thus increased susceptibility to viral invasion, causing the prevalence of respiratory diseases. According to the traditional Wen Bing precepts, the progression of influenza-like diseases can be divided into four stages: (1) fever development; (2) nasal symptoms; (3) fever and chills; and (4) haemoptysis.12 In modern medicine, the first two of these stages may be viewed as symptoms that usually subside without treatment. The later stages represent unusual conditions, when bronchitis and late-onset pneumonia occur.13",

Additionally, good efficacy and safety and the quick relief of fever, sore throat and other symptoms, without adverse reactions, has been shown in the treatment of children with influenza A (H1N1).22 However, it is lacking the evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. In additional, previous clinical studies have focused on Western medical methods to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines, which is not suit, because of a lack of a mature TCM evaluation system. To develop CLD into a targeted drug with less side effects that can be widely used in the prevention and treatment of influenza, an in-depth study needs to be conducted.",
