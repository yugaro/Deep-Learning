BAL samples from patients with cystic fibrosis were routinely cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical Mycobacteria. Bacterial and fungal culture testing from blood, urine, and sputum was performed upon suspicion of infection. NPH and BAL samples from every FU visit, as well as additional NPH samples obtained upon suspicion of airway infection between scheduled FU visits, were analyzed by multiplex real-time PCR for detection of airway pathogens. Serum samples obtained at pretransplant evaluation were used for TTV-DNA and EBV-DNA quantification.

The choice between CSA and TAC was made based on clinical presentation. Patients previously treated with TAC and patients with cystic fibrosis were given TAC. There was also a preference for TAC if the recipient was younger. The dosage of immunosuppression was gradually lowered during FU. Further changes in immunosuppressive therapy were based on clinical presentation.

CMV-seronegative recipients were considered to have viremia if CMV-DNA was detected, whereas recipients seropositive for CMV prior to transplantation where considered to have CMV viremia only if the level was above 3.0 log10 (1000) copies/mL. To distinguish milder infections from more severe infectious events, a subgroup of events requiring initial intravenous antimicrobial (antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal) therapy were defined as severe. Acute rejection was defined as either a lung biopsy showing rejection of ISHLT grade 1A or higher [26] or, in the absence of a biopsy, physical (increased need for oxygen) and radiological findings (progressive infiltrate without signs of infection) consistent with acute rejection followed by a prompt response to high-dose (1 g/d for 3 consecutive days) corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone).",

The assay range was determined by serial dilution of plasmids with an insert of a synthesized sequence matching the TTV PCR product, and quantification was obtained from a plot of Ct values. CMV- and EBV-DNA levels were determined using a method described previously with minor modifications [27]. All primer and probe sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

There is some evidence that TTV replication is dependent on the type of induction therapy that appears to reflect changes in lymphocyte concentration; however, the duration is brief, after which the levels of TTV recover [30]. In the present study, TTV viral load was determined in serum samples, whereas plasma was used in previous studies [16, 31].

Here it was shown that the real-time PCR method was adequate as compared with the ddPCR method, which is considered a more reliable method for accurate quantification [32]. Nonetheless, real-time PCR is prone to interlaboratory differences, and utilization of ddPCR for quantification has been suggested to circumvent this problem, facilitating direct comparison of results between centers [33, 34]. Digital droplet PCR depends on partitioning of each master mix followed by end point PCR. Quantitation is determined using Poisson statistics to generate a result that is not dependent on a relation to a standard curve and should therefore exhibit lower variability between laboratories. However, the ddPCR assays still depend on amplification of a specific target sequence, and depending on the design of the primer and probe, the targeted sequence can vary. Recent work has shown that viral DNA in plasma samples is to a large extent free and not associated with viral particles and is also subjected to various degrees of degradation, influencing the results, depending on the amplicon length determined by the PCR-assay design [35]. Thus, standardization of the entire assay including primer and probe design, use of international standards, and assessment of the commutability of reference material is needed before a direct comparison of interlaboratory results can be made with absolute confidence, even with the use of ddPCR [36, 37].",

One possible caveat when determining EBV DNA load is the use of valgangciclovir for preventing reactivation or primary infection of CMV. All patients received 3 months of valgangciclovir treatment initially after LTx; there are a few studies showing that valgangciclovir treatment reduces EBV load, which may have affected the results in this study [45, 46].",

However, we found no association between either TTV- or EBV-DNA load and infectious events or acute rejections, which suggests a limited clinical applicability as biomarkers predicting short-term outcomes related to the net state of immunosuppression. Further studies are warranted to define the effect of immunomodulation on TTV and EBV replication in relation to various immunosuppressive regimens.",
