For example, a survey of clinical practices in the diagnosis and management of 17,397 children with bronchiolitis reported that 72% of them received chest radiographs6). Accordingly, there are several studies demonstrating that the majority of these chest radiographies done on children with bronchiolitis were read as negative and thus of little clinical use678910). However, there are no studies determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings in Korean children admitted with bronchiolitis. Furthermore, there are only 3 studies in the literature reporting risk factors for radiographic abnormalities among young children with bronchiolitis7910). Determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and understanding these risk factors could help clinicians reduce the number of chest X-rays and thus avoid unnecessary radiation exposure for children.",

Finally, 279 young children were included in the study (Fig. 1). Clinical factors collected at the time of admission included sex, age, the presence or absence of fever, laboratory data, and previous hospitalization for respiratory illnesses. We reviewed chest X-rays of children with previous admission due to respiratory illnesses and confirmed that their chest X-rays normalized prior to the current illness. On admission, all subjects underwent routine chest X-ray; blood samples were taken from subjects, and laboratory assessment such as complete blood count, absolute neutrophil count, total eosinophil count, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were performed.

Another study assessing 410 chest radiographs performed on children admitted with bronchiolitis through the Emergency Department suggested that 40 (9.7%) were considered abnormal7), a number similar to our finding of 9.3%. A previous study determined that young children with oxygen saturation \u226492% or a Respiratory Disease Assessment Instrument (RDAI) clinical score \u226510 of 17 points were more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings than their counterparts10). Another study found that body temperature \u226538\u2103 and oxygen saturation <94% were associated with infiltrates/atelectasis9). Finally, a recent study reported that the presence of fever was the only significant clinical predictor of radiographic abnormalities among their cohort7). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find fever or hypoxia to be a risk factor for chest abnormalities. We found that high hs-CRP levels at admission or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the current admission were clinical factors predicting pathologic radiographic findings in this cohort. This discrepancy may be ascribed to differences in characteristics of the populations such as age, seasons during which the tests were performed, or causative agents.",

It is an acute-phase serum protein in humans, and its level rises rapidly due to the cytokines released in response to infection and inflammation19). However, it has traditionally been viewed as inadequately accurate for use in the diagnosis of pneumonia, because almost all infective, autoimmune, metabolic, ischemic, and neoplastic disorders are associated with increased serum hs-CRP levels20). Nonetheless, several previous research works have corroborated the idea that it may have a diagnostic value in detecting pneumonia21) and disease severity22) in adults and in children23). Similar to previous research, we determined that a high hs-CRP level at admission is an independent clinical predictor of pathologic chest radiographic findings in this cohort of young children with bronchiolitis and has a high negative predictive value of 96.4%, indicating that if the subject's hs-CRP is less than 0.3 mg/dL at admission, the probability that the subject has a benign chest radiographic finding is high. However, it should be noted that the current practice guideline states that laboratory studies should not be obtained routinely on children with bronchiolitis24). In this regard, we speculate that hs-CRP could be used as a biomarker to help clinicians determine whether a chest X-ray should be performed only in cases where blood samples are obtained.",
