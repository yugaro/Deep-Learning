            "text": "Constructing regulatory and biochemical networks from multidimensional data is a key step in systems biology for analyzing network properties. In the present study, we developed a model-based framework for constructing networks by integrating gene expression profiles with a prior knowledge of PPI network (Step #1 in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). First, the rough PPI network containing 90 nodes and 412 edges was constructed using PPI databases (see Methods). Next, based on the rough PPI network and the H5N1 and H1N1 datasets, the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) that measured the dependence between paired nodes were applied to filter the highly noise-induced interactions. We thus obtained the refined normal and inflammatory networks induced by H5N1 and H1N1. To construct cell-specific regulatory networks and further remove the redundant (indirect) regulations in the refined networks, we then built the ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for the refined networks and used an improved conjugate gradient method (ICG) to identify the parameters in the models (see Methods). Finally, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was employed to determine whether the interactions between two proteins were significant or just false positives (see Methods). The constructed normal and inflammatory networks during H5N1 and H1N1 infection are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4. For both H5N1 and H1N1 infections, the average relative errors (AREs) of the 99% nodes are less than 0.1 and those of the 1% nodes are within the interval [0.1, 0.2] in normal networks. In inflammatory networks, AREs of all nodes are less than 0.1 (Figure 2). The results showed the accuracy and reliability of the constructed networks.",

Previous studies have shown that increased entropy is a hallmark of cancer systems2122, thus we here attempt to determine whether the network entropy can also discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network. To test this hypothesis, we proposed a definition of network entropy (see Methods). Through calculation and comparison, we found that the local entropies in the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher values than those in the normal networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections (Figure 3). The global network entropies of inflammatory networks are also higher than those of normal networks (For H5N1 infection, 8.5891 vs. 7.7276; for H1N1 infection, 8.2584 vs. 7.6487). By performing a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of inflammatory and normal networks (see Methods), we found the global network entropy of inflammatory networks is also significantly higher than that of normal networks (Bootstrap 1000 times, P-value = 0). Moreover, the number of increased differential entropies is significantly greater than that of decreased differential entropies (Supplementary Figure S5). These results indicated that the network entropy provided good discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks.",

Detailed comparisons of these two networks are displayed in Supplementary Table S1. We found that network diameter in the inflammatory networks is the same as that in the normal networks and that the average path-length in the inflammatory networks is smaller than that in normal networks. In contrast, four other metrics in the inflammatory networks were slightly larger than those in the normal networks. Furthermore, we performed a significance test for the differences in eight local metrics (degree, betweenness centrality, bottleneck centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefficients, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC) and Eccentricity (Ecc)) for describing the topological properties of networks. Supplementary Fig. S6 shows that there are not significant differences in these common network metrics between the normal and inflammatory networks. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the network entropy performs better than other topological network metrics in characterizing the inflammatory networks.",

We would expect that proteins exhibiting the increases in entropy may (1) show more disorder in protein expression, and (2) be enriched among signaling pathways that are critical to the inflammatory response. To address the first point, we calculated the variances in the protein expression levels of the two networks (Supplementary Figure S7). The results indicated that the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher variances than those in the normal networks. Therefore, we interpret the increased network entropy as increased uncertainty or variability of protein expression from the viewpoint of information theory. In other words, the disorder expression of proteins may drive the changes in entropy.",

The functional annotations analysis revealed that genes with increased entropy were significantly enriched in several biological pathways, but no enrichment of any pathways among the genes showing decreases in entropy (Table 1). Among them, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are the main pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which can trigger the intracellular signaling cascades regulating inflammatory mediators against invading pathogens25. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines, which is a powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections2627. T cells are key effectors of the adaptive immune response. T Cell Receptor (TCR) activation promotes a number of signaling cascades that ultimately determine cell fate, which is an intricately branching network28. The cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction and Chemokine signalling pathways are also well known inflammatory related pathways. Highly elevated levels of various cytokines and chemokines are the hallmarks of inflammatory response29. Therefore, the fact that entropy changes can retrieve known inflammatory signaling pathways indicates that real biological mechanisms can be extracted from the network entropy.",

The global network entropies of the random networks were calculated using datasets under normal and inflammatory conditions. We found that the free energy and the internal energy of a network have a negative correlation, but the network entropy has a positive correlation with the average degree of the network (Figure 4).

The regulatory relationships among TLR2, IL-1\u03b2, IL10 and NF\u03baB were different from those in the normal networks. After IAV infection, IL10 positively regulated NF\u03baB, NF\u03baB inhibited TLR2 and TLR2 positively regulated IL-1\u03b2. In contrast, in the normal network, IL10 inhibited NF\u03baB (which was consistent with the experimental observations that IL-10 attenuates acute lung inflammation via inhibition of the NF\u03baB activation in lung epithelial cells)37, NF\u03baB activated TLR2 and TLR2 negatively regulated IL-1\u03b2.

To verify this hypothesis, we performed the bifurcation analysis for sensitive parameters in the normal and inflammatory sub-networks. From Supplementary Fig. S12 and Table S13\u2013S15, we observed that in an inflammatory sub-network, the LR is most sensitive to the perturbations for parameters a21 (TNF\u03b1 \u2192 IL-1\u03b2), a31 (TNF\u03b1\u2013|TLR2) and a32 (IL-1\u03b2 \u2192 TLR2). However, the RR showed that the inflammatory sub-network reached the steady states during the small perturbations (Table 2). We performed bifurcation analysis for these parameters in the inflammatory sub-networks and found interesting bistability and tristability phenomena (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Figure S13). The original values of a21, a31 and a32 were 1.2849, \u22121.4331 and 2.8533 (Supplementary Table S2), respectively. These values caused the network to remain at one steady state. When the values were perturbed within 20%, the activity levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and NF\u03baB could either stay in the same branch or continually jump into another branch of steady states. In particularly, the activity level of IFN-\u03b3 could switch between three different steady states. These results showed that the inflammatory sub-networks exhibited complicated dynamical behaviors, such as the reversible bistability and tristability, which provided a good explanation for the experimental observations in variable clinical responses for infections with the H1N1 and H3N239.",

Only one protein complex, TNFSF10(tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 10)and its partner proteins HDAC4 and HDAC5, denoted as TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, was discovered to appear in both the normal and inflammatory networks at the early stage of IAV infections. More interestingly, the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex also appeared at the late stage in normal networks. However, this complex disappeared in the inflammatory networks after 7 h with H5N1 and H1N1 infections. The statistical results for this protein complex are listed in Table 3. The results suggested that dysregulation of the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex and the subsequent imbalance may be involved in inflammatory diseases.

Combining ODEs-based optimization with AIC, in this study, we constructed the normal and inflammatory networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections. We demonstrated that increased network entropy and lower free energy in the network, both of which are related to the network complexity, are significant features of an inflammatory network, but other topological metrics did not provide good discrimination between the inflammatory and normal networks. Moreover, the dynamical interactions and multistability among TLR2, IL-1\u03b2, IL10 and NF\u03baB showed the obvious differences between the normal and inflammatory networks. These important differences in inflammatory networks may likely contribute to the severity and lethality of diseases associated with the highly pathogenic influenza infection. Subsequently, we discovered a protein complex TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 in maintaining the normal cellular state. Finally, we demonstrated that the drastic reductions in the network entropy of this protein complex during an H5N1 infection after 7 h strongly correlated with those of three proteins TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB and COX-2.",

S16 and S17 and the detailed description in Supplementary Text). The protein complex (TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5), which was predicted to be important for controlling IAV-induced inflammation, has not been identified in the normal and inflammatory networks with HCV infection. Moreover, the statistical analysis did not find the strong correlations between the entropies of TNFSF10, HDAC4, HDAC5 and those of the three proteins TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB and COX-2 (Supplementary Table S22). These results clearly demonstrated that the pathogenesis of HCV diseases is quite different from that of IAV disease.",

The design and selection of effective algorithms are essential for obtaining the accurate dynamical models. We proposed DMGBDE to handle this class of complex high-dimensional challenging problems.

The PPI network can be described using the following ODEs. where  represents the activity level of protein i, bij denotes the interaction ability of the i-th interactive protein to j-th protein, L is the number of proteins interacting with protein i, di indicates the degradation effect of the protein, ki represents the basal activity level, n is the number of proteins, and m is the number of samples.The ODE model can be rewritten in the following form. We applied the cubic spline method to interpolate the microarray data to obtain data containing 49 desired samples. For convenience, we substituted the derivative values with the central difference.After defining , , and , we converted equation (2) into the following linear model. The problem of estimating parameters \u03b8iin the linear model can be transformed into the following optimization problem. where  is the experimental data, \u03b1 is a weight parameter and  is 1-norm or 2-norm, which is used to guarantee the stability and sparsity of optimal parameters. A = diag(0,\u20260,\u22121,\u22121), which provides the constraints to force the parameters di, and ki in the equations to always be nonnegative, in accordance with the biological meanings.Selection of the weight parameter \u03b1. Selection of the weight parameter \u03b1 in the optimization problem in equation (4) is very important. A large value of \u03b1 will result in a model with a large residual. In this study, we investigated the relations between the model residual and the constant \u03b1, which was displayed in Supplementary Figure S19. When the constant \u03b1 is less than 0.0001, the model residual is no longer significantly reduced. Therefore, we chose a value of \u03b1 of 0.0001.An optimization algorithm for estimating parameters in the optimization problem. We proposed an improved conjugate gradient method (ICG) to solve the optimization problem in equation (4). The main difference from the classical conjugate gradient method is that we used the function fmincon in Matlab toolbox to estimate the initialization point. The detailed procedure of the algorithm was given (Algorithm 1 in Supplementary Text).Akaike Information Criterion. To determine whether the interactions between two proteins were significant or just a false positive, we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to validate the model order (or the number of model parameters) to determine the significance of our dynamic model parameters. The AIC, which attempts to include the estimated residual variance and the model complexity in one statistic, decreases as the residual variance decreases and increases as the number p of parameters increases. As the expected residual variance decreases with increasing p for inadequate model complexities, there should be a minimum around the correct number p of network parameters. For a model with p interaction parameters to fit with data from N samples, AIC can be written as follows55. where Y indicates the protein activity in samples, and  denotes the estimated activity of the protein from the dynamic model. This is a tradeoff between the residual variance and the model order. The minimization of AIC will determine the true model order, i.e., the number of interactions in the network. After minimizing AIC, we can easily determine the significant interactions and then construct an optimized network.Average relative error. The average relative error (ARE) is defined as follows. where Ysim(ti) and Yexp(ti) are the simulation and experiment expression values of the protein at ti time point.",
