The last variant has also been identified\nin Asia, Africa and America. Due to the existence of multiple antigenic variants for CPV-2, the clinical signs can vary greathly [6].Subsequently, veterinarians have less certainty when issuing their presuntive diagnosis, and usually, some laboratory tests are required in order to\nconfirm their diagnosis; although several techniques have been developed in research laboratories, such as hemagglutination assays, immunofluorescence, ELISA, PCR,\nimmunochromatography test and cell culture (among others), actually techniques with the greatest availability within clinical laboratories in veterinary hospitals\nonly are the immunochromatography test and PCR, however, in the research about the sensitivity and specificity of these procedures, the reports are controversial.\nMoreover, in patients with varying degrees of illness severity, the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques have not been extensively studied.",

Only 20% of the studied dogs presented typical signs as commonly\ndescribed in literature. Clinical variability for this disease has been reported previously [2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 18], and some authors have discussed factors, such as age, immune status, exposure route, viral dose, virulence of strains and co-infection with\nother infectious agents as possible causes [4, 15, 18]. This complicates obtaining an accurate diagnosis of CPV-2 when veterinarians rely solely on their clinical examination. Therefore, regarding our\ninvestigation solely based on this procedure, 42.2% of dogs will have a false-negative CPV-2 diagnosis.Through dogs medical records in this study, we observed that\nveterinarians were ruling out the possibility of infection primarily because the dogs were not exhibiting the classical clinical signs described in literature, had\nbeen vaccinated against CPV-2 and/or were adults. However, most of the dogs in our study displayed atypical signs. Therefore, we believe that subclinical infections\nof CPV-2 are more common, and veterinarians, who must decide whether or not to use additional diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity, should\nseriously consider these findings.",
