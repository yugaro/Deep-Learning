            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrated that HP-PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs. Several studies have confirmed that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is restricted through down-regulation of CD4\nat the cell surface and up-regulation of the secretion of CCR5-binding chemokines (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) in M1-type macrophage [3]. PAMs are the primary cellular target for receptor-mediated\nPRRSV infection via sialoadhesin (SN), heparan sulfate (HS) and CD163 [7]. Thus, we theorized that the observed effect on PRRSV replication in M1 macrophages results from the decreased\nexpression of viral receptors on the PAM surface. Although no significant change in HS expression was found between the two polarized subtypes compared with the control, SN and CD163 expression was markedly increased with the\nexpression of SN in M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively (data not shown), thereby demonstrating that the diminished HP-PRRSV replication in M1 PAMs is not associated with viral receptor expression. In addition, the important feature\nof M1-type macrophages is that they activate host defense programs against invading pathogens, such as HIV-1, through up-regulation of several host restriction factors, e.g. APOBEC-3G and sterile alpha motif and HD domain (SAMHD)-1.\nIt has been reported that SAMHD-1 inhibits HP-PRRSV replication by interfering with the synthesis viral genome cRNA in MARC-145 cells [33]. However, when M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after\npolarization in the present study, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. To some extent, the phenotype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can be reversed in vitro and in vivo [12, 28]. Indeed, our unpublished data demonstrated that M0-/M1-type PAMs were re-polarized to the M2 type as a result of HP-PRRSV infection. These findings\nstrongly suggest that HP-PRRSV infection can modulate macrophage polarization and might be the reason why M1-type PAMs did not restrict PRRSV at 48 hr after infection.",
