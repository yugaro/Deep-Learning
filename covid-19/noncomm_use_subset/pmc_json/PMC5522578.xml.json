Initially, stewardship liaisons systematically screened all patients initiated on empiric antibiotics upon admission to 2 geriatric units using postprescription audit. Liaisons used the audit tool and a validated antibiotic prescribing guide to assist chart review. Cases were then discussed with ASP, and recommendations on regimens, dose adjustments, or additional management were conveyed to the floor teams by the stewardship liaison in real-time, using one-to-one academic detailing and feedback.",

Forty percent admitted to taking antibiotics for a viral upper respiratory infection, and 91% reported that their friends have done the same.

Two hundred twenty-two students downloaded the app over 2 years (108 downloads in 2015 and 114 downloads in 2016). Pre- and post-app, there were no significant differences in the percentage of correct responses to questions on general antibiotic use (P = .64) or principles of microbiology and testing (P = .65). An increase in correct responses from 38% to 76% was observed for questions involving antibiogram use (P = .02) (Table 2).

We did not conduct an educational needs assessment before study implementation. Interventions were designed based on our perceived educational needs extracted from daily interactions with learners. For example, we observed from >5000 stewardship pager interactions per year that 80%\u201390% of requests are for empiric antimicrobial regimens, often broad spectrum, or intended for patients with remote penicillin allergies, for whom more streamlined \u03b2-lactam regimens are more appropriate. Quasi-experimental, before and after study design, particularly when applied to small sample sizes, has several limitations, including lack of random assignment and internal validity, generalizability of results, and robustness of conclusions on the effectiveness of educational techniques [24]. However, this methodology is common to published studies in stewardship and infection prevention. Techniques described herein are best suited for adaptation at an academic medical center, because they have not been studied outside this setting. Only 1 of the interventions was designed for and implemented in a community hospital.",

In the postgraduate residency curriculum, appropriateness of antibiotic dose and duration was not assessed at 1 month due to time constraints, and an antibiotic posttest was not administered due to a wide distribution of resident rotations across multiple sites throughout the Bronx. In addition, a statistically significant improvement in syndrome-based antibiotic prescribing was not demonstrated in all categories due to insufficient sample sizes. In the ID fellows\u2019 seminar, content of the program, mix of learners, and pre- and postassessment questions varied slightly each year, which may have affected survey results. Although a majority of local ID fellows attended our AS and IPC workshop, the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in pre- and postsurvey responses. Past course attendees have not been surveyed to determine the role of AS and IPC in their current careers and their perceived preparedness after completion of the workshop. A baseline audit of patient characteristics and antibiotic prescribing on the geriatric units was not conducted before stewardship implementation, and unadjusted length of stay was obtained from 2013 hospital discharge data only. Reduced length of stay observed during the pilot was likely due to other factors in addition to ASP intervention. Fianlly, we have not yet studied the long-term impact of the curriculum as a whole or tracked individual learner progress on the path from medical student to mature clinician.",
