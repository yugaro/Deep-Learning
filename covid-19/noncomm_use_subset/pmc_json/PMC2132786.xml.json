            "text": "Our mutational analysis focused on HA2 54\u201381, the segment of HA predicted to have a high propensity to form a coiled-coil (Carr and Kim, 1993). The choice of which residues to mutate was based on several criteria (Table I). First, we chose residues that are not absolutely conserved among naturally occurring influenza viruses. We did this to lower the probability that the structure of the mutant HAs would be severely altered. Second, we excluded residues that form salt bridges in the native structure, since loss of such contacts can elevate the pH of fusion by facilitating the conformational change (Steinhauer et al., 1996). Third, one residue was chosen to represent each of three general locations within HA2 54\u201381: NH2-terminal (HA2 55), central (HA2 71), and COOH-terminal (HA2 80). The final criterion involved the location of the residue in the final coiled-coil (Bullough et al., 1994). HA2 55 and 80 lie in \u201cd\u201d positions, which are critical for coiled-coil formation (Lupas et al., 1991; Lupas, 1996). Conversely, HA2 71 lies in a \u201cb\u201d position, which is not critical for coiled-coil formation. The locations of HA2 residues 55, 71, and 80 in the native HA structure are shown in Fig. 1\nA. Their positions in the final low-pH structure are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Note that HA2 80 is in a coiled-coil in both the pH 7 (in the first turn) as well as the pH 5 structure. ",

As indicated in Table I, substitution of Ala, Gly, and Pro gave acceptable phi and psi angles at all three positions. Next we made, computationally, isomorphous substitutions of the mutant residues in HA2 54\u201381 in the native structure (Watowich et al., 1994) and calculated the internal energy of the segment as described in Materials and Methods. As listed in Table I, all of the proposed substitutions except L80P were predicted not to change the internal energy of this region significantly. Calculations for L80P indicated a significant increase in internal energy due to a predicted close approach between hydrogen atoms of the main chain and the introduced Pro.",

Since coiled-coil formation is involved in this transition (Carr and Kim, 1993; Bullough et al., 1994) and since prolines destabilize coiled-coils (O'Neil and Degrado, 1990; Lupas et al., 1991), we predicted that Pro mutations would affect the rate of fusion. If the mutations also abrogated the formation of the final fusogenic state, then the overall extent of fusion would also be compromised. We therefore predicted that Pro mutations, especially those at \u201cd\u201d positions (V55P and L80P), would inhibit the rate or extent of fusion.

Parallel cultures were treated with dMM, an inhibitor of terminal glycosylation, since recent experiments indicate that certain HA mutants acquire excess terminal carbohydrates in HA1 (Kemble et al., 1993). As seen in Fig. 2\nA, when produced in the absence of dMM, the HA0s from the mutants V55A, S71A, S71G, and S71P comigrated with wt-HA0. The HA0s from the other mutants, L80A, V55G, L80G, V55P, and L80P, ran as multiple higher molecular weight species. When grown in the presence of dMM, however, all mutant HA0s comigrated with wt-HA0. These findings suggested that specific substitutions within the region of high coiled-coil propensity (Gly and Pro substitutions at position 55 as well as Ala, Gly, and Pro substitutions at position 80) affected the initial folding of HA0 such that it was excessively glycosylated. In view of our previous analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HA (Kemble et al., 1993), the most likely explanation is that the head domains of these mutants are not packed exactly as in wt-HA, such that the N-linked carbohydrate addition sites at HA1 positions 165 and 285 are excessively glycosylated. Since dMM does not affect the biological functions of wt-HA (Kemble et al., 1994), all subsequent analyses were performed with HAs produced in the presence of dMM. ",

The latter mutants, however, were either less efficiently delivered to the cell surface or less efficiently cleaved from HA0 to HA1 and HA2. We consider the latter possibility likely since all HA0s appeared to be well expressed at the cell surface based on RBC binding and, for V55P, FACS\u00ae analysis and indirect immunofluorescence.

Given that residue 71 falls in a \u201cb\u201d position of the final coiled-coil, we reasoned that it would have, at most, a modest effect on fusion. Given that residues 55 and 80 fall in \u201cd\u201d positions, we predicted that both mutations would impair fusion. We further predicted that the double mutant (V55P/S71P) would be severely impaired for fusion. We found the following: S71P behaved like wt-HA. L80P mediated lipid and content mixing like wt-HA but appeared to be somewhat impaired in syncytia formation. V55P fused slowly and did not appear to form syncytia. V55P/S71P did not mediate fusion.",

Nonetheless, V55P/S71P behaves like wt-HA in all of its biochemical properties analyzed: trimer formation, cell surface expression, cleavage of HA0, RBC binding, reactivity with an antibody against the major antigenic site, and resistance to proteinase K at neutral pH. The only noted biochemical difference in V55P/S71P is an upward shift (\u223c0.6 U) in its pH dependence of the conformational change, a phenotype seen previously for other fusion-competent HA mutants (Steinhauer et al., 1996). The lack of fusion activity of V55P/S71P correlates well with its predicted (COILS 2 score = 1.31) and observed (see below) impairment in helix formation.",

V55P is also impaired in content mixing and syncytia formation. We hypothesize that the impairment in the rate of lipid mixing reflects a reduction in the rate or extent with which V55P undergoes the loop to helix transition of HA2 residues 55\u201376, as opposed to its noted structural differences compared with wt-HA at pH 7 (Table III). We propose this because the mutant L80P has similar alterations in pH 7 structure, yet still induces lipid (and apparently content) mixing with the same efficiency and pH dependence as wt-HA.",

White, unpublished results). To do this, we engineered the Pro mutations into their corresponding locations in an Escherichia coli expression vector that encodes HA2 residues 33 to 127 (gift of Dr. Peter Kim, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). The mutant proteins were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and analyzed by circular dichroism. Given their fusion phenotypes as full-length HA proteins (see above) and the predicted general destabilizing effect of prolines on helix formation (O'Neil and Degrado, 1990; Lupas et al., 1991; Lupas, 1996), we predicted that the order of helix-forming potential would be: wt > S71P > L80P > V55P > V55P/S71P. The predicted order based solely on the COILS 2 scores is: wt > S71P > V55P > L80P > V55P/S71P. The only difference between the two predictions is the relative rankings of V55P and L80P. The helix-forming potentials of the E. coli constructs at pH 5 were: wt = 77%, S71P = 55%, V55P = 38%, L80P = 35%, and V55P/S71P = 28%. Hence the observed order for helix forming potential (also seen at pH 7) is in good agreement with the structural predictions.",

Hence the segment containing HA2 80 in L80P likely did not have to convert from a random into a helical structure at low pH. (b) If the loop to helix transition is nucleated at the NH2-terminal end of the loop (HA2 55), then a residue at the COOH-terminal end, especially one that is already in part of an \u03b1-helical segment, may not significantly influence the transition to the low-pH form.

Diiodofluorescein affects the conformational change in X:31 HA and inhibits fusion and infection in tissue culture. The mutation would promote the formation of a salt link between HA1 E27 and HA2 R54 (the most NH2-terminal residue of the loop; see Fig. 8, C and D in Hoffman et al., 1997) and thereby stabilize the molecule (i.e., make it harder to undergo the spring-loaded conformational change). Biochemical data support this prediction (see Table I in Hoffman et al., 1997).

However, recent studies with both HA (Tatulian et al., 1995; Gray and Tamm, 1997) and with a model retrovirus (Hernandez et al., 1997) have provided clear evidence for differences in the conformational changes of viral fusion proteins at membrane surfaces. (b) Some separation of the globular head domains is required for fusion, at least with X:31 HA at 37\u00b0C (Godley et al., 1992; Kemble et al., 1992). However, it is not clear to us that the globular head domains must separate to an extent that would be readily visible in the electron microscope to elicit the loop to helix transition of HA2 55\u201376 (see Shangguan et al., 1998 for an alternate viewpoint). (c) It may be that only a few trimers, those at the fusion site (Danieli et al., 1996), adopt the spring-loaded conformational change during fusion, and that these few molecules have escaped detection in the electron microscopic (and antibody) studies. The bulk population of virion HAs may undergo the change at a later time (Weber et al., 1994; Wharton et al., 1995). In addition, we have noted a change in one of the neutral specific epitopes (N1) analyzed in the low temperature study (performed on HA; Stegmann et al., 1990) when we analyzed bromelain-released hemagglutinin (BHA) treated on ice at pH 5.0. With BHA, loss of the N1 epitope appeared to occur to the same extent and with the same time course on ice as at 37\u00b0C (Bodian, 1992).",

Additional electron microscopic, biophysical, structural, and mutational studies will be necessary to prove this hypothesis. Since we see defects with both V55P and V55P/S71P at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing, we further interpret our data in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for an early step in the fusion process. Experiments are planned to test whether it is required for HA to bind, hydrophobically, to target liposomes. Although our data support the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is necessary for fusion, it is likely that other parts of HA must move during fusion activation (White and Wilson, 1987; Steinhauer et al., 1996; Korte et al., 1997). Moreover, in our recently proposed model for HA-mediated membrane fusion, we envision that the spring-loaded conformational change functions at an early step in fusion and that subsequent changes that would generate a TBHA2-like structure drive later stages of fusion (see Figs. 5 and 6 in Hernandez et al., 1996).",

There are three trivial possibilities: The first is due to differences in the analyses performed. Whereas the prior studies have used syncytia formation or infectivity as assays for fusion, we have focused on initial membrane fusion events. The second is that in some of the prior studies, structural aberrations or deficiencies in cell surface expression of some mutant glycoproteins may not have been detected. The third is that single Pro (or other) substitutions at other positions within HA2 54\u201381 may have been more detrimental. Barring these trivial differences, a more substantive possibility is that the discrepancy reflects fundamental differences between the fusion mechanisms of the influenza HA vs. those of retro-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses.",

Whereas the conformational change in X:31 HA is irreversible (Stegmann et al., 1987; White and Wilson, 1987) and appears to be under kinetic control (Baker and Agard, 1994; Chen et al., 1995), the conformational changes of \u201cneutral-pH\u201d fusion proteins could be thermodynamically controlled and/or reversible. The cores of the Env glycoproteins of three retroviruses form trimeric coiled coils (Blacklow et al., 1995; Fass and Kim, 1995; Lu et al., 1995; Fass et al., 1996; Weissenhorn et al., 1996). Although these coiled-coils appear to have melting temperatures similar to that of the HA coiled-coil, they differ in length, pitch, helix packing, and other specific features (Bullough et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1996). Any of these differences might contribute to the apparently increased resilience of the HA coiled-coil to mutation.",

            "text": "Although we interpret our data as being consistent with the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is necessary for an early stage of fusion mediated by the influenza HA, and although related mechanisms may operate for retro-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus fusion proteins, it is unlikely that spring-loaded conformational changes activate all fusion proteins. Two well-characterized viral fusion proteins, those of Tick-borne encephalitis virus and Semliki Forest virus, either do not (Rey et al., 1995) or are not predicted (Kielian, 1995) to contain regions of high coiled-coil propensity. It will therefore be interesting to learn whether any cellular fusion proteins (Hernandez et al., 1996; Rothman, 1996) are activated by spring-loaded conformational changes. This is an intriguing question since a recently proposed model for intracellular vesicle fusion invokes coiled-coil formation between V- and T-SNAREs (Hanson et al., 1997; Weber et al., 1998).",
