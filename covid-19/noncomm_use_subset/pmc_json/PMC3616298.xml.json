There was brief reference in The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum to EU law, international conventions, international patient or professional organizations and to the prevalence of conditions in the UK in comparison to other European countries, however having knowledge of these was not an explicit learning outcome. Achievement of some competencies, such as RCPCH's awareness \u2018of child health exploitation issues including child prostitution, child labour and children in combat \u2026 and the effects of armed conflict on child health\u2019 or The Royal College of Pathologists' (RCPath's) \u2018impact on health of armed conflict, natural disasters and other social upheavals\u2019, would clearly benefit from a global perspective or international experience.

This facilitated a shared understanding of what was meant by a global health competency and arguably helped with consistency across curriculum reviews. However, reviewers without a global health interest may have reached different conclusions. Secondly, the process of assignation of a competency to a category, though guided by the agreed definitions, is ultimately a subjective decision. While in some cases several people reviewed curricula, and in the FPH curriculum review good inter-rater reliability was achieved,22 this was not possible for all curricula. To reduce inconsistency all assignations to the global health category were reviewed by JH and discussed with reviewers. As demonstrated in Table 3, the global health competencies identified were very similar across the curricula indicating that this process was fairly successful. Finally, there were some discrepancies between the curricula in terms of exactly what \u2018a competency\u2019 was. Pragmatic decisions were taken where necessary and for this reason there are a number of caveats to the total number of competencies presented for each curriculum.
