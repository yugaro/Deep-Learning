This condition causes acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells; increased mucus production; and inadequate oxygenation of tissues, which can permanently damage the respiratory structures. In high-income countries, such as the United States, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis have been estimated at 120,000 cases per year among infants,[2] and the proportion of hospitalizations have tripled between 1980 and 1996, from 5% to 16%.[3] In Spain, the incidence of bronchiolitis is estimated at 7%, and hospital admissions is estimated at 1.79% annually in children younger than 2 years.[4] However, in low/middle-income countries, the data on admissions of children with severe bronchiolitis and their outcomes are seldom up to date.",

For that reason, we analyzed the respiratory viruses implicated in severe bronchiolitis among children 2 years or younger and estimated the impact of the known risk factors associated with severity of this disease to implement better pediatric care in Emergency departments in low/middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of respiratory virus infections in children 2 years or younger and estimate their associations with established risk factors for severe viral bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department in a public hospital in Mexico.",

Although previous reports have not shown that overcrowded living conditions is associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in infants,[17,35] overcrowding is a well-known risk factor for severe bronchiolitis.[1,8,25] In addition, these associated environmental factors, that were found in our study, may reflect that our hospital primarily serves a low-income population that lacks health insurance. One earlier study reported that living in low-income conditions influences the severity of viral bronchiolitis,[30] but the presence of pets, pest infestation in the house, or farm animals did not.[17,35] However, the contribution of these environmental factors to worse outcome of viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children is well studied; thus, studies in similar populations are required to analyze these associations.",

This could be a surrogate factor linked to better socioeconomic status and better life habits, as less tobacco smoke, less crowding, or better medical assistance. However, socioeconomic status or parent's level of education was not possible to compare between patients and controls because this information was missing in the majority of the cases, being a limiting of our study. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health provides the seasonal flu vaccines to all children older than 1 year, but vaccination against RSV is not available to date. Although this protective association does not explain the decreased incidence of severe bronchiolitis among vaccinated children, it is important to note that these data reflect that the healthy control group had better health care, including vaccinations against preventable infections. Pregnancy history factors, such as adequate prenatal care and taking calcium during pregnancy, were protective factors for severe viral bronchiolitis in this study. Although a previous report did not find these factors protective,[24] studies in low-income populations should be done to more thoroughly investigate these protective associations.",
