The PRRs are activated upon binding to conserved molecular structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), to induce expression of antiviral and proinflammatory proteins.1, 2 The fact that most PAMPs are expressed only by microbes and not by host cells, allows the innate immune system to respond specifically to non-self. In addition to pathogen-specific PAMPs, DNA is a potent stimulator of antimicrobial responses.1, 3 To discriminate between DNA derived from the microbes versus the host, DNA sensors are present in the cytosol, as well as in endosomal membrane structures, that is, compartments expected to be free of host DNA.",

It is expressed in the endosomal membrane and monitors the endosomal content for unmethylated, CpG-rich DNA.4 As host DNA is mostly methylated, and hence has a low CpG content, as opposed to microbial DNA, TLR9 detects foreign DNA based both on location and chemical composition of the DNA. TLR9 signals through the adaptor protein MyD88, resulting in activation of signaling pathways eventually leading to activation of the transcription factors interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 7- and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which in turn drive transcription of type I IFN subtypes and proinflammatory cytokines2 (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Recently, attention has been drawn towards cytosolic PRRs sensing DNA. Several receptors have been proposed to be important for cytosolic DNA recognition, including absent in melanoma (AIM2), gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16) and cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)1, 2 (Table 1). Upon DNA binding, AIM2 initiates the assembly of the inflammasome, a complex that includes the adaptor protein ASC and caspase 1. The activated inflammasome cleaves the proforms of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to generate bioactive cytokines.14, 15 The PYHIN protein, IFI16 and the nucleotidyltransferase, cGAS both bind DNA, mainly independent of the DNA sequence, with exceptions as described below. Signaling through cGAS or IFI16 depends on the adaptor molecule stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, ERIS and TMEM173), which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in non-activated cells.2, 16 Upon DNA binding, cGAS undergoes a conformational change, leading to activation of the enzyme and synthesis of the second messenger cyclic GMP\u2013AMP (2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP) from ATP and GTP, which is a ligand for STING. Many bacteria, including the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes,17 also produce cyclic dinucleotides (CDN), but they contain a conventional 3\u20325\u2032 linkages. These cyclic dinucleotides activate a pro-bacterial type I IFN response in mice but not humans through a STING-dependent pathway.18, 19, 20 Importantly, the cGAS-produced 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP is a highly potent stimulator of both murine and human STING.21, 22 cGAMP binds in a pocket at the interface of the two STING protomers, resulting in translocation of STING from the ER compartment to perinuclear autophagy-like vesicles.22, 23 The translocation route of STING has been less defined, however recent results determine a translocation through the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus with the activation of downstream signaling molecules taking place at or before the ERGIC.24 TBK1 is autophosphorylated and recruited to STING, allowing the phosphorylation of STING. Interestingly, the phosphorylated residue of STING has been shown to localize in a serine cluster, which is evolutionary conserved in other adaptor molecules, including MAVS and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF). The phosphorylation of STING allows the transcription factor IRF3 to dock to the phosphorylated residue, resulting in TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 leading to dimerization, nuclear translocation and activation, eventually turning on the transcription of type I IFN genes.25, 26",

As nuclear self-DNA is bound by histones, the IFI16 affinity for longer DNA fragments could potentially represent a mechanism to discriminate between self- and non-self DNA.29 At present it is not explained how IFI16 mediates signaling, although there are papers to suggest that IFI16 and cGAS act in the same pathway.30, 31",

First, it was reported that cGAMP can diffuse to neighboring cells through gap junctions to stimulate STING-dependent type I IFN expression.45 Second, cGAMP has been shown to be packed in viral particles. Two papers by Bridgeman et al. and Gentili et al.,46, 47 detected cGAMP in Vaccinia virus and murine CMV virions as well as in lentivector-derived lentivirus particles. cGAMP-containing virus particles stimulated cGAS\u2212/\u2212 STING+/+ cell lines to produce type I IFN and the particles were further able to activate dendritic cells. At present it is not known whether cGAMP is actively packed into the viral particles as an antiviral strategy to allow early type I IFN responses in infected cells and in cells with low cGAS expression, or whether cGAMP is randomly taken up together with cytosolic material as the virus particle maturates and are released from the host cell. A third possibility is that some viruses actively incorporate cGAMP, as low levels of type I IFN might influence the infection positively. Studies of MHV68 have shown the establishment of latency to be IFN dependent and IFN was furthermore shown important for the inhibition of acute cell damages resulting from uncontrolled virus replication.48",

We previously identified a conserved herpesvirus deubiquitinase to inhibit STING-dependent DNA signaling in macrophages.49 Mechanistically, this occurred upstream of DNA release into the cytosol, thus suggesting the deubiquitinase to prevent the viral DNA to become accessible for DNA sensors (Figure 3).The infected cell protein (ICP)0 protein encoded by HSV-1 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity through the RING finger domain. The ubiquitination activity and an active proteasomal pathway was reported to be crucial for the establishment of lytic infection in HSV-1 infected cells.50, 51 Orzalli et al.35 reported ICP0 to trigger the degradation of IFI16 by the proteasome resulting in impaired sensing of HSV-1 and reduced production of IFN-stimulated genes. However, ICP0 also has functions independent of the E3 ligase activity. For instance, ICP0 was found to inhibit IRF3 in the nucleus of epithelial cells co-infected with HSV-1 and Sendai virus.52 This was due to sequestration of IRF-3 in ICP0-containing foci in the nucleus, thus resulting in a dislocation of the transcription factor away from the promoter target elements.35",

The work showed pUL83 to interact directly with the Pyrin domain of IFI16, with inhibitory effects. The Pyrin domain has been reported to be essential for cooperative assembly of IFI16 filaments on dsDNA,29 which is likely to be a requirement for IFI16-mediated DNA dependent signaling. The results on ICP0 and pUL83 underline that IFI16 takes part in sensing of herpesvirus genomes and activates a STING-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway. Despite this, there is currently no mechanistic understanding of how IFI16 mediates activation of the STING pathway.",

ORF52 is like HCMV pUL83 a tegument protein, but contrary to the nuclear localization of pUL83, ORF52 is only found in the cytosol and in perinuclear regions.58 ORF52 was reported to be a DNA-binding protein and the ability to sequester stimulatory DNA was shown to be important, but not sufficient for the KSHV-dependent inhibition of type I IFN. This observation was explained by cGAS binding to DNA occurring with higher affinity than DNA binding by ORF52. To complete the inhibition of cGAS, ORF52 is also able to bind cGAS directly.59 The ORF52 homologs of three other gammaherpesviruses, namely Epstein-Barr virus, MHV68 and Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus are also able to bind cytosolic DNA and thus inhibit the enzymatic activity of cGAS, indicating that the cGAS target is evolutionary conserved in gammaherpesviruses. An ORF52-like protein encoded by an alphaherpesvirus, with a cGAS inhibitory function has not been reported. However, it has been speculated that the tegument protein VP22 from HSV-1 binds cGAS, as VP22 and ORF52 have some three dimensional structurally homology,59, 60 but functionally evidence is still lacking.",

Thus Lau et al.70 showed that knock out of E1A and E7 increased the potential to mount type I IFN responses to dsDNA in these cell lines. LXCXE-containing proteins are expressed by different ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and potently bind the retinoblastoma protein, thus mediating cell proliferation and oncogenesis.71 Lau et al. speculated that the LXCXE motifs evolved in these viruses to inhibit STING and hence to facilitate the establishment of infection, and that the oncogenic function of the LXCXE motif may be a secondary effect.

Hence HIV-1 has evolved a defense against cytosolic detectors, relying on the cloaking of a replication intermediate by the host factors CPSF6 and CypA.",

It is thus conceivable that retroviruses have evolved different mechanisms for inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway. HIV-1 is known to target the RLR pathway via a relocalization of RIG-I to lysosomes and perinuclear compartments through a mechanism dependent on the viral protease,78 but knowledge about inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway is still insufficient. Recently, the two HIV-1 proteins Vpr and Vif were reported to target and inactivate TBK1 in dendritic- and macrophage-like cells.79 TBK1 was found to be ubiquitinated, as a normal response to TRAF3 activation, but the subsequent autophosphorylation of TBK1 was lacking due to Vpr and Vif expression. Vpr and Vif were found to interact with TBK1 and as both proteins are present in the incoming virus particle, it is possible that HIV-1 inhibits DNA receptor-dependent signaling at early time points post-viral entry.79",

Although this seems counterintuitive, published data describing different cellular mechanisms, provide a rationale for why some RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit STING. First, RIG-I has been shown to interact with STING in a manner dependent on MAVS following activation by positive ssRNA viruses, thus amplifying the IFN production.80 Second, Schoggins et al.33 found lower basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes in cGAS\u2212/\u2212 mice, and proposed that low-grade constitutive activation of this pathway sets the immunological tone in the organism. In support of this, cGAS\u2212/\u2212 mice showed higher mortality compared with wild-type mice upon infection with the positive sense ssRNA virus West Nile virus. Finally, we identified that the virus cell membrane fusion induces induction of type I IFN expression in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner.81 Using virus-like particles from HSV-1 lacking capsid and genomes as well as fusogenic cationic liposomes, we showed an induction of type I IFNs upon membrane fusion.81",

The viral protease NS2B3 was found to interact with and cleave STING N-terminally, at the sequence LRRG. The LRRG sequence is not conserved in mice, and this lack of NS2B3 recognition sequence explains partly why the murine STING is not degraded by NS2B3.
