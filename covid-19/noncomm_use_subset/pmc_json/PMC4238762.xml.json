At one year of age,\n25-50% of children have antibodies against RSV, demonstrating the high frequency of this\ninfection at a young age (Domachowske & Rosenberg\n1999). In keeping with this observation, the frequency of RSV in the youngest\nage group in our study was the highest among all ages (91.6%).
