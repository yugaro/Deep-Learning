Two different assay formats can be used: the conventional format in which peptide flows over captured antibody at different concentrations or the \u201creverse format\u201d which flows antibody over the immobilized peptide. Three anti-hCXCR5 mAb clones, 16D7, 79E7 and MAB190, were used to evaluate and compare these assay formats. As shown in Figure 1, in the conventional format, reproducible kinetics data (Table 1) were obtained. However, it did not provide sufficient resolution and sensitivity to differentiate the 3 mAb clones which is reflected in the Kon-Koff rate map shown in Figure 1a. In contrast, the reversed peptide-based assay format was able to distinguish mAb 16D7 with an almost 10-fold slower Koff-rate (Table 1), which was not revealed by the conventional format assay. The Kon-Koff rate map (Figure 1b) also indicated that this reversed peptide-based assay format displayed good reproducibility.",

            "text": "However, since antibodies are dimeric molecules, it is possible that one antibody molecule could bind to two peptides on the chip surface thereby resulting in artificially high affinity through the avidity effect. Affinity (KD) data generated by the reverse format indeed were higher than the data generated by the conventional assay format. Therefore, the higher affinity data for the same antibody, at least in part, is attributed to the avidity effect. In order to evaluate the avidity effect in more detail, different levels (5, 20, and 100 RU, equivalent to 0.78, 3.1 and 15.6 fM/mm2, respectively) of biotinylated peptides were captured on a SA chip surface and kinetics assays were performed. As shown in Figure 2a, although the overall antibody binding RUs correlated to the peptide level captured, the shape of the sensorgrams for each antibody at different peptide densities were similar. As shown in Figure 2b, at three different peptide immobilization levels, MAB190 showed similar affinity results whereas clone 16D7 was dramatically different. The highest level of peptide (100 RU) did indeed alter the overall affinity (KD), mainly due to artificial Koff (9.85 \u00d7 10\u22128, Table 2), which was outside of the Biacore accuracy range (Koff \u2265 10\u22125S\u22121).",

The purified receptor was directly captured on an NTA SPR sensor chip via Ni-mediated affinity capturing.

As shown in Figure 4a, at both receptor densities, high quality kinetics sensorgrams were generated with good reproducibility. The Kon-Koff rate map (Figure 4b) further highlighted the reproducibility of triplicate data points. Three antibody samples as well as the ligand were well-differentiated by this assay format, which was not possible using the two other peptide-based assay formats. The kinetics data shown in Table 3 further demonstrated the reliability of the assay regardless of the difference in receptor density. Therefore, this limited chemical crosslinking step generated a stable sensor chip surface with full ligand binding activity. Using this method, the stabilized chip surface was regenerated with 50 mM HCl for up to 2000 repeated cycles without any noticeable loss of binding activity.",

As shown in Figure 5, CD52 virus-like particles (VLPs) were prepared from 293FT cells. After Western blot analysis to verify the presence of CD52 in the VLP prep, VLPs containing CD52 were captured by the anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab26 on a C1 chip surface. The captured VLPs were then stabilized by the same approach. Three different anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies with slightly different binding epitopes (Chu, et al., 2014, unpublished data), including the capturing antibody Alemtuzumab, demonstrated good binding activity in kinetic assays. Similar to Ni-affinity capturing of the purified hCXCR5, the capture of CD52 VLPs by Alemtuzumab is target specific. The post capture cross-linking step stabilizes CD52 in the VLP surface and enables multiple kinetic binding assay cycles to be performed.",

Alternatively, an anti-6xHis antibody can be first immobilized on a CM5 chip, and then similar levels of the receptor protein are captured indirectly on the chip surface. If necessary, more receptor can be captured to meet specific requirements, such as small molecule compound binding assays. In both cases, receptor molecules are captured specifically via the 6xHis-tag. The subsequent limited cross-linking step further stabilizes the captured receptor molecules. Therefore, it is essential that the starting material, purified GPCR protein, is tested for activity by ligand binding. The purification methods used here, adapted from Jaakola V. et al. for determining the crystal structure of the human A2A adenosine receptor in complex with a high-affinity subtype-selective antagonist16, yield active pure GPCRs without the need to engineer stabilized receptors which require a substantial amount of effort15.",

A 10-fold dilution of the standard amine-coupling reagent from GE (200 \u03bc\u039c NHS/50 \u03bcM EDC) gave the best results. Over cross-linking with 200 \u03bc\u039c NHS/50 \u03bcM EDC resulted in significant loss of binding activity (data not shown). We also tested five other cross-linking reagents for receptor stabilization on both NTA and CM5 chip surfaces. In each case, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Therefore, we chose the 20 \u03bc\u039c NHS/5 \u03bcM EDC as our standard stabilization reagent. The receptor surface stabilized by this simple cross-linking step yielded sufficient binding capacity for analyzing both antibody and ligand binding. More importantly, the limited cross-linking step kept the hCXCR5 whole receptor surface stable. The surface was not only resistant to the surfactant (0.05% Tween-20) present in the running buffer, but also allows for low pH (pH 1.5) regeneration steps. These features enabled the binding assay to be performed with the same conditions used for soluble proteins, which resulted in high quality kinetics sensorgrams and excellent reproducibility (CV<25%). This assay has been applied successfully to eight different GPCR targets (data not shown) and is expected to be applicable to most, if not all, GPCR molecules.",

Although Alemtuzumab is capable of binding to naked synthetic CD52 peptide, other anti-CD52 mAb clones require glycan as part of their binding target and the synthetic peptide method with these mAbs is not a viable option. The virus-like particles were captured by Alemtuzumab and further stabilized by limited cross-linking and this stabilized surface worked well in binding kinetics assays for comparing all types of antibodies, including the capturing antibody. VLPs produced by recombinant expression systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been reported at 30\u201350 nM in size28. We also determined that the CD52 VLPs produced in HEK293FT cells were similar in size (30\u201350 nM, data not shown). It is presumed that only a portion of the CD52 molecules displayed on VLP surface is bound by the capturing antibody; those unoccupied CD52 molecules are therefore available for binding by the analyte antibodies.

Extensive washing of the isolated raw membranes was performed by repeated centrifugation (typically six to nine times) in a high-osmotic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), followed by Dounce homogenization to resuspend the membranes in fresh wash buffer thereby separating soluble and membrane-associated proteins from integral transmembrane proteins. Highly purified membranes were solubilized by incubation in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) (Sigma) and 0.01% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) (Sigma) for two to three hours at 4\u00b0C. After solubilization, the unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 \u00d7 g for 45 minutes. The supernatant was separated, supplemented with 25 mM buffered imidazole and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) overnight at 4\u00b0C; typically, 1.5 ml of resin per one liter of original culture volume was used. After binding, the resin was washed with ten column volumes of 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 800 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 55 mM imidazole, 0.05% (w/v) DDM and 0.001% (w/v) CHS. The receptor was eluted with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 800 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, and 200 mM imidazole. The eluted receptor was directly added to anti-HPC4 mAb coupled affinity resin in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 overnight, washed 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, 1 mM CaCls and eluted with 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, 1 mM EDTA. The eluted receptor was buffer exchanged to 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",
