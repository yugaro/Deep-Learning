As well as fever, nasal discharge and sneezing can also be observed in animals infected with influenza viruses21. Although the genetic evolution of H1N1 viruses between 1918 and 2008 has been studied9, the clinical features of these viruses have not been previously investigated and compared including the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus.

Following infection, ferrets were monitored for body temperature, weight, inactivity level, sneezing and nasal discharge from each group were observed daily until Day 14 post-infection (pI). Infection by all strains produced an increase in temperature; the normal range for ferret temperature is indicated by the shaded area of each graph23 (Supplementary Fig. S1a). The pandemic H1N1 strain NY/09 induced the greatest fever on Day 2 to a temperature of 104% (of baseline). NCal/99 and Marton/43 infection also caused a high temperature of 103% from baseline, which peaked on Day 1 and Day 2 pI, respectively (Table 1).

FM/47 and USSR/77 antisera recognized its respective virus and each other (Fig. 2b and c). Taiwan/86 and 2009 H1N1pdm (NY/09 or Cal/09) antisera both only reacted with their respective viruses (Fig. 2d and h). NCal/99 antisera only showed HI with its own NCal/99 virus (Fig. 2e). Unexpectedly, the SI/06 and Bris/07 antisera were able to inhibit the NCal/99 virus (Fig. 2f and g). Furthermore, SI/06 antisera also cross-reacted with the Bris/07 virus and the Bris/07 antisera recognized the SI/06 virus. Taken together, these results showed antigenic cross-reactivity to infection among historical and contemporary H1N1 influenza strains. This data suggested similarities of the host immune response between Marton/43 and PR/34, FM/47 and USSR/77, and NCal/99 with both SI/06 and Bris/07 but despairing responses in infection with Taiwan/86 and Cal/09.",

The temporal structure of phylogenetic tree was comprised of 3 groups separated by long braches (Fig. 3a). The 1918 pandemic strains and 2009 pandemic isolates each formed their own distinct cluster. The middle cluster contained 10 epidemic isolates. Within this cluster, FM/47 was closer to USSR/77 than Marton/43 which was more similar to PR/34. The 3 latest strains of seasonal H1N1, NCal/99, SI/06 and Bris/07, were positioned as a clade which was separated from the early stains by a long branch and clustal alignment of these three viruses (Supplementary Fig. S2) showed several amino acid changes from NCal/99 and conserved between SI/06 and Bris/07: A3V, T99K, Y111H, K157E, V182A, R224K, W268R, T283N, and N489D. We calculated the protein homology by using the most variable region of the HA gene (HA135-295) which covers most of the viral surface and sequence change in this area has a strong impact in immunogenicity36. We found that 94% and higher homology scores led to HI cross-reactivity in all the cases. On the other hand, cross-reactivity with lower homologies of 91-93% may or may not take place (Fig. 3b). Taken together, our results suggested an important relationship and cross-reactivity between FM/47 and USSR/77 as well as the NCal/99, SI/06 and Bris/07 group that can be related to the genetic HA sequence. Further analysis of other influenza genes may also be important to the understanding of H1N1 evolution.",

We also found significant cross-reactivity between viruses with similar HA aa sequences which can be extrapolated to protection or no protection following a subsequent infection with another H1N1 strain. These results are the first to compare the clinical signs and the antigenic relatedness of systematic infection of this panel of evolutionary important H1N1 viruses in a single study.

These records support our findings, where animals infected with FM/47 had the lowest percent nasal discharge, mildest fever and was the only virus infection which did not lead to weight loss. Furthermore, USSR/77 infection produced a moderate disease comparable to the reports of a mild clinical disease37. Our analysis of the clinical course of Taiwan/86 infection in ferrets showed a moderate disease consisting of a mild biphasic temperature increase and minimal weight loss. These observations were in agreement with clinical disease reported during the 1986 naval base outbreak of influenza which there was no deaths but patients described fever, non-productive cough, sore throat and myalgia38. Furthermore, in accordance with our NY/09 data which had the most significant temperature fluctuations and weight loss, analysis by Shrestha and colleagues demonstrated that H1N1pdm was more severe than the previous circulating seasonal influenza viruses39.",

Furthermore, they showed that the HA1 region of the 1947 HA was significantly different from the HA of the earlier 1940's strains9. In accordance with this analysis, our results showed that the FM/47 antisera did not inhibit hemagglutination with the earlier PR/34 and Marton/43 viruses and the Marton/43 antisera did not cross-react with the FM/47 virus. The inability for immunity induced by Marton/43 virus infection to target the FM/47 virus compliments the influenza vaccine performance in the human population of the 1940's as well as previously published studies41. Specifically, a related 1943 H1N1 virus strain (A/weiss/43), as well as A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 were used in the influenza vaccine preparation which was completely ineffective during the '47 influenza outbreak1441. Although FM/47 antisera did not recognize the earlier H1N1 strains, it did cross-react with the HA molecule of the USSR/77 virus as did the USSR/77 antisera with the FM/47 virus. In support of these findings, the 1977 epidemic was thought to be the resurfacing of the FM/47 strain9. The USSR/77 outbreak was known as \u2018The Children's Pandemic' since only persons younger than 26 years old were affected14. During this time, older individuals were considered primed for the 1977 outbreak strain by previous infections from the 40's and 50's37 which is supported by our immunological evidence. Together, our results, the phylogenetic analysis and the epidemiological records suggest the triggering of a unique immune response following infection with Marton/43 and FM/47 and a similar response from infection with the related strains FM/47 and USSR/77.",

Taiwan/86 was isolated from this outbreak and genomic analysis of its HA have suggested that the Taiwan/86 virus had evolved from viruses circulating in the early 1980\u2018s in Hong Kong45. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this virus was the product of a reassortment event that had occurred between two H1N1 viruses9. Our results showed that the Taiwan/86 strain shared lower homology to 99, 06 and 07 viruses seen on our phylogenetic tree. The immunogenic findings showed antisera produced from ferret infection with Taiwan/86 was not able to inhibit hemagglutination with the other viruses on our virus panel, which compliments the literature describing the 1986 strain. The influenza vaccine in 1986 included the A/Chile/1/83 influenza strain38. Interestingly, during the 1986 US Naval Base outbreak, the soldiers who were vaccinated were poorly protected from infection with Taiwan/198638. Furthermore, it was also shown that antibodies produced by vaccination with the A/Chile/1/83 vaccine preparation were not able to provide hemagglutination inhibition toward the newly arisen Taiwan/86 and Taiwan/86-like viruses44. From this evidence, it was then recommended that the Taiwan/86 strain be included in the subsequent influenza monovalent vaccine preparation4244. Our findings together with the previous reports on the Taiwan/86 outbreak suggest that the 1986 viruses were an antigenically unique group of strains that induced a specific immune response important when considering the evolution of H1N1 immunity.",

Our genetic analysis showed the three contemporary H1N1 seasonal viruses, NCal/99, Bris/07 and SI/06, to be proximal to each other on the phylogenetic tree with a long separation from the previous Taiwan/86 virus and in a distinct cluster from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses. Moreover, Bris/07 and SI/06 were closer to each other than they were to NCal/99. Interestingly, the antisera generated by infection with NCal/99 did not cross-react with the other two contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses although the SI/06 and Bris/07 antisera recognized the NCal/09 virus. These results suggested there to be an amino acid change in Bris/07 and SI/06 from NCal/99 that may have resulted in a new antigenic site that was not originally present in NCal/99 strain. To investigate this contention we generated a clustal alignment of these viruses which showed numerous amino acid changes between Bris/07 and SI/06 sequences with NCal/99. These results may indicate the gradual yet still present drift of the H1N1 virus in this time period. As well, the immunogenic evolution seen in our analysis may question the consistent usage of the NCal/99 virus in influenza vaccine preparations from 2000\u20132001 to 2006\u20132007 947.",

            "text": "The most significant emergent in H1N1 history since 1918 ensued in late spring 2009 and was declared a pandemic shortly after15. The HA from newly emerged H1N1 virus was identified to be similar to the HA of viruses isolated from North American swine which had recent and historical precedence48. This virus was designated 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) and was shown to be a triple reassortant virus containing genes from swine, human and avian influenza A viruses16. In our phylogenetic analysis it was clearly evident that the triple reassortant viruses clustered far from the previously circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses in agreement with similar alignments. Furthermore, HI assays performed using ferret antisera produced raised against the NY/09 H1N1pdm antisera was not able to recognize the HA of any other viruses. These results are supported by previous published findings that determined the cross-protection initiated following infection with H1N1pdm which was preceded by infection with contemporary seasonal H1N1 did not occur through an HA targeted antibody response20. Interestingly, although an H1N1 component had been included in the seasonal influenza vaccine preparations since 1977 49, antigen directed pre-existing immunity to 2009 H1N1pdm was only detected in the elderly suggesting the majority of the current human population was na\u00efve to the this novel virus5051. Cross-reactive antibodies found in the elderly population suggested that protective immunity was induced from exposure to an older H1N1 virus with antigenic similarities to 2009 H1N1pdm25505152. Our study directly tested the ability of infection with older H1N1 strains from the years 1943 to 1947 to bind the HA molecule of the 2009 H1N1pdm virus. Against current hypotheses, we found that the immune production of antisera from infection with viruses originating from the 1940's were not able to recognize the HA of the novel pandemic viruses. Likewise, the H1N1pdm antisera did not detect the panel of viruses ranging from 1934 to 2007. Recently, the effect of priming ferrets with historical H1N1 viruses on the immune response of secondary infection the H1N1pdm was described5354. These studies addressed distinct immunological questions as our study utilizing a different set of H1N1 viruses. These priming studies complimented our study as the historical H1N1 strains used were not the same as ours. The purpose of the previous studies was to determine protection from priming infection/infections whereas we queried immune detection, cross-reactivity and clinical analysis. Importantly, a significant issue that remains is the affect of age on the outcome of infection/sequential infection with the historical and contemporary viruses. Historical accounts mention clinical pathology among age groups but do not have a comprehensive analysis of the comparative severity14384955. As well, it is not know how the aging immune system responds to the evolving influenza virus. Although a protective response was seen in priming studies in adult animals, it is not know if protection of the same magnitude would remain during age related immunosenescence or if the clinical response in the aged would be similar as we have shown in this study.",

These evolutionary behaviours are divergent leading to a dynamic and ever changing influenza climate in the human population where one Influenza A subtype typically dominates over the other. Importantly, understanding the interplay between the H1N1 and H3N2 infection evolution remains a significant hurdle in influenza reasearch89. Nelson and colleagues investigated the genetic evolution of the H1N1 virus by analyzing the evolution of the whole virus as well as the individual viral segments from strains since 1918 9. In this study the authors were able to identify instances where divergent clades co-circulated as well as events of intra-H1N1 subtype reassortment9. Previously, Smith and colleagues compared the antigenic and genetic evolution of the H3N2 virus from strains originating in 1968 to 2003 and found that antigenic and genetic evolution showed differing patterns8. Antigenic evolution was punctuated where the strains formed clusters and genetic change was more even and gradual as time increased8. Here we sought to elucidate the antigenic evolution of the H1N1 virus. As with the H3N2 virus8, we found the antigenic change did not vary evenly by year but instead corresponded to genetic changes in the HA molecule. These studies are significant for elucidating the intricacies of influenza evolution as the continuous change of the influenza virus is the greatest challenge to the management of disease and containment of further outbreaks. A better understanding of the evolution of the influenza virus and the interplay between the H3N2 and H1N1 strains will improve the design of prophylactics such as by guiding vaccine strain selection for yearly trivalent influenza vaccine or may even give insight to the development of a universal influenza vaccine. More work is needed to understand the true nature of influenza virus dynamics and evolution.",

            "text": "Animal models remain the most appropriate mode for the methodical scientific investigation of human influenza virus pathogenesis and the testing of influenza prophylactics and therapeutics. Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously2124263056. As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling2457. Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically \u2018Specific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely na\u00efve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin58, has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift35, the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",

As many questions still exist in relation to evolution and emergence of influenza strains, we analyzed the immunological evolution of past and contemporary influenza viruses. Our results shed light on the cross-protective immune response toward the HA molecule and suggest that unique immunity is induced dependent on the HA sequence. Further work is needed to determine the evolutionary placement of the 1918 and 1934 virus immunogenicity, as well as the placement of newly emerging influenza strains. Our results describing the antigenic evolution of the H1N1 influenza subtype together with previous work will add to the understanding of the transcendence of influenza viruses and have implications on the design of future influenza vaccines.",

Briefly, male ferrets 4\u20136 months old were bred in an on-site SPF ferret colony (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada). Prior to infection, all ferrets were screened for influenza and shown to be seronegative by HI assay against circulating influenza A and B strains (2010-2011 WHO Influenza Reagent Kit for Identification of Influenza Isolates (WHO collaborating center for surveillance, epidemiology and control for influenza infection division)). The kits contain the circulating influenza strains for the particular year. Prior to infection, ferrets were randomly selected and pair-housed in cages contained in bioclean portable laminar-flow clean-room enclosures (Lab Products, Seaford, DE) in the BSL-2 animal holding area. Baseline body temperature and weight were measured on Day 0 for each animal. Temperatures were measured by using a subcutaneous implantable temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE). Upon infection, ferrets were anesthetized and infected 1mL of virus preparation for each ferret (0.5mL in each nostril). Ferrets were infected with Marton/43 (N = 12), FM/47 (N = 10), USSR/77 (N = 12), Taiwan/86 (N = 10), NCal/99 (N = 14), and NY/09 (N = 12). All viruses were used at 105 EID50 except for FM/47 which was infected at 106 EID50 since it was reported to be a milder virus14. Clinical signs (body temperature, body weight, level of activity, nasal discharge, and sneezing) were observed daily for 14 days pI. We examined animals at the same time each day for consistency. Nasal discharge includes crusty nose, mucous, and transparent exudates/fluids. The scores were calculated from the total animals displaying any nasal discharge symptom over the total number of animals. The sneezing scores were calculated from the total animals found sneezing over the total number of animals. Scores were calculated daily for 14 days and only the peak values for each infection are summarized. The inactivity scoring system is based on the reference Reuman et al., 1989 59 to assess the inactivity level: 0, alert and playful; 0.5, alert but playful only when stimulated; 1, alert but not playful when stimulated; 2, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index was calculated as follows: \u03a3(day 1 to day 14)[score+1]n/\u03a3(day 1 to day 14)n, where n equals the total number of observations. A value of 1 was added to each observation unit score so that a score of 0 could be divided by a denominator, resulting in an index value of 1.0 as the minimum value.",
