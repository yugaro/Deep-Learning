            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea in 2015 has drawn public attention and inspired political debate regarding the regulation of infectious disease control in Korea. The discussion of the appropriateness of the regulatory system must take into account the interpretation arguments of and the legislative concerns regarding the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act (hereafter, \u2018Infectious Disease Prevention Act\u2019), its ordinance and enforcement regulations as well as public statements from the relevant administrative agency. The Infectious Disease Prevention Act of 2015 has been much improved through two successions of amendments; through the amendments, there has been great progress in the regulation of quarantine measures in infectious disease control. The initial amendments on July 6, 2015 give the government the legal authority to immediately and actively order medical institutions to follow property quarantine measures when the infectious disease enters the epidemic phase. Following the amendments in December 29, 2015, financial compensation for losses incurred due to property quarantine enforcement has been established for the high effectiveness of the authority of the measures.",

            "text": "According to the current Infectious Disease Prevention Act, quarantine measures can be classified into five types of personal quarantine and two types of property quarantine measures. The first type of personal quarantine measure, usually called isolation, involves forcing hospitalization of \u2018infected patients and others\u2019 who have an infectious disease with \u2018high risk of transmission\u2019 as declared by the government minister in authority over the matter at an infectious disease control institution or an alternative medical facility when there is a shortage of facilities for infectious disease control. \u2018Infected patients and others\u2019 includes \u2018infected patients,\u2019 who have been confirmed to show symptoms of the pathogen of the infectious disease that has invaded the body, \u2018suspected patients,\u2019 who are suspected of having the pathogen of the infectious disease in the body but are not yet confirmed to be infected patients, and \u2018pathogen carriers,\u2019 who show no clinical symptoms but have the pathogen of the infectious disease.",

The third type of personal quarantine measure involves legislation or the minister in authority officially notifying \u2018infected patients and others\u2019 with infectious diseases encompassing an even narrower range than the above two types, and forcing entrance to sites acknowledged as containing such individuals, and ordering treatment and hospitalization of these individuals after their investigation and examination. In this case, the authority to enact this measure by force through mobilization of the police force against anyone who resists investigation was added by the amendment on December 29, 2015.",

The last type of personal quarantine is a preventive measure, which forces hospitalization or quarantine of individuals \u2018suspected\u2019 of being infected with pathogens of any infectious disease, regardless of the type of infectious disease, in an appropriate environment for a certain period of time.",

The specific methods of this measure are (1) \u201ctemporary shutdown\u201d of the site in question, (2) \u201cforbidding entry by the general public\u201d of the site, (3) \u201crestriction of passage within the site in question\u201d, and (4) \u201cother measures required for blocking passage.\u201d Prior to the amendments on July 6, 2015, only measures that \u201cblock passage of the site in question for a certain period of time\u201d were allowed and therefore, the government had no legal authority to immediately and actively take measures for the shutdown of the entire medical institution or the wards with infected patients.",

If the site in question is a medical institution, method (1) involves shutdown of the entire site and method (3) involves partial shutdown. Method (2) should be applied regardless of whether complete or partial shutdown. In the case of respiratory syndromes, measures that enforce shutdown of areas within a certain distance from the medical institution in question are also allowed according to measures of (4). The second type of property quarantine measure blocks passage of the entire region or part of the region regulated by the minister in authority or by local government leaders regardless of the type of infectious disease or of its prevalence for its prevention.",

Consequently, recent amendments have established new regulations that require the government to compensate the institutions for the loss. Nevertheless, two additional amendments to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act are required to achieve greater effectiveness of infectious disease control. First, a compensation system for the sacrifice of private interests for the public interest must be developed. The compensation fund must be consolidated as a national subsidy, and the enforcement of the corresponding measure must also be consolidated under the authority of the central government, at least for the property quarantine measures. That is, in the comparison of the value of the two rights, which are the protection of the citizen\u2019s individual rights and interests and the protection of the community, if the latter has superior ends, then it is subject to the regulation of infectious disease. The inevitable infringement on individual rights must therefore be approached in terms of national economic interests.",

In order to achieve effectiveness of the quarantine measures for infectious disease control, official compensation as well as strict regulations for enforcement of the measures is required; however, currently, excluding the third type of personal quarantine measure, there are no such regulations other than ex post facto sanctions (criminal punishment in the form of a fine) under the Infectious Disease Prevention Act or ex post facto imposition of responsibility for compensation for damages under general rule of tort law. Excluding the second type of property quarantine measure, regulations through which the authorities can request police mobilization as a preliminary method of enforcing action must be established. Such methods for enactment are necessary for elevation of the effectiveness of the quarantine measures.",

The fact that infectious disease control is a government activity must not be overlooked, and private medical personnel as well as medical institutions are subsidiary institutions assisting in related affairs. Furthermore, in order to effectively control the spread of infectious disease through prompt quarantine measures, an exceptional system of direct reporting to the final decision maker must be established, as well as an exceptional system of immediate reporting and decision-making for immediate decisions on compensation in cases where a high level of compensation is expected. Meanwhile, whether the regulations associated with the detection of patients diagnosed with the infectious disease are appropriate, and especially whether the management and procedure of notification and reporting as a process of the quarantine measures is appropriate, remains in question. Detailed regulations are still needed regarding the two patient quarantine methods, which include isolation in external facilities (medical institutions, quarantine centers, etc.) and self-isolation in the patient\u2019s home.",
