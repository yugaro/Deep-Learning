The significantly reduced promoter activity in ScN2a58 cells increased after continuous treatment with Congo red (CR, 10 \u03bcM) or pentosan polysulfate (PPS, 20 \u03bcg/ml), which are both known as anti-prion drugs12 (Fig. 2c; CR: 3.8-fold and PPS: 3.4-fold).

The activities of pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced compared with the original promoter activities in N2a and 3T3 cells (Fig. 3c and 3d). The activities of pGL3 -1000/-1 (M1) and pGL3 -523/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. S3). We obtained similar results in the second mutated plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 (M2) where activity was also significantly reduced in N2a and 3T3 cells (Fig. 3e and 3f). These results indicate that the Oct-1 site might play a crucial role for murine IRF-3 promoter activity. We next determined whether the E2F1 site was important for the promoter activity. The original plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 and the E2F1 site mutated plasmid (M3: Fig. 3g) were transiently transfected into N2a and 3T3 cells.

Since two different mutations in the AML1 site (M4 and M5: shown in Supplementary Fig. S4a) had little effect on the promoter activity in N2a58 cells (N2a cells overexpress wild-type prion protein), indicating the AML1 is not also important (Supplementary Fig. S4b).",

These data suggest that endogenous Oct-1 binds to the promoter region in vivo. Furthermore, to investigate whether the promoter activity is affected by Oct-1, pcDNA Oct-1-HA and pGL3 -119/-1 were co-transfected into N2a cells. Ectopically Oct-1 overexpression significantly increased the original promoter activities (pGL3 -119/-1 + mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 + pcDNA Oct-1-HA), while Oct-1 expression had no effect on the mutated promoter activities [pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) + mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) + pcDNA Oct-1-HA], indicating exogenous Oct-1 functions in the promoter region (Fig. 4b).",

Similarly, we also analyzed the expression levels of Oct-1 proteins in prion-infected mice brains. We intracerebrally inoculated 22L or FK-1 prion strains into ddY mice and analyzed the levels of Oct-1 protein in their brains after becoming terminal, respectively. Of note, the levels of Oct-1 protein in the two distinct prion strains-infected mouse brains significantly decreased, suggesting that prion infection might repress endogenous Oct-1 expression (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S6c).

Although the E2F1 site was also present in the murine promoter, the E2F1 site mutation had little effect on promoter activity (Fig. 3h and 3i). Mach et al. have shown that Oct-1 also bound to the human IRF-3 promoter14. Importantly, the putative transcription factor binding sites in 5\u2032 flanking region are very similar between human and murine IRF-3 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, the contribution of Oct-1 in human IRF-3 promoter remains controversial and elusive. In our experimental study, mutations in the Oct-1 binding site lost their promoter activity (Fig. 3c to 3f) and exogenous Oct-1 enhanced the activity (Fig. 4b). In conclusion, Oct-1 positively regulates the IRF-3 promoter activity, while E2F1 and AML1 are not involved in murine IRF-3 gene regulation.",

            "text": "Intriguingly, Oct-1 expression was significantly reduced in two distinct prion strains-infected cells and mice brains (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Although we are not able to exclude yet the possibility that the accumulation of abnormal prion protein may directly impair the function of Oct-1, prion infection might alter the expression of Oct-1 as a result of its destructive effect on protein synthesis in the host cell. It has recently been reported that prion infection could impair the host's ability to synthesize protein by means of inhibition of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-dependent eIF-2\u03b1 phosphorylation1516. Another study revealed that the global alteration of gene expression has occurred in prion-infected mouse brains by unknown mechanisms17.",
