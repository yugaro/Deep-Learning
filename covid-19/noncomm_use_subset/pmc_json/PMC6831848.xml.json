In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) publish surveillance statistics regarding the rate and occurrence of disease for a number of human viruses, and annual summaries of these surveillance statistics are published in various forms. The Summary of Notifiable Diseases (SoND) is an annual report containing information on those diseases for which \u201cregular, frequent, and timely information regarding individual cases is considered necessary for the prevention and control of the disease or condition\u201d, a list of which is updated regularly. The CDC also maintains the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS), which includes information on the number of disease cases and outbreaks for a number of infectious agents, including certain viruses. Influenza statistics, meanwhile, are reported most frequently by the CDC via published FluView Weekly Influenza Surveillance Reports, documenting the number of cases of influenza and influenza-like illnesses in the United States. In assessing national viral disease burden, it is necessary to analyze data from all of these sources.",

Each of the six viruses exhibit different times of year in which disease cases are more prevalent. Insect-transmitted viruses such as West Nile virus are more common in the warmer months from July to September. Meanwhile, the waterborne viruses (norovirus, sapovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis A virus) all exhibit different trends. Perhaps most notable is the distinction between norovirus, which is most common in the winter from January to March, and sapovirus, which is most common in autumn from September to November. Norovirus and sapovirus are closely related, both being members of the Caliciviridae family, yet they have strikingly different seasonal infection trends. Hepatitis A virus, on the other hand, does not show significant variation throughout the year. Rather, rates of infection are relatively constant from one month to the next.",

Fig. 2 presents heatmaps of disease cases relative to state population for the six viruses mentioned above. West Nile virus appears to be more prevalent in the plains states of the central United States, while norovirus is most common in the Midwest and New England. Moreover, there is no significant spatial differentiation for hepatitis A virus from one region to another, mimicking its temporal trends. Rotavirus and sapovirus, meanwhile, tend to be concentrated in specific states, suggesting that outbreaks are the most common drivers of occurrence of these diseases. It is important to note, however, that these statistics are only a measure of reported cases, and that the actual incidence of viral disease could be significantly higher than the reported statistics indicate. For example, the CDC estimates that the rates of hepatitis A virus are approximately twice as high as reported incidence rates indicate [8].",

MDHSS maintains the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS) which publishes weekly disease reports on a number of communicable diseases [15]. Data taken from MDSS reports show an increase in viral disease over the past five years, as shown in Fig. 3. For this paper, gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses, influenza-like illnesses, hepatitis A illnesses, and norovirus illnesses are selected. While some GI illnesses and influenza-like illnesses may be caused by bacterial pathogens, a large percentage of GI illnesses and influenza-like illnesses are expected to be of viral origin and all hepatitis and norovirus illnesses are of viral origin. These diseases have been selected for investigation since they have different exposure pathways [16]. Influenza illnesses may be zoonotic but are not waterborne. Hepatitis A illnesses are waterborne but are not zoonotic. Norovirus is commonly foodborne, it may be waterborne, and it is not typically zoonotic. GI illnesses may be both waterborne and zoonotic and may be caused by viruses, bacteria, or paracites.",

While the report does not specify the etiological nature of the deaths, a portion of these illnesses are due to viral causes, illustrating the potential burden of viral disease on animals. The Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (MDARD) also publishes annual statistics on reportable animal diseases. The MDARD report from 2017 includes many viral animal disease cases, including 373 cases of bovine leukemia virus, 160 cases of caprine arthritis encephalitis, 17 cases of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 7 cases of swine enteric coronavirus, 9 cases of canine influenza, 7 cases of eastern equine encephalitis, 10 cases of equine herpesvirus, and 15 cases of West Nile virus in equines [21].",

Numerous environmental factors may contribute to the likelihood of infectious disease in certain areas or time periods, including but not limited to land use [22], precipitation [23], and population density [24]. Land use is relevant to determine the environmental state of the area, and can be impactful during runoff events. Precipitation levels inform where these runoff events may occur. Population and population density can affect the spread of viral disease and can also be used to normalize disease levels from one county to another. Other factors can be used to further characterize land use, such as information related to agricultural activity. Variables such as livestock population can not only illustrate the level of agricultural activity in an area, but also illustrate the expected quality of nearby surface water after runoff events.",

Independent variables were introduced into the OLS model based upon the prior exploratory data analysis; those with the highest correlations with disease levels were interpreted as the most likely predictors and were incorporated first, followed by the next highest correlation, and so on. The regression model was run each time a new variable was introduced. Those that did not exhibit a relationship with 85% confidence (i.e. p-value not <0.15) were omitted from further consideration.

This is an expected finding given that hepatitis A virus and norovirus are not thought to be zoonotic, whereas some influenza-like illnesses and GI illnesses, while uncommon, have the potential to be zoonotic. Similarly, the relationship of developed land with hepatitis A virus is much higher than with the other three diseases studied.

For example, as mentioned, GI illnesses have a correlation of 0.474 with annual precipitation on the spatial level, but this relationship is strongest in the month of May, when it reaches a correlation coefficient of 0.532. Moreover, the correlation coefficients between GI disease and precipitation increase in magnitude from February to May. This finding is interesting because the spring months are the times in which land application of fertilizers and manure are most common, as it is the beginning of the growing season. This relationship with precipitation, combined with the aforementioned relationship between GI disease and agricultural land use, strengthens the possibility that agricultural runoff could be a critical pathway for GI diseases in Michigan. Stronger relationships are also observed between the months of August and November and GI illnesses as well as the months of September and November and influenza-like illnesses. These correlations indicate that these months, in addition to the aforementioned spring months, could also be critical times at which runoff is an important pathway for the studied illnesses.",

For example, certain communities may have different access to local clinics than others; highly populated areas may be underserved by not having the necessary facilities to handle the population, or sparsely populated areas may not be within close enough proximity to accessible medical care. In future analysis this issue could be addressed by obtaining data on the number of clinics and medical facilities in each county and the number of visits to these facilities and normalizing this data to population.",

Environmental quality data are important factors that may be considered and results from environmental sampling and analysis may correlate with disease occurrence. For example, wastewater treatment plants and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) can be valuable sampling points, since sampling and characterizing community wastewater and livestock manure represents a snapshot of the status of community human and animal health.The Michigan Water Environment Association maintains a list of wastewater facilities in the state of Michigan [41]. Sampling can also take place at other locations, such as storm drains, agricultural field runoff drains, and areas that have recently experienced combined sewer overflows. Other agricultural data could also be valuable in determining sampling points in rural areas of the watershed, such as amount of fertilizer purchased per week per county and location of CAFOs. The Sierra Club maintains a readily available map of CAFOs throughout the United States, including in Michigan [42]. CAFO locations can help to determine where livestock populations are most abundant, heightening the risk for both animal disease and zoonotic disease. Beyond agricultural data, information on surface water quality can also be of use. For example, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) reports figures for public beach closures, which occur when surface water contamination is detected during regular screening for pathogen indicators. MDEQ also summarizes sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) and combined sewer overflow (CSO) events, which occur when wastewater levels in municipal sewer systems exceed the systems' capacity, resulting in untreated wastewater discharging into nearby surface waters.",

Using Michigan as an example, the relationship between precipitation and GI illness was strongest in the spring months, coinciding with land application of agricultural fertilizers. Additionally, these relationships were strongest in the area of the Grand River watershed, a large watershed in southwest Michigan encompassing Grand Rapids, Lansing, and surrounding agricultural areas. Therefore, sampling within this watershed in spring (from March to May) would be ideal to assess the impact of agricultural runoff on the occurrence of GI illness. This runoff would be at its peak when the flow rate of the Grand River would be highest. Therefore, examining the discharge of the Grand River can aid in determining the most critical times at which to sample. The USGS reports discharge data and water quality data for many surface waters and groundwaters in the United States, including the Grand River [44]. Animal disease data can also be collected and analyzed in this manner, but there remains a need for integrated human-animal disease surveillance to assess zoonotic disease occurrence [43].",
