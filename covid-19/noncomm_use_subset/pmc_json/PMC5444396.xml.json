However, in 2014, this number was 17, according to Takajo et al.,5 who also described another case. In this subset of patients, unlike the immunocompromised patients, the infection\u2019s clinical course was rapid and aggressive3,5,19 with the mortality rate ranging between 33% and 63.1%,3,5,20 occurring with a median time of 11 hours from admission to death.3 Acute clinical features were characterized by chest pain, dry cough, or bloody sputum/hemoptysis, accompanied by fever and hypotension with a rapid course to septic shock. Although any lung region can be involved, the upper right lobe is more frequently stricken.3 Hemoptysis is frequently observed due to the necrotizing vasculitis, accompanied by the parenchymal necrosis characteristic of the pathologic findings.21 Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Gram-negative rods in sputum, and culture positivity for P. aeruginosa, as well as by blood sample cultures since bacteremia is usually frequent (in up to 92% of cases)3; in this scenario, some studies evidenced Gram-negative bacteria invading the blood vessel walls.3,22,23",

Although, in the latter example, Pseudomonas was isolated in three samples (from a total of nine) collected from this nurse care, using PFGE none of the isolates matched with the strain isolated from the patient. Welders and foundry workers are also considered at occupational risk for P. aeruginosa pneumonia, probably due to dust containing metals.22,30,31 Nevertheless, machine operators using metalworking fluids are also at the same risk.32 Zell et al.33 reported the case of a healthy young man who acquired a P. aeruginosa pneumonia working in a place with aerosolized contaminated metalworking fluid, and mentioned that this CAP had been reported to the industrial injuries insurance companies as an occupational disease. Aqueous oil emulsions used in metal processing are frequently contaminated or colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, where they survive over a period of up to 250 days, and may show very fast proliferation.34\nPseudomonas represents the genus that most frequently colonizes cutting fluids.34 Indeed, P. aeruginosa was isolated from metalworking fluid (cutting fluid) in 17% of 150 examined samples in France,35 and in 48% (of 72 examined samples) in Zagreb (Croatia).34 Favoring this occupational correlation, Harrod et al.36 conducted an experimental model to evaluate the impact of inhaled diesel engine emissions (DEE) in modulating clearance of P. aeruginosa. Their findings concluded that environmental levels of DEE could decrease the clearance of P. aeruginosa and increase lung pathogenicity. In this report, P. aeruginosa was isolated from the metalworking fluid that was collected from the machine operated by the patient. The PGFE from both strains showed the same bacterial DNA-pattern, strongly arguing in favor of this fluid being the source of infection.",

In this setting, influenza pneumonia (H1N1 virus infection), hantavirus infection, pulmonary vasculitis, and leptospirosis could have been considered. However, the chest plain radiography showed a lobar condensation and other foci of occupying space opacity, which raised the suspicion of lobar pneumonia. In our case the diagnosis was confirmed by positeve blood culture, tracheal aspirate culture and positive immunohistochemistry reaction in pulmonary tissue using mouse monoclonal antibody anti- P aerugnosa.5 The clinical history and outcome of our case strictly followed the disastrous and fulminant pattern of P. aeruginosa CAP in a previously healthy person. In this case, we cannot neglect tobacco abuse as a risk factor, but we believe this case relates more to the patient\u2019s occupation. One of the machines operated by the patient uses metalworking fluid, which, unavoidably, is aerosolized. A similar case was reported in the literature,33 reinforcing our theses on the occupational relationship of our case.",

In these particular cases, Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa, should always be considered. Also, we would like to raise the possibility of a lobectomy in cases where Gram-negative bacilli are detected in pulmonary secretions accompanied by hemoptysis and signs of pulmonary parenchyma necrosis in the scenario of a life-threatening infection. We believe that these considerations may have a positive impact on changing the usual fatal outcome of theses cases.",
