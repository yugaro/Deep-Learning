An immunohistochemical stain to detect P. jirovecii was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with human and rodent pneumocystis cysts and trophozoites (Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Pneumocystis Jiroveci, Clone 3F6, Code M0778, Dako, Denmark). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was cultured by standard techniques [4]. Viruses other than CMV, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, were detected using direct immunofluorescence assays for respiratory virus screening and identification (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA). An amount of BAL fluid containing 103 cells was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Differential cell counting was used to determine the percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages [14]. Using a hemocytometer chamber, a medical laboratory technologist counted cells and a laboratory medicine specialist verified it.",

In a retrospective study done by Jansen et al., HIV-infected patients who died of respiratory complications had a higher neutrophil percentage in BAL fluid compared with patients who survived [19]. In a retrospective study of non-HIV-infected patients done at Asan Medical Center between 2007 and 2013, 30-day mortality increased to 40% in patients with PCP with a neutrophil percentage \u226550% in BAL fluid [14]. This association of neutrophils in BAL fluid and mortality was attributed to bacterial co-infection [19] and severe inflammatory reactions induced by neutrophil-producing cytokines [20]. This study also revealed a higher percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid in patients who experienced TMP/SMX treatment failure or ADRs. Regardless of a high neutrophil percentage, we found that absolute neutrophil count was not different between cases and controls and WBC count in BAL fluid was lower in patients with than in those without TMP/SMX treatment failure or ADRs (Table 1). A low lymphocyte count in BAL fluid may explain a high neutrophil percentage and low WBC count in BAL fluid. This result suggests that alveolar lymphocytes may play a more important role than alveolar neutrophil count in PCP pathogenesis. It is well known that blood lymphocyte count is important in PCP progression and prognosis [21-23]. However, there have been few studies on the association of BAL lymphocyte count and PCP prognosis. In a study on HIV-infected patients with respiratory complications, in which the rate of PCP was 40%, BAL fluid CD4 count was an independent risk factor for morality [14]. When those authors reviewed previous data collected between 2007 and 2013 at Asan Medical Center, both BAL lymphocyte percentage (2.2% [IQR, 8 \u2013 45%] vs. 40% [IQR, 29 \u2013 37%]; P = 0.005) and BAL absolute lymphocyte count (23/mm3 [IQR, 7 \u2013 104/mm3] vs. 67/ mm3 [IQR, 21 \u2013 147/mm3]; P = 0.02) were lower in patients who showed TMP/SMX treatment failure or ADRs, [14] as was the case in the present study. The proportion of BAL lymphocyte percentage \u2264 45% was also statistically significantly higher in such patients (53/69, 77% vs. 53/92, 58%; P = 0.01)[14]. These results suggest that not only blood lymphocyte count but also alveolar lymphocyte count plays an important role during PCP treatment.",

Old age, severity of disease as assessed by oxygen requirements and the need for mechanical ventilation, underlying conditions such as hematologic malignancy and vasculitis, and low CD4 count have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis [4, 24, 25]. However, this knowledge of non-modifiable prognostic factors is not helpful for establishing treatment strategies. On the contrary, knowledge of the risk factors associated with treatment failure or ADR during TMP/SMX usage allows for the creation of individualized treatment strategies for PCP. For instance, if a patient has all of the risk factors for which the positive predictive value of treatment failure or ADR during TMP/SMX usage is 100%, an alternative regimen such as C-P can be considered as the-first line regimen. Indeed, some studies on small numbers of patients with PCP showed a similar efficacy of TMP/SMX and C-P as first-line regimens [26-28]. In addition, like DM and GFR, low BAL lymphocyte might be a non-specific factor linked to underlying diseases rather than PCP treatment. Confirmatory conclusion should be postponed until a prospective study on a large number of patients with severe PCP show that the efficacy of the alternative regimen is not inferior to that of TMP/SMX. Further studies on individualized strategies using the risk factors identified in this study should be carried out.",

Since 2009, studies on PCP have been performed at Asan Medical Center and accumulating evidence has been reflected in standardized practices. Experienced infectious disease experts have decided on criteria for treatment failure as described in the Methods section. Standardization of practice can be indirectly verified by assessing BAL and simultaneously giving TMP/SMX as a first-line regimen and C-P as a second-line regimen to most patients. This standardized practice may have resulted in a better prognosis in the current study, compared with previous studies [4]. Second, composite parameters of treatment failure and ADR was used to evaluate outcome in the study. In the subgroup analysis of risk factors associated with treatment failure, DM and BAL lymphocyte was still significant. Third, heterogeneous underlying conditions could affect the outcomes of PCP. Further studies are needed in patients with specific homogenous underlying conditions, such as HIV and solid organ transplantation.",
