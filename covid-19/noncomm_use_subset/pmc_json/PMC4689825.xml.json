MERS-CoV was isolated from a Saudi Arabian man who died of progressive respiratory and renal failure in 2012 (1). Since then, several cases of MERS-CoV infection have shown renal function impairment (23), and some of those cases have required renal replacement therapy. In addition, a MERS-CoV outbreak was reported in a hemodialysis unit in Saudi Arabia (4). Therefore, MERS-CoV may include kidney tropism.",

Patients also underwent serial chest X-ray tests, and chest computed tomography was performed when clinically indicated.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were significant risk factors for acute renal impairment, and acute renal impairment was an independent risk factor predicting mortality. However, kidney specimens from autopsy cases showed no viral inclusions or electron dense deposits. Even in situ hybridization failed to demonstrate SARS-CoV. This suggested that renal insult occurred in the context of multiple organ failure.

Unfortunately, MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction from urine was performed in only one patient 6 weeks after symptom onset in this cohort to ensure the virus absence from various specimens, and it was negative. We can conclude that the renal pathological changes associated with human coronavirus may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by virus replication, as well as indirectly by a systemic toxic reaction resulting from respiratory failure or a harmful immune response and cytokine reaction induced by viral infection.",

DPP 4 is a widely expressed serine peptidase that exists on the surface of various cell types, and the expression of messenger RNA and protein is high in the kidneys (619). DPP 4 is one of the major brush border membrane proteins of the kidney (8), but it is also present in the glomerular podocytes and capillaries (9). DPP 4, which is present on the surfaces of human bronchial epithelial cells, was previously co-stained with MERS-CoV (20) and a MERS-CoV infected human kidney cell line (21). We performed kidney biopsy in one patient to evaluate persistent proteinuria 8 weeks after symptom onset, which failed to reveal virus particles that were co-stained with DPP 4 in compatible ultrastructures.

One explanation for the difference in AKI incidence may be the different criteria used to define AKI. In that study, AKI was defined as a SCr elevation at least 30% of the baseline value on admission (3 consecutive blood samplings) or above 1.8 mg/dL. When we adopted the same definition in the present cohort, AKI occurred in 7 patients (23.3%), which is still higher than the AKI incidence of SARS-CoV infection. Another explanation may be the older age of MERS-CoV patients in the present study. The mean age was 54 yr in the present cohort and approximately 39 yr in the SARS-CoV cohort. Because age was an independent risk factor for AKI in both studies, the older age of MERS-CoV patients might explain the higher incidence of AKI in the present study. In a previous study, a patient whose viral RNA was not detected in whole blood or urine samples had a more favorable outcome than a patient who showed disseminated viral infection (22). The investigators in that study concluded that a type-1 interferon mediated response triggered by MERS-CoV might limit the viral disease to the lung and prevent systemic dissemination and viremia. A decreased immune response in older patients may play a role in the higher occurrence of AKI through viremia and urinary viral excretion, though we did not assess serial viral RNA in blood and urine. In addition, this cohort was from central MERS-CoV designated hospital and we cannot rule out that patients in this cohort had more underlying diseases than other MERS-CoV patients in Korea and that the incidence of AKI occurrence might be overestimated.",

The highest mean levels of random urine were 1,986 mg/g Cr for ACR, which occurred 4 days after symptom onset, and 6,105 mg/g Cr for PCR, which occurred 27 days after symptom onset. Early phase high albumin excretion may be related to fever and systemic inflammatory status, and high-level proteinuria approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset may be associated with viremia or urinary virus excretion, which was similar to the occurrence of AKI (16). However, we did not assess serial viremic status, and a blood sample 6 weeks after symptom onset was negative for MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction. The detection rates of SARS-CoV in blood samples were only 21%-50% between the second and third weeks after viral infection (14). A direct involvement of the kidneys by the MERS-CoV could not be ruled out, because we performed the blood assay 6 weeks after symptom onset.",

Second, we received only a positive status for MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests, except for Ct values. Therefore, we could not assess correlations between viral load and the renal complications. Third, we did not have compatible renal pathology data. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the direct effect of the virus on renal complications.",

The incidence of AKI was not uncommon, and AKI can be affected by factors including the virus itself, associated systemic inflammation, and hypotension. Meticulous evaluation and management of kidney damage such as quantitative assessment of proteinuria and frequent monitoring of eGFR is earnestly needed. Old age is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of AKI; diabetes, AKI, and the application of CRRT are negative prognostic indicators for survival with MERS-CoV. Further studies are needed to reveal the direct effects of MERS-CoV on renal complications.",
