According to the framework, different agencies will be designated as the competent authority based on the type of disaster. For example, when a typhoon strikes Taiwan, the National Fire Agency will take the major responsibility for disaster response. However, every department in the government participates in the response in the event of a disaster. The framework also regulates work details and roles in pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis disaster stages.16",

For example, after a flood, there are often many cases of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is spread through dirty water. The Taiwan Center for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) will mobilize staff to activate the Infectious Disease Emergency Response Team if the spread of infectious disease becomes a concern post-disaster. The team will provide environmental disinfection, vaccine resource management, epidemic surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, and health education in collaboration with local health officials and first responders.18",

Without knowing the disease treatment, prevention, and control measures, public health authorities may need to rely on past experiences to execute response efforts, including epidemiologic investigations and control measures. Therefore, the command structure of CECC is designed to be very flexible in order to dispatch the department's resources efficiently and meet response needs appropriately.
