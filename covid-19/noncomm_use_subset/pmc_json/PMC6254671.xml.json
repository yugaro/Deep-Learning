MERS involves high fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, chills, chest pain, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, running nose, renal failure, and pneumonia. The first case of MERS in humans was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. After 2012, within a span of only 4 years, MERS-CoV infection was reported from 27 countries.1 Three MERS outbreaks have already occurred in Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015).2\u20134 The outbreak reported in South Korea also involved spread of MERS through hospital-to-hospital transit of patients and had the fatality rate as high as 40%. High attack rate and easy spread of MERS indicate an epidemic risk.5\u20137 To date, no specific vaccine is available for MERS. The steep increase in MERS cases and its high mortality rate demand an urgent need for specific and safe MERS vaccine. Thus far, only little information is known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Hence, an immunoinformatics approach to thoroughly study and screen immunogenic proteins from the available proteome sequence data of MERS-CoV is essential for vaccine design.",

            "text": "The proteome of MERS-CoV consists of several important vaccine candidate and drug target proteins. These proteins are involved in infection and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV to human host cells. Spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, its receptor-binding domain, is involved in virus and host cell interaction.8 Envelope (E) protein plays an important role in host cell recognition.9 Nucleocapsid (N) protein is involved in RNA binding during ribonucleocapsid formation by MERS-CoV.10 Membrane (M) protein has interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, thus reducing IFN levels in infected patients.11 Open reading frame (ORF) proteins also play critical roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. A mutation study of ORFs (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5) indicated that ORFs have major implications in viral infection involving disruption of host cell processes, dysregulated IFN pathway activation, and abrupt inflammation.12 Proteins ORF1a (4P16) and ORF1ab (4WUR) are papain-like proteases (PL(pro)) involved in viral infection and are potential targets for the development of antiviral drugs.13 PL(pro) facilitate infection by their proteolytic, deubiquitinating, and deISGylating activities suppressing innate immune response from the host cell. Protein ORF1a (4RSP), a protease (3CLpro), facilitates proteolytic activity during viral infection and replication.14,15 Protein ORF1ab (5WWP) is a helicase protein of MERS-CoV, and it is one of the most conserved proteins among nidoviruses. Protein ORF8b is a highly conserved protein, and during infection, it induces various immune responses.16",
