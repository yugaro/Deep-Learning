In Vero cells, IFN-\u03b12b reduced the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) starting at a concentration of 250 U/ml and completely eliminated CPE at 1000 U/ml and above (Figure 1A). Ribavirin reduced CPE starting at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml and completely eliminated CPE at 200 \u03bcg/ml and above (Figure 1A). Viral protein levels, as measured by nucleocapsid protein expression in cell lysates, were also reduced in the presence of increasing levels of IFN-\u03b12b, with a reduction starting at 250 U/ml (Figure 1B). In response to ribavirin treatment, a reduction in nucleocapsid protein expression was observed at 50 \u03bcg/ml, but did not appear to be dose dependent (Figure 1B).",

Peak viral loads and infectious virus were recovered from day 3 samples; therefore, this time point was used for subsequent analysis. Supernatants collected on day 5 frequently had lower viral loads and titers than samples collected on day 3, likely due to extensive CPE. As such, day 5 samples were not included in the analyses. A dose dependent reduction in genome copies was observed for IFN-\u03b12b treatment with a 0.53-log reduction in viral loads at 500 U/ml reaching a 1.84-log reduction at 5000 U/ml (Figure 2A).

Combination treatment in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells lowered the threshold at which a decrease in CPE was noted. For Vero cells, this was reduced to 62 U/ml IFN-\u03b12b and 12 \u03bcg/ml ribavirin with the absence of CPE at and above 125 U/ml IFN-\u03b12b and 25 \u03bcg/ml ribavirin (Figure 1A). This represents an 8- and 16-fold decrease in the amount of IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin, respectively, which is required to achieve the same reduction as either treatment alone. Viral nucleocapsid protein expression was also reduced in a dose dependent manner starting at concentrations of IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin of 250 U/ml and 50 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Figure 1B). The reduction in CPE and nucleocapsid protein expression also correlated with reduced virus genome copies and titers. When IFN-\u03b12b was administered with ribavirin at 5:1 ratio, there was an additional reduction in the virus titer by 0.4- to 2.16-logs over that of IFN-\u03b12b treatment alone (Figure 4).",

Given the genetic relationship of hCoV-EMC/2012 to other bat coronaviruses5, one can speculate that bats may be the reservoir of this virus; however, additional host species should be considered. With documented human-to-human transmission in close contact situations, and the first documented mild case22, there is a real concern that we could be observing the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 and perhaps the start of an epidemic. Regardless, with a 65% case-fatality rate despite intensive medical intervention, therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Despite the significant increase in research on coronaviruses since the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003, there is no definitive antiviral or therapeutic treatment for coronavirus infections in humans. Pegylated interferon-\u03b1 was shown to be an effective prophylactic treatment against infection with SARS-CoV in cynomolgus macaques, but was less effective when administered post exposure23. No other therapeutics have been tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in a higher order animal model. In the SARS-CoV mouse model, poly IC:LC24 and mDEF201 (an adenovirus expressing mouse IFN-\u03b1)25 can protect mice from lethal disease; however, neither of these approaches yields an immediate therapeutic for use in humans. Poly IC:LC has been tested in numerous clinical trials, but is not currently approved for treatment of any human disease. Adenovirus-based therapy has multiple complicating factors, such as pre-existing immunity, that have not been adequately addressed, nor is it approved for use in humans26.",

The sensitivity of SARS-CoV to ribavirin appears to be cell line dependent, with concentrations as low as 50 \u03bcg/ml ribavirin being reported as effective16. Unfortunately, this concentration is higher than the peak serum concentration reached in humans of approximately 24 \u03bcg/ml35. IFN-\u03b12b was previously reported to inhibit growth of SARS-CoV starting at 1000 U/ml with a 1-log reduction at 2000 U/ml34. Following infection, only IFN-\u03b2 (EC50 560 IU/ml) has shown a dose dependent antiviral effect36. In this study we report a nearly 4-log reduction in virus titers for hCoV-EMC/2012 at comparable doses.",

            "text": "During the outbreak of SARS-CoV, different combinations of therapeutic interventions were attempted; however, none were implemented in a manner that allowed a critical assessment of their effectiveness. The most frequently administered therapeutics were broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids and ribavirin373839. The lack of a standard dosing regimen for ribavirin makes comparisons difficult18; however, low dose ribavirin (400\u2013600 mg/day) therapy was shown to be ineffective likely due to an insufficient plasma concentration40. In contrast, when used at higher doses other studies have found that ribavirin alone reduced viral loads in over half of the patients and when combined with the viral protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir, patients had a lower incidence of adverse outcomes16. Despite being used in a large number of patients, it still remains unclear whether ribavirin alone was effective against SARS-CoV41. Alfacon-1, a synthetic IFN-\u03b1, has also been suggested to be beneficial to patients17. Unfortunately, all of these studies suffer from the confounding use of corticosteroids in doses that vary among studies making a definitive treatment elusive. It has been suggested that combination of interferon and ribavirin treatment should be evaluated18. While ribavirin can result in reversible hemolytic anemia, this complication typically occurs following longer treatment protocols3542. This suggests that short-course ribavirin therapy for an acute infection such as nCoV may not be a significant complication as mild anemia was the most frequently reported side effect during ribavirin treatment for Lassa virus infection43.",

The levels of IFN\u03b1-2b and ribavirin required for inhibition of nCoV replication must be achievable in humans in order to be relevant for clinical use. In humans, an interferon concentration of 100-750 IU/ml has been observed after intravenous injection of up to 3 \u00d7 107 U4647, while 24 \u03bcg/ml of ribavirin is achievable following a 1000 mg intravenous dose35. Here IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin alone were shown to have an antiviral effect against hCoV-EMC/2012; however, in Vero cells the concentrations required to achieve a beneficial effect are likely higher than what is achievable in humans. When combined, the inhibitory concentration of both IFN\u03b1-2b and ribavirin drops to ranges that are likely achievable in humans, suggesting that the combination is a potential treatment option. Used early in the course of infection or given prophylactically to close contacts of sick individuals (close contact transmission has been documented in infection chains) this combination may improve clinical outcomes. In addition, reduced viral load would also likely translate to reduced virus shedding; thus, reducing the risk of secondary transmission. As these two drugs are currently used together in the clinic, combination therapy including IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin should be considered for case patient management of new nCoV cases and possibly for prophylaxis in highly exposed individuals.",
