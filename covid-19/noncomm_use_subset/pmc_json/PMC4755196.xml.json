In this paper, K\u00f6hler and Milstein describe a protocol to immortalize antibody\u2010producing B cells by fusing them to myeloma cells. The resulting fusion product combined the antibody\u2010producing capacity of the original B cell or plasma cell and the immortality of the myeloma cells. Cloned lines of the fusion products were called hybridomas and produced relatively large amounts of antibodies, which were called monoclonal antibodies. The impact of the hybridoma technology cannot be underestimated. Nowadays monoclonal antibodies have found applications in virtually all branches of life sciences. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies was quickly recognized resulting in a large number of lifesaving therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies that are currently produced and marketed by the pharmaceutical industry.",

The first antibody approved for the clinic was OKT3, an antibody against the human CD3\u03b5 component of the T\u2010cell receptor complex 2. OKT3 was approved for treatment in transplantation and deleted T cells, thereby reducing the damaging effects of T cell\u2010mediated antigraft reactions. The clinical utility of OKT3 turned out to be limited by its immunogenicity in humans, among other problems, as OKT3 is a mouse antibody. Second\u2010generation therapeutic antibodies were chimeric antibodies in which the constant domains of the mouse immunoglobulin were replaced with those of human. Two examples of such chimeric antibodies are rituximab, an antibody against the B\u2010cell antigen CD20, which is used for therapy in B\u2010cell malignancies and various other diseases, and infliximab, an antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1 used in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Advances in antibody engineering resulted in techniques to fully humanize the mouse antibodies by grafting the complementarity determining region (CDR)3 regions into the human immunoglobulin (Ig)G framework. Although humanization of mouse antibodies is still used, animals with human Ig genes are now being used by a growing number of companies to raise therapeutic antibodies. In parallel with the use of mice with human Ig genes and the technical advances with antibody humanization, other technologies have been developed to directly generate fully human antibodies. Phage display is one of those technologies. This method uses a library of bacteriophages that have been engineered to display antibody fragments on their surface. These bacteriophages are screened for binding to target proteins in order to identify the antibody fragments of interest (reviewed in 3). The technology has an advantage over animal\u2010based methods as human B cells can be used to make the Ig libraries representing the naturally occurring repertoire. However, phage display antibodies are frequently unstable because of their artificial pairing of heavy and light chains. Currently, only three antibodies have been approved for clinical use, amongst which the TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010specific antibody adalimumab.",

This includes capturing the complete B\u2010cell repertoire and the generation of stable immortalized B cells. Although fusion of B cells and myeloma cells has been the method of choice to immortalize antibody\u2010producing mouse B cells, there are several drawbacks that limit its applicability to isolate rare B cells. First is that the efficiency of immortalization is rather low. Only a very low proportion of the total mouse B\u2010cell repertoire is captured by the hybridoma technology and clones are often instable. Secondly, whereas the technology works well with mouse and rat B cells, attempts to generate hybridomas with human B cells had limited success. This is caused by the lack of good fusion partners for the human B cells. Recently, the success rate has been improved by the development of better fusion partners and technical advances in using electrofusion 4, 5.",

Although a number of interesting monoclonal antibodies have been generated (for instance, 10), this technology has its limitations as B cells expand transiently in this protocol. Therefore, this method offers only a limited window of opportunity for finding the desired antigen\u2010specific clone. One possible reason for the limited proliferative capacity of B cells stimulated by CD40L and cytokines is that the activated B cells differentiate to plasma cells in this setting. Plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells and unable to proliferate. The observation by our group that forced expression of BCL\u20106 (which is known to inhibit terminal differentiation to plasma cells) in activated B cells enables these cells to continue proliferating in response to cytokines and CD40L is consistent with this hypothesis 11, 12.

STAT5 is likely to be involved in the proliferation of human B cells as knockdown of STAT5 using RNA interference strongly decreased proliferation of B cells stimulated with CD40L in the presence of IL\u20102 and IL\u20104 15. To determine the exact role of STAT5 in B\u2010cell functions, we expressed a fusion of STAT5 with a mutated domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) and STAT3 in activated B cells and examined the response of these cells following incubation with 4\u2010hydroxy tamoxifen (4 HT). It was observed that addition of 4 HT strongly enhanced the proliferative response of B cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of STAT5 resulted in long\u2010term in vitro proliferation of B cells cultured with CD40L and cytokines, whereas control transduced B cells proliferated only for a limited period of time. These results contradict those of studies in mouse models that have demonstrated that STAT5 is involved in early B\u2010cell development but not in B\u2010cell maturation. Deletion of STAT5 in B cells using CD19 CRE and floxed STAT5 alleles did not result in diminished antibody production 16. Also, STAT5\u2010deficient mouse B cells proliferate normally in response to IgM stimulation and IL\u20104 16. Perhaps the growth\u2010promoting effect of IL\u20104 in mice is exclusively mediated by STAT6, whereas in humans STAT5 may be involved in this process as well.",

The effects of overexpression of active STAT5 in human B cells are however not identical to those of BCL\u20106. Most notably, continued overexpression and activation of STAT5 eventually result in downregulation of Ig gene expression and other B cell markers, presumably because of epigenetic repression 18.

BCL\u20106 functions to support proliferation and to inhibit differentiation of proliferating B cells to plasma cells in mice 20 and humans 11. BCL\u20106 also allows activation\u2010induced cytidine deaminase (AID)\u2010mediated somatic hyper mutations (SHM) and class switch recombinations (CSR) which involves extensive DNA modifications by counteracting a DNA damage response. BCL\u20106 regulates AID through repression of the microRNA, mir\u2010155 21. Plasma cells are characterized by the expression of a different set of transcription factors \u2013 the most important are BLIMP\u20101 (encoded by PRDM1), which is essential for plasma cell differentiation 22, and XBP\u20101, which is needed for the formation of the machinery to secrete large amounts of antibodies 23, 24. BCL\u20106 and BLIMP1 crossregulate each other as BCL\u20106 protein can bind to the PDRM1 locus and repress expression of BLIMP1, thereby inhibiting plasma cell differentiation 11, 25. The ratio of BCL\u20106 and BLIMP1 is therefore one of the determining factors whether an activated B cell is poised to become a plasma cell or a memory cell type. The finding that forced expression of BCL\u20106 inhibits plasma cell differentiation and allows for sustained proliferation of activated B cells was confirmed in other species including non\u2010human primates, rabbits, llamas, and mice.",

That CSR and SHM use different domains of AID and therefore can be uncoupled from SHM and gene conversion has been shown before.

AD\u2010HIES is caused by mutations in STAT3 resulting in expression of dominant negative STAT3 which reduces STAT3 function 27, 28. These patients show a high susceptibility to microbial pathogens due to deficiencies in the functions of a variety of immune cells. T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antibody production is strongly affected. Although STAT3 deficiency impairs the function of T follicular helper cells, thereby hampering B\u2010cell help 29, deficiencies in STAT3 function also intrinsically affect the capacity of B cells to differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting plasmablasts 30. There are several cytokines that can induce STAT3 in activated B cells including IL\u201010 and IL\u201021. Of those, IL\u201021 is most likely the dominant STAT3 inducer in B cells as patients with IL\u201021R mutations have deficiencies in antibody responses 31. Moreover, IL\u201021 most strongly induces expression of PDRM1 and XBP\u20101 in activated naive and memory B cells resulting in plasma cell differentiation and increased antibody production 11, 32. To study the effects of STAT3 activation in the absence of cytokine signaling, we followed the same approach as with STAT5, expressing a fusion of STAT3 with a mutated domain of ER in activated B cells and examined the response of these cells following incubation with 4 HT. These experiments revealed that activation of STAT3 itself increased expression of BLIMP1 and XBP1 similar to IL\u201021, suggesting that these transcription factors are controlled by STAT3 11. However, whereas BCL\u20106 was induced by IL\u201021, it was not induced by STAT3. Because IL\u201021 transiently induces STAT5 phosphorylation and BCL6 is a direct target of STAT5 in human B cells 15, it is likely that IL\u201021 regulates BCL\u20106 through STAT5. However, STAT5 and BCL\u20106 are not sustained by IL\u201021, and eventually B cells cultured with IL\u201021 and CD40L differentiate terminally to plasma cells 11.",

Using memory IgG+ B cells derived from peripheral blood from healthy individuals including daycare providers who should be frequently exposed to respiratory viruses, we isolated a series of B\u2010cell clones producing RSV F\u2010specific antibodies 12. Of these antibodies, D25, AM23, and AM14 neutralize RSV A and B strains with a potency 100\u2010fold greater than palivizumab. We demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for an F structural determinant that is not present on inactivated virus or viral lysates. The reason for this was unraveled when McLellan et al. determined the exact structure of the F protein by crystallography. It became clear that the structure targeted by the antibodies D25, AM23, and AM14 was the prefusion F trimer 53. The epitope on F recognized by D25 was annotated as the \u00f8 domain, which is an epitope located at the membrane\u2010distal apex of the RSV F glycoprotein, and thereby D25 locks the F protein in its prefusion state. AM14 is binding another quaternary epitope between 2 F protomers making it extremely specific for binding prefusion F trimers 54. In vitro, these F\u2010specific antibodies neutralize a broad selection of subgroup A and subgroup B RSV clinical isolates. The advantage of prefusion\u2010specific antibodies is that they only recognize F protein in its native conformation on virus particles and on infected cells and do not recognize free monomeric protein which is probably more abundantly present during infection and may serve as a sink for antibodies like palivizumab which recognize both pre\u2010 and postfusion F structures. Antibodies D25, AM23, and AM14 also have potent in vivo activity in cotton rats 12.",

To give full protection after birth, the serum half\u2010life of MEDI8897 is prolonged by specific YTE mutations in the Fc tail thereby increasing its affinity for the FcRn receptor. This should keep serum antibody levels high enough to give protection for the whole RSV season 55. This was confirmed in a phase I study in which the YTE mutation resulted in an astonishing half\u2010life of the modified D25 antibody of 90 days. It is therefore likely that only one injection during the RSV season is sufficient to confer protection whereas four injections of palivizumab are needed to confer protection. This protection against RSV disease in early life is important to prevent serious damage to the lungs and recurrent wheezing as discussed above.",

BCL6/BCL\u2010XL\u2010transduced B cells have a plasmablast\u2010like phenotype secreting antibodies in the supernatant and expressing the BCR on their surface, which makes them an excellent source for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies. Libraries encompassing hundreds of thousands of B cells can be established from individuals who produce exceptional antibodies, facilitating rapid antibody discovery and allowing investigators to search for rare B cells that make unique antibodies. We have discussed examples of broadly reacting highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against pathogenic viruses that were isolated from selected individuals. The method can also easily be applied to probe the B\u2010cell repertoire of cancer patients who respond favorably to immunotherapies for antibodies that recognize tumor antigens. We have already been able to identify antibodies from B cells of cancer patients that recognize new and unexpected targets on the cell surface of tumor cells. Future work in this area should provide us not only with a better understanding of the contribution of B cells to the immune response against malignant cells but will also allow the discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies.",

Surprisingly, SHM are observed in these cells but not CSR, indicating that yet to be identified signals are required for AID\u2010mediated CSR. Aside from the scientific questions that AID expression in BCL\u20106/BCL\u2010XL\u2010transduced B cells raises, we could use this feature to generate subclones of antigen\u2010specific B cells that secrete antibodies with either higher or lower affinities than of the antibody produced by the parental clone, thereby offering a method to affinity mature antibodies without the need for extensive molecular engineering.",
