Children with viral illnesses who had a fever were more likely to have\ndiagnoses of pneumonia, whether they had RSV-positive or RSV-negative illness. The\nliterature supports the need to be wary of the possibility of bacterial pneumonia in\nchildren with bronchiolitis. RSV infection decreases bacterial clearance,\npotentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung\ncellular inflammation, and suggests that functional changes occur in the recruited\nneutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance.5 Bacterial infection, based on a significant rise of antibody titer and/or on\ndetection of pneumococcal antigen in serum or urine, was observed in 39% of the\nchildren with RSV infection. We conclude that a bacterial pathogen should be\nactively sought when managing patients with lower respiratory tract syndromes,\nespecially in those who have evidence of RSV infection.6 The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and\nclinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently\ninitiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Early\nrecognition and treatment of these patients will lessen morbidity and mortality.6 Based on the findings at our institution, we believe that fever is a marker\nindicating a need to investigate for bacterial pneumonia. There are several\nlimitations to our study. Since sputum cultures are not collected unless a patient\nis intubated, a definitive bacterial cause cannot be confirmed in most cases. As\npreviously discussed in methods, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is a physician\njudgment. Part of the reason our study is important is that literature does not\nelucidate any way to definitively determine the presence of bacterial pneumonia in a\nnon-intubated child. Several studies have tried to address this issue. CRP is\nelevated when bacterial pneumonia is present, but it has less than desirable\nspecificity for distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia.7,8 Procalcitonin is a better\nindicator than CRP. A procalcitonin less <0.1 has been found to rule out\nbacterial infection; however, higher values show overlap in procalcitonin levels\nfound in viral and bacterial sources.9 Therefore, we are left with clinical judgement based on looking at multiple\nfactors. Since laboratory testing and imaging are discouraged in the initial\nmanagement of bronchiolitis, perhaps fever can indicate such testing is justified to\nassist physicians in clinical decision making.",
