            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are important pathogens causing clinical disease in domestic cats worldwide.1 The prevalences reported in the literature vary widely depending on the geographical location and clinical characteristics of the study populations,2 with infections less commonly reported in healthy cats and confined cats compared with clinically unwell cats and free-roaming cats.3\u20138 Both viruses spread directly through bite wounds.3,9,10 Sexual contact, vertical transmission and social interactions such as mutual grooming or shared food or water dishes are more important transmission pathways for FeLV than FIV.11,12 Unsurprisingly, cats that are aggressive, sexually intact, frequently in contact with other cats or observed fighting have been identified as being significantly more likely to test positive for either pathogen.8,13\u201315 Experimental studies have shown that susceptibility to FeLV decreases significantly with age, with almost 100% of newborn kittens developing persistent viraemia after inoculation vs only 15% of kittens over 4 months of age.16,17 Since there are currently no effective treatments for FeLV and FIV,18 the cornerstone of disease management in clinical practice is preventing new infections through vaccination or segregation.19 Many cats diagnosed with FeLV die or are euthanased within 2\u20133 years owing to clinical complications,20 while FIV-positive cats can remain asymptomatic for many years.21,22 Diagnostic testing is therefore important for determining the infection status of cats to inform clinical decisions,23 but may not be performed routinely in private practice.24",

Two studies published in the early 1980s reported the prevalence of FeLV in cattery populations at between 4.4% and 11%,25,26 while another more recent study from 2013 estimated the national prevalences of FeLV and FIV at 5.5% and 10%, respectively, based on 200 blood samples submitted to a commercial diagnostic laboratory for routine haematological testing.27 There has also been some recent work to characterise the molecular epidemiology of FIV in New Zealand to determine whether the commercially available vaccine is likely to be effective against the currently circulating subtypes.28,29 However, since vaccination against FIV is relatively uncommon in New Zealand,30 and the last commercially available vaccine for FeLV was removed from the domestic market in March 2016 owing to low sale volumes, these tools are not currently being utilised to protect patient populations. Gathering better baseline data on disease occurrence, risk factors and clinical outcomes will be important for guiding discussions on how we can better manage these diseases moving forward.",

The results from the univariable and multivariable analyses were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Survival curves for FIV-positive cats, FeLV-positive cats and FeLV/FIV-negative cats were estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier product limit method. For cats with no recorded euthanasia or death event, the survival times were right-censored at the last recorded date the cat was seen at the practice or the last recorded phone conversation where the cat was known to be alive. The log-rank test for censored data was used to compare difference in survival times between FIV-positive vs FIV-negative and FeLV-positive vs FeLV-negative cats. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software.31",

First, veterinarians who responded to our survey indicated that the majority of cats were only tested because there was a high index of suspicion for disease, such as the presence of compatible clinical signs, known exposure to infected animals and presentation for bite wounds. These have previously been identified as risk factors for FIV,2,8,13 and we would therefore expect a higher occurrence of disease in this population compared with cats selected at random. Even though most cats were not retested for confirmation, previous research has demonstrated a good correlation between the presence of FIV antibodies on ELISA and the presence of proviral DNA on blood PCR, which is indicative of active infection.33 Second, false-positive reactions can occur on the FIV antibody tests used in practice owing to previous FIV vaccination or the presence of maternal antibodies.34\u201336 Although it is unlikely that veterinarians would have tested a known vaccinated cat, many patients present with an incomplete medical history and it is therefore possible that some of the tested cats were previously vaccinated. Third, in the free-text comments of our survey, several veterinarians indicated that they had stopped testing for FIV and FeLV in-house because clinical cases were rare in their practice regions.

However, <2% of client-owned cats across New Zealand were tested for FeLV and FIV over a single calendar year. Similar low levels of compliance with testing guidelines have been reported in the USA, even when testing was offered at no cost to the client.24 In the free-text comments of the national clinic survey, one veterinarian indicated that routine testing was not performed because a positive diagnosis was unlikely to change the management or clinical outcome for the patient, particularly since many clients were reluctant to confine their cats. To our knowledge, there has been little research to date in the field of FeLV and FIV epidemiology exploring client perceptions and responses to positive diagnoses.

For example, FeLV is traditionally considered a pathogen that requires prolonged close friendly contact like mutual grooming or shared water for transmission given the poor survivability of the virus in the environment.43,44 Housemates that are indoor\u2013outdoor may have fewer close contacts. Similar to other studies from the USA,8 Australia32 and Germany,2 we found that being male significantly increased the risk of FeLV and FIV test positivity. From a behavioural perspective, male cats have been shown to have more aggressive tendencies, leading to a greater risk of bite wounds.24,45 The majority of cats in our study were also already neutered, which may explain why this was not found to be a significant risk factor.",

Although vaccination rates were still low prior to March 2016 when the vaccine was removed,30 our study found that FeLV vaccines were primarily administered to high-risk cats. It will be important to monitor how the epidemiology of the disease changes now that these cats can no longer be protected. Several practices declined to participate in the national survey because they were unable to easily query their practice data to obtain summary data on the number of feline patients and results from the diagnostic testing. New initiatives are currently underway in New Zealand to improve data capture from electronic medical records that will hopefully make these type of monitoring studies easier in the future.46,47",
