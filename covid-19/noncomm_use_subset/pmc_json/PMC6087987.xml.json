In response to this outbreak, the provincial government\nand infectious disease control center (GIDCC) initiated an emergency department (ED)\nbased Gyeonggi-do provincial acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance network\n(GAFINet) to monitor for a subsequent outbreak of emerging or imported infectious\ndiseases since September 2016. Gyeonggi-do province is located in the North-West of\nSouth Korea, surrounds the capital city Seoul, and borders North Korea (Figure 1).\nConsidering the geographical coverage, GAFINet Initiative involves ten hospitals,\nconsisted of four university-affiliated hospitals and six provincial medical centers\nin Gyeonggi-do province. These hospitals participated in this network voluntarily,\nand most staffs including five infectious diseases specialists had direct or\nindirect experiences in dealing with MERS-CoV patients.",

AFI was defined as 1) fever: body temperature\n\u226538 \u00b0C at admission, or 2) chief complaint of febrile or chilling\nsensation. Demography of patients and chief complaints were investigated in this\nfirst step (CRF #1). Cases were classified into six categories based on their\nclinical diagnoses: 1) respiratory AFI [AFRI], 2) gastroenteric AFI [AFGI], 3)\nexanthematic AFI [AFEI], 4) other infectious AFI, 5) non-infectious AFI, and 6)\nunclassified AFI. Participating infectious diseases specialists regularly reviewed\nand reformed this classification. Because the aim of GAFINet is primarily monitoring\ncommunity- or aboard-acquired infection, nosocomial AFI cases or the patients\ntransferred from another hospital were excluded. When a patient had a history of\ninternational travel or he/she were undiagnosed in three days after ED admission,\nmore comprehensive information (CRF#2 & #3) including history and final\ndiagnosis were obtained. For a baseline data, age- and sex-stratified ED visits were\nalso gathered weekly. The proportion of AFI cases per 1000 visits was determined for\none week period and analyzed by febrile diseases categories with age-stratification.\nCharacteristics of cases with international travel histories or undiagnosed cases\nwere also described separately.",

The proportion of AFRI was the\nlargest, 33.64 to 71.96 per 1000 visits/week, and the second-largest was the other\ninfectious AFI. The proportion of AFRI showed the highest rate at the age 1-9 years,\nwhile those of AFGI and AFEI were the highest at the age under 19 year and 70-79\nyears, respectively. 31 cases with international travel history were reported, and\nthe majority of them traveled China and South East Asian counties. Some of them were\nsuspected cases of Zika viral infection, MERS-CoV, or viral hemorrhagic fever. 3\ncases undiagnosed until discharge were also reported.",
