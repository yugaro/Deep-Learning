Male and female workers were targeted during recruitment. However, as this study was mainly targeting workers who were in direct physical contact with the pilgrims, staff not in direct contact with the pilgrims was excluded. To answer the research questions of this study, purposive, non-random sampling was performed to recruit the targeted sample. Study participants were grouped into health workers and non-health workers to study any significant differences relating to knowledge, and behavior related to public health events. This grouping was mainly conducted due to the observed variation in the proportions of recruited workers from non-health workers.",

Almost all airport workers were aware that risk of infection can be reduced by adhering to precautionary measures. The most frequently reported method of infection risk reduction is wearing a facemask followed by wearing gloves. A lower proportion of non-health workers reported vaccinations compared with health workers as a preventive measure. Similarly, the proportion of non-health workers who reported hand washing as a preventive measure was lower compared with health workers. The detected variation in knowledge regarding preventive measures among non-health workers compared with health workers might suggest that non-health workers are generally aware that infectious diseases transmission could be prevented, but were less able to report specific preventive measures compared with health workers.",

However, at the time of conducting this study, there was no isolation facility at the airport. This is the first study conducted to measure the level of knowledge and behavior relating to the public health emergency measures of workers at Prince Mohammed International Airport at Al-Madinah. However, a study conducted by Al-Ghamdi and Kabbash11 investigated the knowledge of health workers regarding preventive measures against communicable disease at King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah. As the population of the study by Al-Ghamdi and Kabbash11 was limited to health workers, the scope of knowledge of preventive measures investigated was deeper compared with our study. Acknowledging the marked differences of questions used to measure level of knowledge of preventive public health measures in our study compared to the study by Al-Ghadmi and Kabbash,11 it might be possible to conduct an overall comparison of level of knowledge detected in both studies. When comparing the level of knowledge among the health workers recruited in our study compared with the findings of the study by Al-Ghadmi and Kabbash,11 it is possible to notice a similar range of variation in number of respondents who were knowledgeable of different preventive measures. The proportion of health workers who were aware of specific prevention measures in our study varied between 32-97%, which is similar to the findings of Al-Ghadmi and Kabbash11 where the proportion of health workers who were able to give correct answers regarding preventive measures ranged between 32-95%.",

Our study was able to detect multiple systematic flaws indicating organizational difficulties rather than individual incompetence. These difficulties can be summarized in few points. Firstly, there was a significant lack of a competent system to deliver health-related knowledge in a timely manner, especially in important events such as Hajj seasons. Secondly, since a substantial proportion of airport workers hired during Hajj seasons are recruited based on temporary contracts, those workers are very likely to be unaware of the airport facilities and health services providers. This notion was apparent when 40% of the respondents suggested the isolation of suspected travellers as a preventive measure despite the unavailability of this facility at the Prince Mohammed Airport. Thirdly, improper preparedness for a large event such as the Hajj season is evident from the lack of training before the season, as only 21% of the respondents revealed receiving any form of training before the Hajj season. Having detected several systematic flaws mandates, the need for future research concerning identification of barriers hindering proper provision of preventive public health services at the airport. Additionally, this investigation should be replicated in other points of entry, such as Prince Abdul-Aziz International Airport, and the Islamic Seaport in Jeddah, and other land crossings where pilgrims enter the country during Hajj season. Further investigations should include all workers who are in direct exposure to arriving pilgrims, and not limited to health workers only.",

A specific channel of knowledge sharing between the airport authority and airport workers should be initiated to enhance knowledge of the airport workers of the current public health concerns, and to provide theoretical and practical training pertaining to health protection at airport settings. Additionally, airport workers who are hired based on temporary contracts during Hajj season should be educated before joining the airport work force, and informed of the current situation of the airport health facilities and equipment needed for health protection.",

Insufficient numbers of staff will lead to an inability to apply preventive measures to thousands of pilgrims arriving at a single point in a limited time. Secondly, members of staff have to be specifically trained according to the current potential health threats at the airport. Thirdly, there has to be provision of preventive equipment, such as gloves, masks, thermal cameras, protective gowns, hand sanitizers, and ambulances to ensure the ability to apply preventive measures. Finally, necessary space is needed for the storing of relevant equipment, provision of preventive services, and isolation of suspected travellers, along with the provision of urgent curative services.15",

Conducting this study during the Hajj season is another strong point as information was collected when subjects were physically present at the point of entry. The limitations of this study were related to the small sample size and the refusal of security personnel to participate. Additionally, there might have been a possibility of measurement bias as respondents could have been hesitant to share critical views pertaining to provision of personal protective equipments (PPEs) and public health education. However, proper identification of the investigators, illustration of the study aims, ensuring anonymity, and taking notes as an alternative for audio recording might have reduced this measurement bias. Nevertheless, fear of being reported as complaining on the provided preventive health services was mostly apparent when approaching security personnel, which might have lead to a potential selection bias.",

The observed lower knowledge of non-health workers is mainly due to lack of appropriate knowledge sharing channels. Knowledge and training delivery channels should be established at the airport to ensure proper knowledge sharing and enhance preparedness levels. Enhancing the preparedness level during Hajj season is critical due to the large number of arrivals from all over the globe where several countries are endemic with known infectious diseases.",
