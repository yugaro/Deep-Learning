Although there are variations to the trial, participants typically complete the challenge (they are doused in ice water or make a donation) and nominate three others to undertake it.2 As of 1 September 2014, more than 17 million videos related to the Ice Bucket Challenge were shared on Facebook alone, and these were viewed more than 10 billion times by more than 440 million people.3 Socially viral phenomena include videos that are made popular by sharing on the internet, and a video is said to have gone viral if it spreads rapidly as a result of frequent sharing.4\n5 However, the infectious disease modelling framework has seldom been used to quantify the transmissibility of such socially viral phenomena.6 The most commonly used metric of transmissibility is the basic reproduction number (R0), defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a single index in a fully susceptible population.7 The value of R0 is a major determinant of the size of an epidemic, and an infection can only be self sustaining if R0 is greater than 1. The R0 also provides a measure of the effort required to control the epidemic.7\n8 We estimated the transmissibility of the Ice Bucket Challenge among globally influential celebrities and identified the associated risk factors.",

Two of the authors (MYN, BHYC) independently collected the data. After the fifth generation seeded from each index case they stopped data collection owing to investigator fatigue.

R0 was estimated as the product of the mean number of nominations (n) and the probability of successful nomination (p), assuming a branching process in which each participant of the Ice Bucket Challenge generates a random number of next generation participants. To account for the fact that the challenge had already taken off in early August 2014,15 we excluded nominees in the calculation of p who had previously completed the challenge (that is, were \u201cimmune\u201d from future participation) but included them in the calculation of n so that the estimated R0 would reflect the transmissibility in a fully \u201csusceptible\u201d population. We obtained 95% confidence intervals of the R0 estimate by bootstrap with 1000 replications. Mean serial interval was calculated by assuming at least a half day delay in accepting the challenge, based on all nominator-nominee pairs in our dataset. We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression to examine the association between number of successful nominations and personal factors (age, sex, occupation, and net worth) or popularity (number of likes on Facebook and number of followers on Twitter). To handle missing data we carried out sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation. All analyses were done using R version 3.0.2 and SAS university edition, 2014.",

In total we included 91 nominees up to the fifth generation seeded from each index case, and a total of 99 participants were enrolled into the cohort. Overall, 24.2% of participants had zero successful nominations, 32.3% had one, 26.3% had two, and 17.2% had three. Twelve (4.9%) out of the 247 nominations had already participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge and were therefore \u201cimmune\u201d from future participation. Among those observed were a Nobel laureate, a university vice chancellor, \u201cheart throbs\u201d, and Muppets (both the actors and the puppets). Among the index cases, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s nomination chain produced the most successful number of contacts (total of 41) up to the fifth generation (figure). No serious adverse events arising from the Ice Bucket Challenge act were observed in this series, but adverse events have been reported elsewhere,16 including falls, head injuries, a temporomandibular joint dislocation, cuts, and at least one fatality. We estimated the measure of transmissibility, R0, to be 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.65) and a mean serial interval of accepting the challenge of 2.1 days (median 1 day). We excluded Homer Simpson and Kermit the Frog in the regression models because of difficulty in ascertaining their personal characteristics. Participants with a higher log (base 10) net worth were more likely to spread the Ice Bucket challenge (odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.50), adjusted for age and sex. One unit change on a log (base 10) scale is equivalent to a 10-fold change in net worth. We tested the proportional odds assumption for the regression model and found no indication of violation. Age, sex, occupation, number of Facebook likes, or number of Twitter followers were not associated with transmissibility (table 2). Data were missing for 24.0% of net worth, 15.6% of Facebook likes, and 13.5% of Twitter followers. Sensitivity analysis by multiple imputation yielded similar results (not shown).",
