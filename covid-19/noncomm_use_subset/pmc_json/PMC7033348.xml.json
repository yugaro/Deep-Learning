Early cases of the disease have been linked to a live animal seafood market in Wuhan, pointing to a zoonotic origin of the epidemic. However, human-to-human transmission has driven its rapid spread with a total of 37,289 confirmed cases, including 813 deaths, in China and 302 confirmed cases imported in multiple countries as of February 9, 2020 (Chinese National Health Committee). While the early transmission potential of this novel coronavirus appeared similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Riou & Althaus, 2020), the current tally of the epidemic has already surpassed the total cases reported for the SARS outbreaks in 2002\u20132003 (W. World Health Organization, 2003; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).",

Consequently, the government rapidly built and launched two new hospitals with capacity for 1,600 and 1,000 beds, respectively, in Wuhan in addition to the existing 132 quarantine sites with more than 12,500 beds (Steinbuch, 2020). To anticipate additional resources to combat the epidemic, mathematical and statistical modeling tools can be useful to generate timely short-term forecasts of reported cases. These predictions can include estimates of expected morbidity burden that can help guide public health officials preparing the medical care and other resources needed to confront the epidemic. Short-term forecasts can also guide the intensity and type of interventions needed to mitigate an epidemic (Funk, Camacho, Kucharski, Eggo, & Edmunds, 2016; Shanafelt, Jones, Lima, Perrings, & Chowell, 2017). In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for 2019-nCoV, the effective implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing, will be critical to bring the epidemic under control.",

The generalized logistic growth model (GLM) extends the simple logistic growth model to accommodate sub-exponential growth dynamics with a scaling of growth parameter, p (Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2016). The Richards model also includes a scaling parameter, a, to allow for deviation from the symmetric logistic curve (Chowell, 2017; Richards, 1959; Wang et al., 2012). We also include a recently developed sub-epidemic wave model that supports complex epidemic trajectories, including multiple peaks (i.e., SARS in Singapore (Chowell et al., 2019)). In this approach, the observed reported curve is assumed to be the aggregate of multiple underlying sub-epidemics (Chowell et al., 2019).

These models predict that the epidemic has reached a saturation point for both Hubei and other provinces. This likely reflects the impact of the wide spectrum of social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government, which likely helped stabilize the epidemic. The forecasts presented are based on the assumption that current mitigation efforts will continue.",
