Moreover, whereas superspreading events have been documented for outbreaks of MERS and other emerging diseases,4\n14 it is essential to identify the factors and mechanisms behind superspreading events in order to guide countermeasures in anticipation of potential future outbreaks. For instance, in addition to close contacts within households and healthcare facilities (that are, in the present study, defined as \u2018social\u2019 or \u2018behavioural\u2019 factors that characterise the elevated risk of secondary transmissions), certain aerosol producing procedures, for example, nebuliser treatments, emergency intubations and a ventilation system, as well as delayed diagnosis, have been identified as major factors giving rise to superspreading events of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).15\u201317 Such factors during medical treatment should be defined as \u2018procedural\u2019 or \u2018mechanical\u2019 factors that have the potential to generate superspreading events. Other than social/behavioural and procedural/mechanical, it is possible that \u2018biological\u2019 or \u2018intrinsic\u2019 factors such as specific immune reactions that allow the virus to be viable for longer periods of time or increased viral load among certain infected individuals, could play a role in generating superspreaders. While superspreaders may not easily be fully classified in one of abovementioned categories, it is vital to identify common features of those producing secondary cases. The present study aims to analyse the time-dependent and host type-specific characteristics of MERS-CoV transmission in the Republic of Korea, using epidemic modelling, thereby epidemiologically exploring mechanisms of heterogeneous transmission.",

Thus, while trusting the observed transmission network, we have also deterministically reconstructed a part of the untraced transmission network using the serial interval, that is, the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in the secondary case who has directly acquired infection from the primary case. An analysis of epidemiological data in South Korea estimated the mean and SD of the serial interval at 12.6 and 2.8 days, respectively.2 Based on the information of shared healthcare facility and using the probability density function of the serial interval, g(s), of length s, which was assumed to follow a gamma distribution, each pair of cases without known link but with known dates of illness onset t1 and t2 (for t1<t2), was deterministically connected identifying the pair that yields the highest probability of connection given by g(t2\u2212t1). During the reconstruction, the observed network was trusted and dealt with as the subset of reconstructed network, and the most likely source of infection among secondary cases without incoming link but with known date of illness onset t2 was explored. There were no multiple pairs of cases that yielded an identically highest probability, and, thus, the abovementioned rule of deterministic reconstruction was not violated. Due to the reconstruction, two offspring distributions, namely, the distribution of secondary cases per single primary case, were obtained, for the observed network only and for a partially reconstructed (\u2018modelled\u2019) network.",

Based on the percentile (eg, 95 centile) and visual inspection of the offspring distribution, superspreaders in the present study were defined as those causing eight or more secondary cases. Specifically, the type-specific transmission dynamics were examined, classifying diagnosed cases into two or more types according to their occupation (healthcare workers vs others), hospital admission status (inpatients or outpatients vs others) and contact behaviour (visiting multiple healthcare facilities vs others), so that specific characteristics of primary cases who frequently produced secondary cases could be identified. Patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities were defined as confirmed cases who experienced exposures at two or more facilities shortly before and after the date of illness onset. In addition, any statistical association was explored between superspreader and time delays, from illness onset to diagnosis and from illness onset to hospital admission. Presence of secondary transmission and being a superspreader was dichotomised, so that the association of these two features with dichotomous types of cases (eg, visiting multiple healthcare facilities) was examined using \u03c72 test. The association between secondary transmission/superspreader and time delays was examined using t tests.",

When analysing type-specific patterns of transmission, having visited multiple healthcare facilities was a common feature of the superspreaders and those causing secondary transmission during the outbreak. Through our analysis based on the multitype branching process model, it was shown that superspreaders who visited multiple facilities drove the epidemic by generating a disproportionate number of secondary cases. Examining the time-dependent dynamics, it was shown that the majority of secondary transmissions were caused by the superspreaders, and the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number originating from non-superspreaders remained below 1. The reproduction numbers declined as a function of time, and were substantially below the value of 1 on and after 13 June 2015.

In fact, while it is well known that the offspring distribution is overdispersed,10\n11 biological mechanisms behind both social/behavioural and biological/intrinsic factors, for example, increased virus replications, high frequency/dose of pathogen shedding, or some other unknown host-pathogen relationship, which may be completely different in superspreaders than in all others, have yet to be identified. It is worth noting that a recent study isolated MERS-CoV from a variety of environmental samples within two hospitals.28 Second, the number of cases was limited, and, thus, we employed a piecewise constant model for estimating the time-dependent reproduction numbers, while the determination of time intervals might not have been fully objective. Third, we had to deal with missing information that we substituted or discarded. As noted in the Methods section, the illness onset date was not fully available. Fourth, our reconstruction of the transmission tree has yet to be validated. Evolutionary genomic data can shed light on this validation task. For instance, strain-specific variations in spike glycoprotein genes of MERS-CoV during the outbreak have been detected.29",

Overall, our findings highlight the importance of setting up systems that support infection control measures via triage and care of suspected cases in order to limit unnecessary contacts caused by patients with non-specific respiratory symptoms.30\n31 Contact tracing that leads to early laboratory testing and diagnosis would be the core component of countermeasures against MERS in order to minimise unnecessary contacts that could turn into superspreading events.32\u201334 Considering the recent increase in human-to-human transmission events of MERS-CoV, it is vital to build up and intensify coordinated research on MERS-CoV, so that social and biological mechanisms that generate superspreaders and superspreading events can be fully characterised.",
