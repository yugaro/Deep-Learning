The estimated worldwide incidence of severe pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age is 50\u201380 per 1,000 person-years and the mortality is 1.0\u20135.5 per 1,000 person-years (3\u20135). It often occurs in the winter and spring, with acute onset, complex clinical manifestations and fast-changing condition, which usually involves the circulation, nervous and digestive systems (1\u20133). As a result, severe pneumonia produces corresponding clinical symptoms, such as respiratory failure, heart failure, toxic encephalopathy and intestinal paralysis, which endanger the lives of children in the short term, and is the first cause of death of pediatric inpatients (6,7). It is listed as the one of the four diseases requiring prevention and treatment in children by the Ministry of Health (8,9).",

Side effects of various drugs were observed, and if children patients showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. In our study, close observation of consciousness, pupil changes and muscle tension was carried out, and if manifestations of intracranial pressure such as drowsiness, convulsions, irregular breathing and increased muscle tension appeared, immediate rescue steps were taken.

Under normal conditions, the children were placed in a horizontal position, with neck raised high, in order that airways would be unblocked. For children patients with severe heart failure and wheezing, semi-recumbent position was taken to reduce the burden on the heart and lungs (29,30). For children patients with increased respiratory secretions, the lateral position was useful to expectorate and prevent aspiration. ii) Patients received daily routine aerosol inhalation, turning drugs into aerialfog-like fine particles, inhaled to the bronchioles or alveoli, which diluted secretions and had an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic function and reduced local inflammatory exudates, in addition to reducing airway resistance and improving ventilation. Aerosol inhalation time was 10\u201315 min and afterwards sputum suction was carried out immediately in order to clear respiratory secretions. Commonly used drugs included: 20,000 units of gentamicin, 2\u20133 mg of \u03b1-chymotrypsin, 1\u20132 mg of dexamethasone, and 20 ml of saline. The dual role of the aforementioned ultrasonic aerosol inhalation was useful to reinforce treatment of children with severe pneumonia. According to the disease, aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing, which produced a good suction effect for children patients with many sticky respiratory secretions. It should be noted that if patients had excessive sputum, the sputum suction was also carried out once prior to using ultrasound aerosol inhalation therapy, followed by thorough sputum suction. In the whole process of aerosol inhalation, providing oxygen inhalation or enhancing oxygen concentration effectively prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia (31). iii) Hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus, which causes obstruction and sudden suffocation. First, the child patient's tongue tip was pulled outside the mouth, and then artificial respiration was conducted, with most patients being able to relieve themselves spontaneously. Pressurized oxygen was given, endotracheal intubation was carried out if necessary and calcium was replenished immediately. iv) When nasal obstruction caused breathing difficulties, 1% ephedrine drops were used after clearing away nasal secretions with a cotton swab, to maintain the airway patency. v) The diet of children with severe pneumonia was affected due to high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and other factors. When children patients were unable to eat, it was appropriate to supplement water, electrolytes, vitamins, and give them high-calorie, high protein, digestible food, that was eaten in small amounts but frequently, to prevent satiety from interfering with respiratory function. vi) Previous findings showed that, ambroxol and low-dose heparin coupled with aerosol inhalation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs and improved overall efficiency of the clinical treatment (32,33). There was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process, which had advantages such as easy administration, safe use, inexpensiveness, a significant effect, and less adverse effects in the treatment of children with severe pneumonia, and was thus worthy of wider application.",

For severe pneumonia, NCPAP can support cardiopulmonary function, and its early application can improve timely oxygenation, stabilize disease, prevent disease progression, reduce ventilator application and average hospitalization time in pediatric intensive care unit as well as avoid the adverse effects caused by intubation (34). However, two points are important when applying it to infants: i) grasp indications and standard of respiratory failure that the children comply with; ii) over NCPAP application process, nasal and oral secretions should be immediately removed, raising the neck high, to strengthen expectoration in order to maintain airway patency. Operating parameters of using the NCPAP oxygen therapy machine in our department: i) Oxygen concentration inhaled (FiO2) 40 or 90%; ii) the oxygen flow 4\u201312 l/min; and iii) the beginning pressure was maintained at 3\u20134 cm H2O. After observing 2\u20134 h, the adjustment of pressure was determined by clinical symptoms, signs and blood gas analysis. NCPAP is an effective treatment for severe pneumonia with respiratory and heart failure, and can quickly correct hypoxemia, reduce endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation demand (35). It has a positive effect and can reduce the stimulation of children, thus decreasing any occurrence of ventilator pneumonia. In addition, parents readily accepted this treatment (36).",

The above, as well as cold extremities and weak pulse, constituted clinical manifestations of a heart failure. In this situation, oxygen inhalation and tranquilizers were given immediately, 0.5 \u00b5g/(kg \u00d7 min) and milrinone, a second generation of phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III) inhibitor, which acts on the \u03b2 receptor accessory pathway, was administered to maintain heart function. By selectively inhibiting PDE-III in myocardial cells, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, promoting calcium influx, enhancing calcium concentration in myocardial cytolymph, milrinone strengthens myocardial contractility, increases cardiac output, and exerts direct relaxation on vascular smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels and reduces cardiac preload and afterload. Milrinone demonstrates a better clinical efficacy in the treatment of children with pneumonia complicated by heart failure than catecholamines (37).",

There were sufficient data displaying that the inappropriate choice of anti-infective drugs for initial therapy and untimely appropriate treatment (effective therapy of antigens) had adverse consequences on the prognosis. The main indicators of efficacy were a decrease in body temperature, improvement in poisoning symptoms and ability to drink water or conduct breast-feeding or food intake.
