            "text": "Influenza is a febrile respiratory disease of medical and economic importance in humans. The infectious agent of this disease, influenza A virus (IAV), is one of the best-studied viral pathogens. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the infectious cycle remain elusive. IAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, and it has a segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome (1). The replication cycle of IAV starts with binding of the virus via its glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), a glycosylation motif on membrane proteins at the surface of the airway epithelium (2). Attachment to target cells is followed by internalization via clathrin- and non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis (3\u20135). Internalized particles are transported along the endosomal pathway, a complex cellular machinery, that mediates the turnover of early endosomes to late endosomes by fusion with lysosomal vesicles or proton influx and acidification (6, 7). IAV exploits the acidification of endosomes and fuses at low pH with the endosomal membrane (8, 9). This fusion of viral and endosomal membranes allows the delivery of viral genomes in the form of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) to the cytoplasm and their subsequent transport into the nucleus, the site of IAV genome replication (10, 11). While the functions of the viral proteins in the entry process are thought to be well understood, much less is known about the cellular proteins involved. However, such cellular factors could potentially be exploited as drug targets for host-directed antiviral therapy if they play a crucial role in IAV entry (12, 13). In order to reveal cellular factors required for IAV, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens have been performed (14\u201318). These screens have provided us with hundreds of candidate factors, but to date, only a few follow-up studies have been done.",

            "text": "In this study, we analyze the role of cathepsin W (CtsW) for IAV replication, since CtsW was discovered to be a required factor for IAV, and it has been suggested that CtsW is involved in IAV entry into cells in one of the RNAi screens (15). Cathepsins are cysteine proteases of the papain superfamily that are involved in numerous cellular functions, such as regulation of apoptosis or establishment of inflammatory processes (19). CtsW, together with cathepsin F, belongs to a relatively new subgroup of F-like cathepsins which is distinct from the well-studied cathepsin B- and L-like subgroups (20). Cathepsins B and L were shown to be required for Ebola virus entry by cleaving the viral glycoprotein in the endosomal compartment (21). Moreover, inhibition of cathepsin L also resulted in inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection (22, 23), whereas cathepsin B has been implicated in entry of Nipah virus (24). In contrast to cathepsins B and L, nothing is known about the possible function of CtsW in viral infections. While cathepsins B and L are lysosomal enzymes, CtsW was found to localize predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in HeLa, COS-7, and natural killer (NK) cells (25, 26). Its high expression in CD8+ T cells and NK cells and its upregulation by interleukin 2 (IL-2) also distinguish CtsW from the other members of the family (25). It was observed that CtsW is not needed for the effector function of these cells (26), so the question of the function of CtsW remains unanswered.",

In order to confirm and extend these findings, we analyzed the impact of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated CtsW knockdown on viral growth of IAV strain A/WSN/33 at different times postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A). Depletion of CtsW using two different siRNAs (siCtsW #2 and siCtsW #3) was found to reduce titers of A/WSN/33 up to 100-fold compared to cells transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA (siSCR). Cells treated with siRNAs targeting either a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (siVATPase) or the viral nucleoprotein (siNP) showed an almost complete block of replication. siCtsW-mediated reduction of viral titers was not limited to A549 cells, as we observed similar effects in Wi38 lung fibroblast cells (Fig. 1B). To check whether siCtsW treatment leads to a reduction in viral titers for multiple IAV strains, we performed infection experiments in siRNA-treated A549 cells with the highly pathogenic avian strain A/FPV/Dobson/34 (H7N7) and the human strain A/Hongkong/68 (H3N2) (Fig. 1C and D). Both viral strains showed a significant decrease in viral replication at all time points tested. To assess whether the observed inhibition was specific to IAV, we analyzed the impact of CtsW knockdown on replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). siCtsW treatment did not lead to a significant reduction in VSV titers at 18 h p.i. (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the requirement of CtsW is specific for IAV but independent of the cell line and IAV strain.",

Using an immunofluorescence-based read-out, we measured the amount of NP within cell nuclei of siRNA-transfected A549 cells at early time points of infection. At 48 h after siRNA transfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and 3 h p.i. NP was stained and analyzed by confocal microscopy. In control cells treated with siSCR, cell nuclei showed a clear signal of NP, whereas cells treated with siCtsW or the siVATPase control showed a drastic reduction in nuclear NP (Fig. 2A). To exclude off-target effects, we repeated this experiment using six different siRNAs targeting CtsW. For each of the siRNAs, the NP signal at 3 h p.i. within cell nuclei (n > 200) was quantified, and we observed a strong decrease compared to siSCR-treated cells (Fig. 2B). All six siRNAs reduced the plasmid-based expression of CtsW substantially (Fig. 2C), suggesting that all of them are able to reduce endogenous levels of CtsW below optimal amounts for IAV. In addition, no impact on cell viability was observed for any of the siRNAs targeting CtsW (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that CtsW is required for an early step during the IAV replication cycle.",

Flow cytometric analysis of membrane-bound virus revealed no difference in the percentage of Cy3-positive (Cy3+) cells between siSCR- or siCtsW-treated cells (Fig. 3A, samples labeled 0 min), indicating that viral attachment is not affected by CtsW knockdown.

Between 15 and 180 min p.i., no difference in colocalization of NP with the early endosomal marker was observed in siSCR- or siCtsW-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Within the first 45 min p.i., a rapid increase in colocalization of NP and EEA1 was detected, and then colocalization declined, indicating a transient presence of viral particles within the early endosomal compartment. Representative images from the 45-min time point illustrate the observed colocalization in both siSCR- and siCtsW-treated cells (Fig. 3C; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).

We generated a dual-labeled virus, which allowed us to measure fusion in a quantitative manner. IAV particles were labeled with two different dyes, one dye (R18 [octadecyl rhodamine B chloride] red) quenching the fluorescence of the other dye {DiOC [3,3\u2032-dioctadecyl-5,5\u2032-di(4-sulfophenyl)oxacarbocyanine] green}. If membrane fusion occurs, DiOC and R18 diffuse into the endosomal membrane, and quenching is no longer possible, which enables the detection of DiOC fluorescence. We infected siRNA-transfected A549 cells that were either pretreated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or with bafilomycin A1, a known inhibitor of endosomal acidification and viral fusion. We synchronized infection by adding the virus in an initial 30-min cold binding step after which the temperature was shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow viral entry and fusion. At 90 min or 180 min p.i., cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy, and fusion sites were visible as bright green spots of DiOC fluorescence. These fusion sites (white arrowheads in Fig. 4A) were predominantly visible in siSCR-transfected control cells that were pretreated with DMSO. Both siCtsW- and siVATPase-transfected cells displayed fewer fusion sites as shown in representative images (Fig. 4A). We quantified the number of fusion sites using the spot detection algorithm of ImageJ and normalized to the number of cell nuclei (Fig. 4B). We observed two to six fusion sites per cell at 90 to 180 min p.i. in siSCR-transfected cells pretreated with DMSO. In contrast, no fusion sites were detected in siSCR-transfected cells pretreated with bafilomycin A1. Also, in siCtsW- and siVATPase-transfected cells, no or only a few fusion sites were observed, independent of their pretreatment with DMSO or bafilomycin A1. This indicates that knockdown of CtsW results in inhibition of viral and endosomal membrane fusion.",

Although previous studies reported ER localization of CtsW (26, 28, 29), its production as an inactive precursor in the ER could mask its presence in other compartments. First, we analyzed the localization of CtsW by costaining of CtsW and the ER-resident chaperone calnexin in A549 cells stably expressing CtsW. As expected, a large amount of CtsW colocalized with the ER marker (Fig. 4C, top panel). Unfortunately, we were not able to costain for CtsW and the late endosomal marker LBPA, as both antibodies are derived from mice. We therefore costained for LAMP1 as a marker for late endosomes and observed a considerable amount of colocalization (Fig. 4C, bottom panels). Thus, in A549 cells, CtsW localizes to the ER but also at least partially to late endosomes where it could function to enable IAV fusion.",

To this aim, we treated siRNA-transfected A549 cells with lysotracker (LY), a dye that stains acidic compartments red fluorescent. As expected, cells treated with the VATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 did not display any lysotracker signal (Fig. 5A, bottom row). Cells transfected with siCtsW still displayed strong lysotracker staining that was indistinguishable from control cells (Fig. 5A, top row), suggesting that knockdown of CtsW does not drastically alter endosomal pH and thereby inhibit fusion. However, it is still possible that minor changes in pH that are not detectable with the lysotracker dye could contribute to the observed effects. We therefore tested the impact of CtsW knockdown on a strain of IAV, A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963, that has recently been shown to have a higher pH fusion optimum of pH 5.5 to 5.6 compared to pH 5.2 for A/WSN/33 (30). If reduced levels of CtsW resulted in slightly increased endosomal pH, this virus strain should display reduced sensitivity to knockdown of CtsW. We transfected A549 cells with control or CtsW-targeting siRNAs, infected the cells with virus at an MOI of 10, and quantified nuclear NP. We observed that A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963 replicated more slowly than A/WSN/33 did and that nuclear NP was detected only from 5 h p.i. onwards (data not shown). We therefore chose the 5-h time point to quantify nuclear NP. Similar to the results obtained with A/WSN/33, we detected a strong reduction in nuclear NP accumulation upon knockdown of CtsW (Fig. 5B; see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). Next, we tested the impact of CtsW knockdown on lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which also fuses in acidic compartments (31). Cells transfected with the control siSCR displayed robust viral replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 5C and Fig. S1B), whereas lower levels of viral NP were detected in cells transfected with siVATPase. In cells transfected with two siRNAs targeting CtsW, we could not detect any significant changes in the cytoplasmic replication of LCMV, and therefore, we conclude that, although LCMV is a late fusing virus, it is not dependent on CtsW for fusion. These data suggest that CtsW does not impact endosomal pH, yet it is required for viral and endosomal fusion of IAV but not LCMV.",

Since all previous experiments were performed with stocks of IAV that were grown in the presence of trypsin and thus contained HA1 and HA2 but no or negligible levels of HA0 (Fig. 5D), we did not expect to find a role for CtsW in cleavage of HA0 to HA1/HA2. However, additional cleavage events of hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) could be possible. We infected A549 control cells or A549 cells overexpressing CtsW with A/WSN/33 (MOI of 50) for 1 h or 2 h. Cell lysates were prepared and tested for viral protein levels and for CtsW expression. Since we mapped the target step of CtsW to an event at or just before fusion in the late endosome, we did not expect NP or M1 matrix protein to be proteolytically processed by CtsW. Indeed, the levels of M1 and NP were unchanged upon overexpression of CtsW, and no lower-molecular-mass bands were observed (Fig. 5E; see Fig. S2C in the supplemental material). Interestingly, we also found similar levels of the two viral surface glycoproteins HA and NA (Fig. 5E and Fig. S2C), and we could not detect any cleavage products with a lower molecular mass for either protein. Thus, we assume that no CtsW-dependent cleavage of viral surface glycoproteins takes place.",

            "text": "To test whether its catalytic activity as cysteine protease is required for the function of CtsW in IAV entry, we generated an enzymatically inactive mutant of CtsW, CtsW(C153A), by replacing cysteine at position 153, which is part of the catalytic triad by alanine. In addition, we introduced three silent mutations to achieve resistance to one of our siRNAs (CtsW #2) into both the wild-type CtsW- and CtsW(C153A)-encoding constructs. Both constructs were cloned into a lentiviral vector and used to generate stable cell lines expressing either CtsW (CtsW_res #2) or CtsW(C153A) (C153A_res #2). In addition, A549 cells were transduced with a lentivirus carrying no insert (control cells). To validate the cell lines, they were transfected with either siRNAs targeting CtsW or control siSCR, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for CtsW expression. As described above, endogenous levels of CtsW were not detected. In contrast, both cell lines transduced to express either wild-type CtsW or CtsW(C153A) showed robust expression of CtsW when transfected with siSCR or siCtsW #2 against which both constructs were made resistant (Fig. 6A). As expected, siCtsW #3 was still able to reduce CtsW levels below the limit of detection in Western blots, validating the generated cell lines. In addition, we also assessed growth of IAV in the cell lines overexpressing either wild-type or mutant CtsW and found no difference in IAV replication (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Next, we made use of the cell lines to assess whether the catalytic activity of CtsW was required for its function in IAV entry. After transfection of CtsW-targeting or control siRNAs, we infected these cells with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 10. After an initial cold binding step, we allowed infection to proceed for 3 h at 37\u00b0C before we stained for IAV NP and measured the NP signal within the nuclei of infected cells. All three cell lines transfected with siSCR showed a clear NP signal in the nucleus at 3 h p.i. (Fig. 6B). As expected, the nuclear NP signal was strongly reduced in control cells upon knockdown of CtsW with either of the two siRNAs (Fig. 6B, top row). In contrast, CtsW_res #2 cells transfected with siCtsW #2 displayed a significantly higher NP signal due to the overexpression of siRNA-resistant CtsW. This effect was specific to siCtsW #2; transfection of siCtsW #3 still resulted in a strongly reduced nuclear NP signal (Fig. 6B, middle row). We could not observe a rescue of infection in the siCtsW #2-transfected cells when the cells were overexpressing catalytically inactive CtsW (Fig. 6B, bottom row). In addition, we transfected the cell lines with an siRNA targeting the VATPase subunit. Transduced cells, transfected with this siRNA, did not show any infection which shows that the observed rescue of infection is specific to CtsW knockdown. To verify these findings, we quantified the amounts of nuclear NP using ImageJ software. For siCtsW #2, rescue of infection by wild-type CtsW was highly significant compared to control cells, but expression of the inactive mutant did not increase the levels of nuclear NP significantly (Fig. 6C).",

We hypothesized that this could be the reason for the incomplete rescue of infection by wild-type CtsW. Indeed, when we repeated the experiment but stained for CtsW and NP in parallel and quantified only nuclear NP from CtsW-positive cells, we observed an almost complete rescue of nuclear NP (Fig. 6D). Taken together, overexpression of CtsW can rescue the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of CtsW, showing that the observed impact on IAV entry is caused by depletion of CtsW levels rather than off-target effects of the siRNA. Moreover, the proteolytic activity of CtsW is required for its role in escape of IAV from late endosomes.",

Moreover, such required cellular proteins represent potential drug targets, as shown by K\u00f6nig et al. (15) and Stertz and Shaw (34). However, to date, there has been little follow-up on the identified factors, and so far, no promising drug target has emerged from the screens. In this study, we characterized CtsW, one of the hits identified in a genome-wide RNAi screen, and show that CtsW is required for fusion of influenza virus with the endosomal membrane and subsequent escape of IAV into the cytoplasm. The proviral function of CtsW required its catalytic activity, and therefore, we suggest that CtsW could be a potential drug target worth exploring for the development of novel antiviral agents.",

Finer mapping of the target step revealed that virus attachment, internalization, and early endosomal trafficking were not affected. However, escape of IAV from the late endosome was blocked, and viral fusion was strongly inhibited upon CtsW knockdown (Fig. 3 and 4). We therefore conclude that CtsW is required for fusion or a step just before the fusion event. While we have a detailed understanding of the functions of the viral proteins in the fusion event (9), little is known about the cellular players involved. Early on, it was observed that low pH is required for fusion and that the endosomal VATPase complex is needed to provide the low-pH environment in the endosome (8, 35, 36). Recently, the tetraspanin CD81 was identified as a second cellular player in the fusion process, but so far, we do not understand how CD81 exerts its function (37). With this study, we have identified a novel player in the fusion process, CtsW.",

This is consistent with previous findings, which reported ER localization of CtsW (26, 28, 29). Interestingly, we also detected colocalization with a late endosomal marker (Fig. 4), and we therefore assume that at least a fraction of CtsW localizes to late endosomes. This would be consistent with a function of CtsW before or during the viral fusion process which takes place in the late endosome.",

            "text": "Notably, we detected two easily separable bands for CtsW on Western blots; the top band could sometimes be observed as a doublet. In contrast, only a single band could be detected for the catalytically inactive mutant. Thus far, we can only speculate that the additional bands represent modified forms, as this will require further studies. From results obtained with the catalytically inactive mutant (Fig. 6), we hypothesize that CtsW cleaves a yet unknown target in the late endosome and that this proteolytic cleavage event is important for fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. This proteolytic cleavage event does not seem to impact endosomal pH. First, knockdown of CtsW did not result in detectable changes of the lysotracker signal, which marks acidic organelles (Fig. 5) (38). Second, a strain of IAV that had been shown to have a higher pH optimum for fusion (pH 5.5 to 5.6 versus pH 5.2 for A/WSN/33) was inhibited by knockdown of CtsW to an extent similar to that of strain A/WSN/33 (Fig. 5) (30). Instead, we hypothesize that the low pH is rather a requirement for CtsW function, as shown for other cathepsin family members (39, 40). The substrate that is cleaved by CtsW and then enables fusion to occur has yet to be identified. As we used trypsin-treated virus stocks for all experiments, we did not expect to find a role for CtsW in HA cleavage from HA0 to HA1 and HA2. Moreover, strain A/FPV/Dobson/34 which contains a multibasic cleavage site in its HA protein was also sensitive to CtsW knockdown (Fig. 1). Therefore, we speculated that additional cleavage events could occur in HA or NA, but our experiments aiming to detect such cleavage events during the early stages of viral entry did not show any differences between control cells and cells overexpressing CtsW (Fig. 5). This could be indicative of cellular proteins being cleaved or degraded by CtsW, rather than viral proteins. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a small fraction of a viral protein is targeted by CtsW but not detected by our Western blot setting.",
