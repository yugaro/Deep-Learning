In particular, there is a lack of data on molecular targets, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics (PKs, mainly focused on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion [ADME]), and toxicology for most natural products.2,3 On the other hand, many of the natural products have the ability to regulate important drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and P-glycoprotein. This has raised a safety concern regarding the use of natural products due to their modulatory effect on the activity and expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, resulting in potentially harmful drug interactions and eventually adverse drug reactions.4",

Numerous compounds have been isolated from marine organisms, with a wide range of pharmacological activity, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects.17\u201318 Xyloketal B (XKB, Figure 1) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., and has potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects.19,20 We have found that XKB has a relaxing effect on blood vessels and protects endothelial cells against oxidative injury induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.10 It directly scavenged the free radical-generating compound 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and protected PC12 cells against oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation injury.9 Further, it has a strong inhibitory effect on the L-calcium channel.21 The potent antioxidative effect of XKB suggests that it is a promising agent in the treatment of oxidative stress-associated conditions, such as CVD. To establish the dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships of XKB, we investigated its metabolism and PKs in rats. In vivo, the plasma PKs of XKB followed a two-compartment model with a distribution phase and an elimination phase.22 XKB showed a short elimination half-life (22\u201327 minutes), suggesting that it was rapidly distributed in the body and also rapidly eliminated. However, the molecular targets in response to XKB treatment and the effect of XKB on regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown.",

We aligned the rat Cyp3a2 sequence based on the template of human CYP3A4. Following the establishment of this homology model, both the human CYP3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology models were cleaned, modified, and prepared. For the preparation for XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol, the duplicate chemical structures were deleted and ionization change, tautomer or isomer generation, Lipinski filter, and three-dimensional generator were all set true. After ligand preparation, XKB, midazolam, ketoconazole, and probucol were docked into the active sites of the human CYP3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model.

Briefly, rat liver microsomes (10 mg) were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes then centrifuged at 9,000\u00d7 g for 3 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein samples were resolved in 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for one hour with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 buffer, followed by incubation overnight with their respective primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then washed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 buffer and incubated with secondary antibody for one hour at 37\u00b0C. Signals were detected using the Clarity Western ECL substrate and Bio-Rad imaging system. Quantification was performed using the ImageJ Analyzer 4.0 software Media (Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). The relative expression level of Cyp3a2 in rat liver microsomes was expressed as the ratio of the intensity of Cyp3a2 blots to that of GAPDH.",

Successive oral administration of XKB was scheduled using midazolam as a probe drug. Midazolam is a well-known probe substrate for human CYP3A4/5, but it is unclear if it is an appropriate probe for determining rat Cyp3a activity in vivo. The major metabolite of midazolam in humans is 1\u2032-OH-MDZ.42 The mean plasma profiles of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ after 8 consecutive days of treatment with XKB are shown for each group in Figures 5 and 6. The associated PK parameters are listed in Tables 9\u201311. The results indicate there were significant changes in the PK parameters of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ in rats treated with XKB for 8 days. In comparison with vehicle-treated rats, treatment with 14 mg/kg XKB increased the Cmax, AUC0\u2013t, AUC0\u2013inf, and AUMC of midazolam by 2.9-fold, 2.7-fold, 2.6-fold, and 2.0-fold, respectively (P<0.05). In contrast, the CL/F and V/F of midazolam were decreased by 63.0% and 84.0% in rats treated with 14 mg/kg XKB, respectively, compared with rats receiving vehicle only. The ka, ke, t1/2ka, t1/2ke, Tmax, and mean residence time for midazolam remained unchanged after rats were given 14 mg/kg XKB orally for 8 days. Our data also show that oral administration of XKB at 7 mg/kg significantly changed the AUC0\u2013t of midazolam, with a 1.4-fold increase. For 1\u2032-OH-MDZ, oral administration of XKB 7 mg/kg significantly increased AUC0\u2013t, AUC0\u2013inf, and AUMC by 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, and 1.9-fold, respectively, when compared with the control rats treated with vehicle only. Similarly, there was a 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, and 2-fold increase in AUC0\u2013t, AUC0\u2013inf, and AUMC, respectively, in rats treated with XKB 14 mg/kg for 8 days when compared with control rats. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, the ratio of plasma AUC for 1\u2032-OH-MDZ over that of midazolam was significantly decreased by 42.6% in rats treated orally with XKB 14 mg/kg. However, treatment of XKB at either dose did not change the CL/F and V/F of midazolam or 1\u2032-OH-MDZ in rats.",

In the present study, we predicted over 324 molecular targets and 61 related signaling pathways regulated by XKB.

Our findings show that XKB can modulate a number of functional proteins and related signaling pathways. These proteins and signaling pathways have important roles in the regulation of redox homeostasis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, energy metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and the inflammatory response. Interestingly, XKB shared a number of molecular targets with probucol, which was initially developed as an antihyperlipidemic drug for the treatment of coronary artery diseases but was removed from the USA market in 1995 after it was found to prolong the QT interval.33,43 The overlapped molecular targets suggest that XKB can regulate the same targets and signaling pathways as probucol. Probucol has been reported to lower cholesterol levels in the blood by increasing the rate of low-density lipoprotein catabolism, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and delaying cholesterol absorption.44 It is also a potent antioxidant that suppresses the oxidation of cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins. The cholesterol efflux regulatory protein ABCA1 is considered its main target.45 As a natural marine compound, XKB may be a promising agent for the treatment of CVD when its potential cardiovascular side effects can be minimized or avoided.",

The rat Cyp3a2 homology model was built based on human CYP3A4 (PDB ID 4K9W). Our data show that the rat Cyp3a2 homology model shared 83.3% sequence similarity and 68.4% identity with human CYP3A4. It has been reported that rat Cyp3a2 exhibits a 73% homology amino acid sequence to human CYP3A4.48 This difference may affect the interaction between XKB and rat Cyp3a2. Indeed, our findings show that XKB interacted with the rat Cyp3a2 homology model via hydrogen bond formation at Ala482 located in the active site of the enzyme. However, there was no interaction between XKB and human CYP3A4 Ala482 located in the active site, but Gly481. Collectively, our modeling study shows that XKB can act as a substrate and/or inhibitor for both rat Cyp3a2 and human CYP3A4. However, when we extrapolate these results to humans, we should bear in mind that Cyp3a2 and CYP3A4 share a certain degree of sequence similarity identity, so functional validation is always needed.",

It has been widely used to examine the degree of drug interaction and inhibitory effect of xenobiotics on the activity and function of CYP3A4/5 via evaluation of urinary and/or plasma levels of midazolam and its main metabolite 1\u2032-OH-MDZ.49,50 In our study, plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ were determined using a validated HPLC method with a high specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery rate for midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ, and the tested samples showed high stability. This indicates that the HPLC method is reliable for determining the plasma concentration of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ. Our present findings show that oral administration of XKB 14 kg/mg for 8 days significantly elevated the AUC0\u2013t and Cmax of midazolam, but decreased its CL/F. XKB also showed an inhibitory effect on the metabolism of midazolam similar to that seen with ketoconazole in vivo. However, there were not remarkable changes in the ka, ke, t1/2ka, t1/2ke, and V/F of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ in rats treated with XKB. Collectively, the data strongly suggest that XKB decreased Cyp3a-mediated metabolism and clearance of midazolam in rats. Notably, it has been reported that midazolam has inducing effects on expression of Cyp3a1 and Cyp2b in rat hepatocytes,51 which in turn may affect its own metabolism and that of other Cyp3a substrate drugs.",

It has been reported that protein degradation is an important regulator of CYP turnover at the post-translational level.52 In our study, we predicted that XKB might target ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 7 and 14 (USP7 and USP14), which play important roles in protein degradation. XKB might regulate ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to downregulate the content of rat hepatic Cyp3a2. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, microRNAs are the major determinants of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, suppressing gene expression by mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition.53,54 Moreover, it has been reported that the expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a2 is predisposed to regulation by nuclear transcription factors or nuclear receptors,55\u201357 which may also be involved in the regulatory effect of XKB on expression of rat Cyp3a2.",

For example, XKB may have profound therapeutic effects due to interactions with its potential multiple targets; however, a multitargeted agent may also result in side effects due to unwanted binding with toxicity-associated targets (eg, hERG). The potential interactions between XKB and CYP3A4/Cyp3a2 may lead to unfavorable drug interactions. In addition, the short elimination half-life of XKB may negatively affect its concentration at the site of action and compromise the therapeutic effect in clinical practice. Therefore, these findings provide clues for further XKB-based drug development and clinical use, including structural modification or nanotechnology-based formulations to minimize or avoid its potential side effects and prolong its elimination half-life to achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of action.",
