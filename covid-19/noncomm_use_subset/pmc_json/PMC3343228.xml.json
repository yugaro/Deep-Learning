Knowledge of viral hosts enables the identification of maintenance populations from which epidemics may emerge1,2,3,4. From an ecological perspective, the natural host of a given virus may be regarded as its habitat5,6. Unfortunately, unbiased assessment of habitat is impossible, as it requires the investigation of all host species in all possible geographical locations. Moreover, the delimitations of viral species and populations are often not well defined. However, viral phylogenies can identify whether extant viruses encountered in a given host are less or more directly linked to common ancestors, providing clues to virus origins4,5,6.",

We define as ARs those taxa of extant animals that contain higher genetic virus diversity than target taxa, harbour the virus continuously on the level of social groups (with or without disease)4,7, and are naturally infected beyond the geographical limits of communicating social groups3,4. These cumulative parameters are amenable to field investigations, without the requirement to manipulate wild animals and their habitats extensively. Nevertheless, logistical, ethical and ecological limits in field investigations still require a focussing on appropriate candidate taxa. Here, it is helpful to consider that the potential of animals to act as AR can be linked to social and behavioural parameters, which in turn are inherent to taxa. Virus transmission and maintenance is generally favoured by large social groups, close social interaction, high population densities, as well as spatial mobility and fast population turnover2,4,8. It is also helpful to consider that genetic proximity between species is favourable of cross-species pathogen transmission6,9,10,11. For instance, all cumulative criteria are met by the best studied of relationships between a virus genus and its AR, the influenza A virus in waterfowl3,9,10.",

A simplified criterion based on pairwise amino acid distance matrices was used to estimate how many novel virus species might have been detected (refer to Methods section). In total, 66 novel PV taxa at the level of putative species were discernible.

A bat virus of high similarity to mumps virus was fully sequenced from a bat spleen (15,378 nucleotides, (Supplementary Fig. S2)). Amino acid similarity was well above 90% in all genes except P (89.5%), suggesting this virus and human mumps to be conspecific.

These viruses (Hendra virus (HeV) in Australia, Nipah virus (NiV) in Asia) have been sporadically acquired from bats of the Pteropus genus by humans, swine and horses. We have recently detected small sequence fragments of potentially related viruses in a colony of E. helvum fruit bats in Ghana12. The present data identify at least 23 distinct viral clades in phylogenetic relation to henipaviruses in six bat species sampled in five different African countries (Fig. 2c). On the basis of the minimal genetic distance between HeV and NiV (7% in the analysed L-gene fragment), the African viruses were estimated to pertain to 19 novel virus species in the genus Henipavirus (Figs 2c and 5). Full genome sequencing of a representative virus (GH-M74a) from a bat spleen confirmed formal classification in the genus Henipavirus (18,530 nucleotides, (Supplementary Fig. S3)). It was noted that the RdRp gene of the analysed African virus contained the catalytic motif GDNQ, as typical of the order Mononegavirales, whereas HeV and NiV have an atypical GDNE motif. Sequencing of this motif in representatives of all major African virus clades also yielded GDNQ, supporting the idea that African rather than Asian viruses are identical to generic ancestors in this highly conserved motif. In addition, the GDNE signature typical of HeV and NiV was found in a small fraction of African viruses, and these were in closest phylogenetic relationship to HeV and NiV (Fig. 2c). The most parsimonious explanation for the diversion of signatures in this highly conserved motif was a single change in a common ancestor to the GDNE-containing clade, as opposed to hypothetical convergent acquisitions of GDNQ in all but one of the parallel lineages. The GDNE-ancestral virus would most likely have existed in Africa, and would have been ancestral to HeV and NiV as well.",

RdRp- and N-gene fragments were phylogenetically congruent and no signs of genomic recombination were seen (Fig. 5b).",

The numbers of deduced transitions between ordinal categories of hosts including bats, rodents, primates, carnivores, ungulates and birds were estimated and averaged over >10,000 trees. To achieve a proper representation of PV from hosts other than bats and rodents, reference sequences were selected from GenBank so as to provide a maximal genetic diversity per ordinal host category (Fig. 8a).

We believe that we have assembled the largest and most diversified single-sample set for investigating viruses in mammalian hosts. We focused on bats and rodents because of their unique properties among the mammals in terms of large social group sizes, intense social interaction and high population densities. Further criteria included high spatial mobility in the case of bats, and high population turnover in the case of rodents1,2,4,30. However, our data were not limited to these taxa, as an essential part of our analysis involved database-derived PV from a large range of other mammals as well as birds. The evolutionary distance between the analysed host taxa considerably exceeded that of either the bats or the rodents studied. It should be mentioned that PV entries in GenBank with and without our new data were not over-emphasising chiropteran or rodent hosts. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, the majority of PV entries were from primates, birds, carnivores and ungulates.

More recent studies have suggested to improve the detection of novel viruses by hypothesis-free approaches such as random cDNA amplification from serum followed by deep sequencing32. Inclusion of such an approach in our study indeed revealed novel viral sequences that should be investigated further, but did not yield any PV.

            "text": "ICTV currently lists 36 accepted PV species. Gene databases comprise more viruses, many of which are only partially sequenced and not classified into defined species (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Although 83 clearly distinct PV taxa could be discriminated in our data set based on phylogeny, a classification criterion using a distance threshold comparable to that between HeV and NiV (7.0\u20137.5% in the L-gene fragment used) identified 66 independent novel taxonomic entities on the rank of tentative species to be represented in our data. Nevertheless, the number of novel taxa added to the PV phylogeny is unlikely to cause a bias toward bat- and rodent viruses in subsequent analyses of host associations. This is foremostly because reference sequences in these analyses were selected to maximise the patristic distance within each genus of PV (Fig. 8a). The algorithm underlying the parsimony-based ancestral state reconstruction only counts host switches once per resolved phylogenetic root point, irrespective of the number of depending leaves carrying identical traits. In general, probabilistic approaches such as ML- and Bayesian methods are considered more powerful than parsimony models for the reconstruction of character states evolving along phylogenetic branches34. However, this is mainly because probabilistic models take branch lengths into account, whereas parsimony-based methods only consider tree topology34. For the particular task of reconstructing viral host associations, we favour parsimony approaches out of theoretical considerations. First, we had to assume that host transition happens rarely and is unlikely to take place in a bidirectional manner, because of the fitness valley effect that will prevent host changes to be reversed easily4,10. In particular, viruses conquering a new host will leave behind population immunity in their original AR, preventing re-introduction, and making back and forward transitions (as well as host switching as a whole) a rare process4,10. Another argument was the uncertainty of deeper branch lengths in viral phylogenies35. More recent studies on non-retroviral RNA viruses invading mammalian germlines demonstrated tremendous discrepancies between apparent evolutionary rates of extant RNA viruses versus those of phylogenetic stem lineages36,37,38,39. Rate differences in deep branches will have great influence on probabilistic models, but will not affect parsimony assumptions. Even though recent findings of viral germline fossils comply with the idea that ancient PV may have existed in mammals36,37,38,39, such data are so far unavailable for PV, and we have not attempted in our analysis to determine the evolutionary origins of PV. Such an analysis would require a different approach to sampling, as viruses from taxa other than mammals and birds are currently underrepresented in databases. To attenuate the contribution of deep phylogenetic nodes, we have limited our analysis to an estimation of trait switches along trees, rather than inferring host associations for deep phylogenetic nodes. With this limitation in mind, we can conclude that bats have most often been the donors of those viruses currently encountered in other mammals.",

These analyses confirmed the results of the parsimony model and formally excluded other host hypotheses within the available data set. However, it should be mentioned that ancestral state analyses have not been systematically applied to the theoretical problem of viral host switching before. Many open questions remain, including the essential issue of developing significance criteria in host hypothesis testing. Only if complex data sets like ours become available for several other virus taxa, it will be possible to approach this major theoretical task.

            "text": "Beyond phylogenetic analysis, we have identified traits of the natural history of infection that suggest a specific connection between PV and bats. The epidemiology of a morbilli-related virus was fundamentally different from that of measles virus in humans, or that of Rinderpest in cattle. Human measles is the prototype of viruses depending on steady transmission in sufficiently large social groups, potentially absent from isolated and remote populations41. Black41 has defined this pattern of pathogen prevalence as the 'introduced disease' pattern, based on observations in isolated human tribes. Strikingly, in bats, the morbilli-related virus was excreted by adult animals at similar rates as by young animals, which is very untypical of morbilliviruses in other mammals. This pattern of prevalence was classified by Black41 as 'endemic\u2014high incidence, low morbidity', as exemplified in humans by hepatitis B virus or herpes viruses. Some researchers have argued that bats in general might deal with viral infections differently than other mammals42. However, we have recently described a variance of viral persistence patterns in bats that is congruent with observations in other mammals, with a typical 'introduced disease' pattern for astro- and coronaviruses, although a bat adenovirus in the same group of animals showed Black's 'endemic' pattern41,43. Adenoviruses provide a good template to explain the shedding pattern of the morbilli-related virus found in the present study, as they are known to persist in tissue and to be shed without signs beyond the acute phase of disease\u2014a property determining the ability of viruses to persist in small populations41,44. Accordingly, the morbilli-related virus in our study was detected in a species of bats forming small- to medium-sized social groups (M. myotis), possibly requiring long-term excretion for virus maintenance on group level. This is rather untypical for morbilliviruses in other mammals that depend heavily on efficient transmission and sufficient group size to be maintained30,41,45. In this light, the difference in organ association between bats and rodents was quite interesting. Although PVs in rodents were associated with the kidney, favouring excretion, their highest concentrations and prevalences in bats were seen in the spleen. Although we have no further direct proof, this matches the concept that bat-borne PV might not as much depend on highly efficient transmission, but might routinely employ mechanisms of persistence to follow Black's 'endemic' pattern of prevalence41. This anomality might indeed identify bats as AR of these viruses. Moreover, the morbilli-related bat virus was detected in Europe, but also in an unrelated species forming rather small social groups in sub-Saharan Africa. Even though we have not been able to conduct longitudinal investigations of excretion in other PV genera, detection in groups without social connection as well as re-detection in subsequent years was seen also for rubula- and henipaviruses in this study. Detection of these viruses was not associated with changes in serum chemistry parameters, suggesting symptomless infection despite virus replication in internal organs, which may be regarded as typical for a virus in its natural host context that is not dependent on efficient horizontal transmission4,7,46.",

            "text": "Beyond virus evolution and ecology, these data might have important implications for public health. HeV and NiV may be of African descent and have highly diversified relatives in Africa. These viruses might be associated with unrecognised disease, given the tremendous number of unresolved cases of encephalitis often ascribed to malaria in Africa47. Observed patterns of viral loads suggest that virus could be acquired during slaughtering of bats for alimentary purposes48, but possibly also through contact with ubiquitous bat faeces (Supplementary Tables S3 and S8). It is for this same reason that the significance of Henipavirus-related agents in widely distributed bats in America deserves urgent further investigation. Moreover, the finding of agents serologically related to eradicable viruses, such as mumps, distemper and measles virus, is highly relevant in assessing perspectives and consequences of virus eradication19,49,50,51. Clearly, the bats investigated in this study carried viruses that were only similar but not identical to those agents endemic in humans or livestock. These new data therefore emphasise the importance of investigating possible transmission chains, as exemplified by the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, in which an agent derived from bats was probably passed to humans by intermediate hosts such as carnivores52. In the case of the mumps-related bat virus, a direct antigenetic relatedness between human and bat viruses has been confirmed, and the close genetic proximity between both viruses suggests that even cross-neutralisation might be possible. In light of the still narrow representation of genetic diversity of bats covered in this study (ca. 7.5% of bat species), further research might reveal further bat-borne PV in close relationship to known pathogens of humans and livestock. If antigenic overlap exists, this could become relevant for virus eradication concepts. Relevant antigenic overlap would be defined by proof of cross-neutralisation between reservoir-borne and human or livestock pathogens. In this latter case, elimination of circulating virus and the subsequent cessation of vaccination might leave humans or livestock susceptible for reservoir-borne, antigenetically related viruses.",

Bats and rodents were identified by trained field biologists. Fresh bat droppings were collected on plastic film below roost sites12. Additionally, bats were caught with mist nets at roost or foraging sites, kept separately in bags until individual examination. Sampling relied on faecal pellets produced in bags, vein puncture for serum samples and mouth swabs. For organ samples, bats were euthanised with ketamine and dissected immediately. Rodents were caught with live traps or snap traps, euthanised and dissected. For faecal specimens, ca. 100 mg of faeces was suspended in 500 \u03bcl of RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) immediately after collection. Suspensions were homogenised by vortexing, and 50 \u03bcl were suspended into 560 \u03bcl of buffer AVL from the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) and processed further according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For blood or serum samples, up to 140 \u03bcl (depending on the available quantity) were extracted. For solid organs, approximately 30 mg of tissue were homogenised in a TissueLyser (Qiagen) or a ball-mill tissue grinder (Genogrinder 2000, Spex Centripep), followed by extraction of RNA using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) or the ABI PRISM 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Elution volumes were generally 50 \u03bcl for serum/blood and faecal specimens, and 100 \u03bcl for tissue specimens. RNA specimens were subjected to molecular screening for PVs using a panel of oligonucleotides and RT\u2013PCR assays listed in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10.",

The data set used for inference of Paramyxovviridae phylogenies comprised 559 nucleotide (nt). An additional analysis was done for only those rubulaviruses for which only a shorter 217 nt fragment could be amplified (see Fig. 2a, note that Supplementary Fig. S1 includes only rubulaviruses with complete 559 nt coverage). Bayesian phylogenies were calculated with MrBayes V3.256 using amino acid sequences (WAG+G model) and nucleotide sequences (GTR+I+G model). Both analyses yielded identical topologies (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Convergence of chains was confirmed by the PSRF statistic in MrBayes57, as well as by visual inspection of individual traces using TRACER from the BEAST package58. Outgroups were Rabies virus (GenBank, NC_001542) for phylogenies, including the complete family Paramyxoviridae, Newcastle Disease virus for phylogenies of the genus Rubulavirus (GenBank, NC_002617) and Human Parainfluenzavirus 1 (GenBank, NC_003461) for the genera Henipa- and Morbillivirus. In parallel to the Bayesian analyses, maximum likelihood algorithms (WAG+G substitution model, 5 gamma categories and 1,000 bootstrap replicates) were applied using PhyML V3.059. Trees were visualised with FigTree V1.3.1 from the BEAST package58.",

Symbols on the x axis depict donor (large symbols) and recipient hosts in the level of ordinal mammalian categories (bats, rodents, primates, carnivores, cetartiodactyls) and birds. Before the analysis, the rabies virus outgroup was removed, because this lyssavirus would have to be mapped to a bat host, biasing host state reconstruction for the root of the PV tree toward bats. Four single PV were removed because they were the only available PV in their particular host species (salmon, snake, dolphin, tupaia). (c) Summary of results from hypothesis testing using maximum likelihood (ML) ancestral state reconstruction in Bayestraits34. After analysis of 1,000 ML bootstrap trees, the trait change model was restricted by one of the ten criteria listed, and the resulting average likelihood of the restricted model was compared with that of the unrestricted model. The list shows the factor (n-fold) by which each restricted model was less likely than the unrestricted model (averaged over 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the underlying ML tree).",
