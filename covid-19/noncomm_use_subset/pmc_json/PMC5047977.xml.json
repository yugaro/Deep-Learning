Individuals who commit an error should be held responsible for their delinquency, and the delinquency is normally addressed with disciplinary measures. This paradigm remains the mainstream belief in medicine and elsewhere [5]. However, the person approach has been challenged because people do not choose to make mistakes; bad things happen to good people [9]. People in the healthcare industry have lost jobs, suffered serious stress, or taken their own life after being blamed for errors [1011]. Indeed, maintaining this tradition is likely to victimize hard-working innocent people and delay the development of a safer healthcare environment [5].",

Errors occur when a series of failures in the system occur, which is well illustrated by the Swiss cheese model [5]. This model likens human systems to multiple slices of Swiss cheese with holes, stacked side by side. Although highly technological systems have many defensive layers, such as guidelines and protocols, to prevent errors, each layer also has its own deficiencies like the holes in Swiss cheese. The presence of holes in any one \"slice\" does not allow a risk to materialize, as another layer of defense is in place. However, when the holes in many layers momentarily line up, a mistake passes through the holes in all of the slices, resulting in an unwanted incident. The systems approach advocates that a medical error is the result of a system flaw, not a character flaw [5], which makes it easier for an individual to report an error promptly and honestly. This kind of robust reporting helps identify errors and strengthens problematic areas so that the same error does not occur again [9].",

After his wife's tragic death, he expected an investigation by an independent body. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the airline industry routinely investigates all accidents [12]. He was surprised when he was told that no such investigation would take place unless he sued or filed a formal complaint. An independent investigation was conducted, but Mr. Bromiley did not file charges against individuals and only hoped that some lesson might be taught to others as a result of a fair investigation. As he wished, all professionals involved in the case remained to serve and help the system to avoid similar errors. Implementing the systems approach is vital to improving patient safety because it enables medical professionals to learn lessons from their errors [89].",

This is the first legislation in the world that has sought to improve patient safety by ensuring that all adverse events are reported and that the National Board of Health will disseminate the results nationally [21]. The US Senate passed the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) in 2005 [22]. The PSQIA introduced a voluntary reporting system to facilitate assessment of data to improve patient safety and healthcare quality. The UK's National Patient Safety Agency created the National Reporting and Learning System in 2003, which is a nationwide voluntary event-reporting system for patient safety [23]. Japanese healthcare workers are also familiar with event-reporting systems because all Japanese hospitals established an in-house, legally bound event-reporting system in 2002 [24]. The Patient Safety Act, which includes a voluntary reporting system, will go into effect in July 2016 in Korea [25].",

Several technological innovations have contributed substantially to patient safety [26]. One has been to introduce real-time patient monitoring systems, such as electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and capnography. The laryngeal mask airway and video laryngoscope have had a huge effect on managing patients with a difficult airway. Another strategy adopted by anesthesiologists to improve patient safety has been the establishment of guidelines and standards to provide guidance in specific clinical situations [26]. In particular, guidelines for managing difficult intubation and for regional anesthesia in patients taking antithrombotic agents have important implications for patient safety.",

The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) is a pioneer organization dedicated to patient safety that was launched in late 1985 as an independent nonprofit organization with the vision that \"no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia\" [31]. The APSF publishes a quarterly newsletter on anesthesia and patient safety and has funded many important projects that would probably never have been financed by a \"traditional\" organization. The most outstanding achievement of the APSF program has been helping to create a cadre of experts who devote their careers to patient safety by financially supporting them [26]. The American Medical Association, influenced by the huge success of the APSF, created the National Patient Safety Foundation decades later [32].",

The quality of equipment, procedural techniques, and anesthetic medicine is quite standardized among developed countries, partly due to the tremendous marketing effort of multinational pharmaceutical and device companies. Technologic developments for patient safety can be adopted quickly because no time or sophisticated knowledge is required. Furthermore, outcomes are easily recognizable. However, creating the system and applying a training program, such as ANTS, are taxing and require time and commitment. Considerable interest in the use of ANTS has been generated worldwide, and ANTS is currently used in anesthetic simulation training in many countries, such as Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands [30]. Unfortunately, no attempt has been made by Korean anesthesia societies to introduce a CRM-style training course or establish a simulation center. In addition, no patient safety committee has been created by The Korean Society of Anesthesiologists.",

Koreans are more reluctant to mention another individual's behavior for fear of offending them; if the individual is senior, such action is often regarded as challenging authority. Feedback and communication about errors are not prevalent in the Korean healthcare industry because people believe that this kind of discussion may humiliate coworkers, and they are more concerned with punitive measures [3435].",

Even in Western culture, it is difficult for junior staff to question seniors about their actions. This is even more difficult in East Asian cultures, including Korea, where younger people are expected to show their respect to their elders and superiors due to the long influence of Confucianism. For example, Korean Air had more plane crashes than almost any other airline in the world by the end of the 1990s. Gladwell blamed those crashes on crew members whose cultural legacy made them too deferential to communicate clearly about a problem that could cause the plane to crash [37]. This hierarchical communication also exists in the Korean medical profession and is one of the main causes of adverse events. Because medical service is delivered by a team, communication with other team members is important during patient care. Strong verbal communication skills in the context of a complex medical system is at the core of patient safety and effective teamwork. Following is a typical case that shows how important communication is to patient safety.",

The anesthesia resident said, \"10 milli would be enough.\" The anesthesia resident interpreted the word \"milli\" as short for milligram. However, the ENT resident considered that \"milli\" was short for milliliter and wrote the order as follows: inject 500 mg/10 cc of ketamine over 1 min. This was 50 times the therapeutic dose. A nurse was concerned about the dose and asked the resident \"Is this right?\" to verify the order. The resident approved the medication by answering the nurse, \"Yes, give it.\" The nurse executed the order. This accident was discovered when the parent reported that the child had not woken up from sedation for several hours after finishing the computed tomography scan.

This type of interaction reflects the typical authoritarian culture in Korea. Higher-ranking individuals generally speak and then expect subordinates, who are usually listeners, to understand. If they fail, then it is the listener's fault. In contrast, Western languages are typically \"sender orientated,\" meaning it is the speaker who has the responsibility to communicate clearly and unambiguously [38]. This style emphasizes the speaker's role in transmitting the information correctly from the beginning, which is obviously more reasonable [36]. In this way, we can reduce the possibility of miscommunication.",
