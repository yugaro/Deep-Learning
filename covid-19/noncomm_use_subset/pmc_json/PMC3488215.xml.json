Nucleoside 2498 is located at the start of a conserved sequence CXUCGAU in the central loop of domain V of 23S rRNA that has four modification sites (Figure 1A). In high-resolution crystal structures of ribosomes from different bacteria (14\u201316), C2498 and U2500 are base paired to G2454 and A2453, respectively, at the end of helix 89, and the modification site is surrounded by the peptidyl transferase loop, the 570 region and the 2031 region of 23S rRNA (Figure 1B). The 2\u2032O methylation adds hydrophobicity and has been suggested to stabilize the structure by filling a void in the packing between these regions (2). Sequence analysis showed that RlmM contains a C-terminal Rossmann-like fold methyltransferase (MTase) domain that uses S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor. This class of enzymes contain a 2\u2032O-ribose MTase-specific consensus K-D-K-E/H catalytic tetrad necessary to perform methyl transfer from AdoMet to the 2\u2032OH of the target (17).",

Furthermore, in analysis of ribosome assembly intermediates accumulated in vivo in the presence of the antibiotics erythromycin or chloramphenicol, the C2498 modification appeared in the intermediate steps of 50S assembly. Thus, RlmM in vivo must also be active on 23S substrates that have bound a subset of the ribosomal proteins (18). Detailed structural information regarding 50S assembly intermediates is lacking, but the modification site is not accessible in the mature 50S subunit (Figure 1B). The knockout of RlmM is viable but leads to lower fitness compared with wild type in competition assays (9).",

Most RNA modifications, such as 2\u2032O methylation, can be detected directly using primer extension by reverse transcriptase and gel electrophoresis (24). Low dNTP concentrations cause reverse transcriptase to pause one nucleotide before a 2\u2032O methylation site (31) and the optimal dGTP concentration for Cm2498 detection reported by Purta et al. was also used here. A prominent C2499 band, induced by methylation on C2498, appeared after incubation of IVT with RlmM, showing RlmM does not rely on prior modifications to the 23S rRNA for activity (Figure 2A). Smaller fragments were also detected at G2502, G2508 and U2511 in all lanes, presumably due to strong secondary structure and limiting dGTP for the templated C that follows in each case. A reverse transcriptase stop on U2504 corresponding to wild-type methylation on A2503 can also be seen in the WT lane and not in the IVT lane, as expected (Figure 2A). Standardizing the intensity of the C2499 band to the average of band intensities of these smaller fragments allowed comparisons between lanes. On the basis of band intensity, the extent of modification in the in vitro reaction is nearly the same as found in the E. coli wild-type 23S rRNA (Figure 2A), which was previously determined to be stoichiometric on 23S rRNA (32). In addition, RlmM is capable of modifying unmodified 23S rRNA domain V alone to the same extent as full length IVT (Figure 2B). This demonstrates that RlmM recognition is neither dependent on other domains of the 23S rRNA nor other rRNA modifications.\n",

The minimal THUMP domain was first observed in the structure of the tRNA thiouridine synthase ThiI (38), where it is similarly fused to an N-terminal FLD. This arrangement was subsequently observed in several structures and is now classified as the THUMP domain family in the SCOP database.

Interestingly, in both of these enzymes, the THUMP domains are followed by catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domains, but in a different orientation compared with RlmM (further discussed in the subsequent sections). The same is true for a putative methylase from Clostridium difficile. THUMP domains only share 10\u201315% sequence identity, explaining why these domains were not detected in sequence analysis. The THUMP domain also occurs in combination with other catalytic domains; an N-terminal cytidine deaminase domain in the archaeal tRNA C8 deaminase CDAT8 (42) and a C-terminal PP-loop pyrophosphatase domain in ThiI (38). In TAN1, a protein essential for the ac4C modification in tRNA, a tRNA-binding THUMP domain occurs by itself and needs an un-identified catalytic subunit for modification activity (37,43). Thus, the THUMP domain has the role of RNA recognition in several different enzymes that act on rRNA or tRNA.",

The lengths of \u03b24 and \u03b27 at the center of the sheet affect the shape of the half-barrel, so that RlmM has more of a V-shape, whereas ThiI where both strands participate in the two sheets forms a shallow U and Trm14, TrmN and RlmKL, which have only \u03b24 bridging the two sheets are intermediate. In RlmM, helix \u03b14 is also longer than in the other structures in the direction of the barrel opening, which further contributes to the closing of the opening by pushing \u03b24 inwards. RlmM also contains an extra 310 helix that forms hydrophobic interactions with the center of the barrel. Each of the compared THUMP domains have unique structural features, such as an extra \u03b2-hairpin in Trm14 and a longer \u03b11 in ThiI, suggesting that the ancient THUMP domain (37) has evolved to form RNA-binding modules of different shape (Figure 5B\u2013D).\n",

Structure-based sequence alignment (Figure 6A) and structural superposition confirmed that the catalytic tetrad K191-D277-K306-E347 is present in the RlmM MTase domain. A closer look revealed that while residues K191, D277 and E347 of RlmM superimpose on the conserved K, D and E/H residues of all the 2\u2032O-ribose MTases, residue K306 of the RlmM MTase domain is shifted forward by two residues relative to RrmJ and Nsp5 and superimposes onto the corresponding lysine residues of FlpA and YiiB (Figure 6B). This shift in RlmM differs from the alignment reported based on the primary sequence, where the FXXK motif in RlmM was aligned to the same motif in RrmJ and Nsp5 (9). A previous bioinformatic and phylogenetic study identified the two-residue shift of the second catalytic K in fibrillarin (52), but the shift in YiiB/TlyA (Figure 6A and B) has not been reported before.\n",

In RlmM, the motif II loop (D240\u2013G242) has an open conformation in all our structures. In the P3121 structure, the motif II loop is involved in crystal packing, but there is no evidence for conformational changes in this loop upon AdoMet binding to other 2\u2032O-ribose MTases. The motif II loop would need to re-orient by 3.1 \u00c5 for N241 to be positioned to cover the adenine ring from the top as the corresponding Leu in RrmJ and Nsp5 (Supplementary Figure S5) and the Tyr in FlpA.

Although key catalytic residues are normally conserved among functionally related proteins, there are several examples of long- and short-distance migration of essential residues in the primary sequence (58). In these cases, although a residue is shifted in the sequence and structure, the positions of the atoms involved in catalysis are preserved. In 2\u2032O-ribose MTases, the position of the \u03b5-amino group of the second catalytic lysine is thought to be crucial for deprotonation of the ribose 2\u2032OH, enabling its nucleophilic attack on the AdoMet methyl group (46,59) (Supplementary Figure S3). In FlpA, binding of the substrate RNA re-orients the Lys so that its \u03b5-amino group can make the proper interaction with the 2\u2032OH of the ribose, whereas RlmM and YiiB without RNA and AdoMet adopt conformations where the side chains of K306 and K157 are positioned similarly to the FlpA complex with substrate RNA (Figure 6B). This suggests that two optimized variants of the catalytic site for 2\u2032O-ribose methylation have evolved and that further analysis of the evolutionary relationship between RlmM, FlpA, YiiB and RrmJ would be of interest.",

Perhaps crystal contacts of the open motif II loop in the P3121 crystal form have a stabilizing effect on the AdoMet-binding site. Another possibility is that the crystallization additive dextran sulfate affects binding of AdoMet. The AdoMet-binding site is open and shallow compared with other 2\u2032O MTases (Figure 7B\u2013E), and the ligand does not make the interactions with the catalytic tetrad that would be needed for catalysis. Therefore, we hypothesize that RlmM may be a partner-dependent MTase that forms the correct interactions with AdoMet only in presence of RNA substrate. As exemplified in the subsequent sections, there are several examples of RNA MTases that only bind AdoMet in optimal position for methyl transfer in the presence of an auxiliary protein or the RNA substrate.",

The THUMP domains seem to have evolved different shapes from a common structural scaffold and distinct surfaces for RNA recognition in the different enzymes. In ThiI and RlmKL, a \u2018channel\u2019 formed by the THUMP beta half-barrel has been suggested to be used for RNA binding (38,41), but in RlmM, the corresponding groove is filled. Similar to proposals for Trm14/TrmN (40), the likely RNA-binding surface of RlmM involves both domains and a positively charged inter-domain linker; but in our model, RlmM would use a distinct surface of the THUMP domain for RNA binding compared with Trm14/TrmN and RlmKL.
