It is associated with a 35% mortality rate, primarily due to multiorgan failure (Rivers et al., 2016, Zumla et al., 2015). Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) can be transmitted either from non-human to human where dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for this virus or by a human to the human transmission which requires close contact (Cotten et al., 2013; de Groot et al., 2013) Many studies suggested that MERS-CoV has a male predominance prevalence with a median age of 40 years at illness onset (Aleanizy et al., 2017, Chan et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2017). Data showed that underlying immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant medications and therapies or diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Aleanizy et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2017).",

Majority of the cases were reported by Saudi Arabia, with cases reported from other countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, the United States of America, and Asia (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) WHO MERS Global Summary and Assessment of Risk Global summary, 2018).

A suspected case which defined as an instance of admission to a health care facility with any clinical symptoms that suggest infection or a history of contact with established cases, will trigger a laboratory MERS-CoV testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for MERS-CoV in swab samples collected at admission (Aleanizy et al., 2017).",

Although, our study has a large female representation in our sample and which can be due to the likelihood of the sharp increase in health care workers- which likely to be female, screening upon exposure to a patient with a possible history of MERS infection. The other reason is many health care institutions became very strict with screening and testing any suspected cases to prevent MERS infection outbreaks which increase the female detection. Our study suggests that gender difference is associated with an increase in the likelihood of MERS infection. Also, our study suggests diabetic patient are more likely to have a confirmed MERS infection compared to nondiabetic patients which have been also reported previously in the literature (Zumla et al., 2015).",

Although many diabetic patients were on metformin, our analysis shows that it has no effect on MERS infection. Similarly, sulfonylureas were not associated with an increase or decrease in the likelihood of the infection. Of the diabetic medication, patient on DDP-4 inhibitors was less likely to have MERS infection. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV was identified as a dipeptidyl peptidase receptor.
