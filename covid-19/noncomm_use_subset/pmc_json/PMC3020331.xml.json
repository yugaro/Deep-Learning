Early diagnosis and a complete understanding of the pathological features of the H1N1 virus are important to help to improve treatment and the prognosis of this lethal disease. Analysis of the lung tissue from an open lung biopsy (OLB) of these severe cases can help in understanding the pathogenesis of this severe and sometimes fatal development.

The influenza virus triggers pulmonary inflammation owing to an infiltration of inflammatory cells and an immune response. Bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for the virus.13,14 Normally, influenza viruses are recognized and destroyed by innate immune mechanisms which involve macrophages, interferon (IFN) \u03b1, \u03b2 and other cytokines, natural killer (NK) cells and complement. When influenza viruses escape from these early defense mechanisms, they are captured and eliminated by adaptive immune mechanisms, where T and B cells and their antigen\u2010specific effectors (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and antibodies) target the virus. Additionally, antigen\u2010specific memory cells (T and B cells) are involved in the prevention of the subsequent viral infection.14 ",

The membranous and respiratory bronchioles were extensively compromised by epithelial necrosis, squamous metaplasia, and obliteration by fibroplasia (Figure 1A\u2013F). The parenchyma was modified by extensive alveolar collapse, dilatation of the airspaces, alveolar hemorrhage, and sparse hyaline membrane formation (Figure 1G\u2013I). There was interstitial thickening, with mild to moderate fibroplasia (Figure 1I), but a disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells, mainly histiocytes, including multinucleated forms, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes (Figure 1J\u2013K).",

As previously reported, possible mechanisms of damage include direct injury to the respiratory and alveolar epithelium exposing the basement membrane and leading to alveolar collapse by loss of surfactant,13,14,21 with a secondary cytokine storm.22 This is followed by exudation of macromolecules from the circulation, which finally form hyaline membranes. Activation of the cytokines is part of the immune reaction aiming to eradicate the virus. In this study, the systemic IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 cytokine activation probably resulted in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in the bronchiole\u2010associated lymphoid tissue and possibly also mediated the epithelial necrosis.23 A mild inflammatory infiltration is most often seen in viral pneumonias; this has been explained by a cytokine\u2010mediated blockade of lymphocytopoiesis and also by blockade of release from the bone marrow.24 ",

This finding may be supported by Kim and colleagues,25 who described in S\u2010OIV infection, maximal indices of TNF\u03b1 expression in lungs of infected pigs in the first days of the infection and then a gradual decrease. Conversely, we found a very strong expression of IL\u20104, IL\u201010 and iNOS by macrophages. The sparse inflammatory and immune reaction found in our samples, which involves targetting of the virus by NK cells, lymphocytes T and B cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocyte cells, as well as CD1a and S100 cells, may be due to a combination of lymphoid tissue necrosis and apoptosis and exhaustion of lymphoid proliferation in response to the cytokine overdrive. In addition, the high IL\u201010 expression associated with its anti\u2010inflammatory action may explain the low degree of inflammation observed in our cases. Taken together, our results suggest that in S\u2010OIV infection, altered innate and adaptative immune responses may lead to incomplete virus eradication in the primary target of the infection and, consequently, imbalance between inflammation and reparation, resulting in bronchiolar obliteration and DAD.",

First, we demonstrated apoptosis and necrosis in the bronchiolar epithelium together with viral\u2010like particles, thus suggesting the bronchiolar epithelium as the primary target of the virus infection. Second, we documented the submicroscopic pattern of a clastogenic DAD in S\u2010OIV infection. Third, we found indirect evidence of virus infection in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells represented by the TRS and CCC. These submicroscopic structures were demonstrated ultrastructurally in the lung tissue of all the patients and their presence suggests an inactivation of the virus by oseltamivir treatment or an altered innate immune response of these patients. They appeared mainly in respiratory cells and AECs and have previously been described in a variety of cell types.28,29 Usually, they occur in endothelial cells and lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune diseases and viral infections.30 Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome present TRS and CCC in these same cells.31 The mechanism of TRS and CCC production in vivo is not definitely established. Nevertheless, clinical and experimental studies have shown that the presence of both structures in these diseases is directly associated with the increase of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 but not with IFN\u03b3.29 ",

These observations reinforce the hypothesis that the primary target cells for S\u2010IOV infection are probably the bronchiolar epithelium. The atypical morphology of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells was probably related to viral cytopathic effects or reactive changes. In fact, the presence of multinucleated epithelial cells is not exclusive to S\u2010IOV, and is seen in pneumonia caused by the family of Paramyxoviridae, including parainfluenza viruses, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus and, perhaps, metapneumovirus.31 Although multinucleated cells were seen in our cases, these probably reflect non\u2010specific secondary changes.",
