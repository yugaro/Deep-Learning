Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostic tests are important for the control of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks. Clinical guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV are based on the interim recommendations from the WHO, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), and other available resources [1234]. To date, only a few studies have reported the molecular detection of this disease during an outbreak [5678]. To validate the current guidelines for MERS-CoV laboratory testing, we retrospectively reviewed the results of MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assays in the Korean tertiary care hospital with the largest number of MERS cases (Samsung Medical Center). The Institutional Review Board of the Samsung Medical Center (IRB #2015-06-201) approved this study.",

Screen-positive specimens were confirmed by the subsequent amplification of ORF1a. A positive test result was defined as a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed a threshold of \u226435 cycles for both upE and ORF1a. For inconclusive results, a specimen was considered \"equivocal\" if the upE result was positive, but the cycle threshold (Ct) value for ORF1a was between 35 and 40. Additionally, we interpreted the result as \"indeterminate\" if: 1) the upE result was positive, but the Ct value for ORF1a was undetected or 2) the Ct value for upE was between 35 and 40 [39].",

From sputum specimens, two, six, and one specimens were positive, equivocal, and indeterminate, respectively. However, only one equivocal result was obtained from NPS specimens. The detection rate for NPS specimens was significantly lower than that for sputum specimens in both upE and ORF1a tests (P=0.0078 and 0.0156, respectively). The low virus detection rate in NPS specimens early in MERS-CoV infection illustrates the importance of specimen type for diagnosis. It is suggested that URT specimens are not suitable for diagnosing MERS-CoV infections. On the basis of the WHO interim recommendations, LRT specimens are preferred for detecting MERS-CoV RNA, but collection of URT specimens in addition to LRT is recommended whenever possible [2]. US CDC guidelines endorse the collection of LRT, URT, and serum specimen types for testing [10]. Although simultaneous specimen collection is ideal, it is not feasible because of practical limitations during large and complex outbreaks. On the basis of our results, it seems sufficient to obtain LRT specimens prior to URT or other specimens, especially in early-stage diagnostic testing.",

In many of the confirmed MERS patients (16/51, 31.4%), the initial tests were negative or inconclusive, with not only URT but also LRT specimens. Fig. 1 shows a schematic plot of the detection for MERS-CoV RNA in respiratory tract specimens for the 16 laboratory-confirmed cases. Of note, four consecutive tests yielded negative results in one confirmed case. The patient was confirmed to be MERS-positive on the fifth test. These findings highlight the importance of implementing guidelines for laboratory testing, where patients should be retested by using a LRT specimen if initial testing is inconclusive or negative in a patient who is suspected to have MERS-CoV infection [12].",
