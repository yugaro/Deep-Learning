            "text": "In May 2013, a devastating outbreak of epidemic diarrhea in young piglets commenced in swine farms of the United States, causing immense economic concerns. The mortality can reach up to 100% in piglets less than 10 days of age, with a recorded loss of at least 8 million neonatal pigs since 2013 (1, 2). Enteric viruses, such as swine enteric coronaviruses (SECoVs), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), were isolated from these outbreaks (3, 4) and characterized (5). However, despite intensive biosecurity measures adopted to prevent the spread of SECoV in many farms and the use of two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conditionally licensed vaccines against PEDV, the outbreaks continue and have now spread to many other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, and Ecuador in the Americas (6) and Ukraine (7). Repeated outbreaks have also been reported on the same farms that were previously infected with PEDV. In June 2014, the USDA issued a federal order to report, monitor, and control swine enteric coronavirus disease (SECD) (8). In our efforts to understand the seemingly uncontrollable porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks, we discovered a novel mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 (MRV3) in feces of pigs from these outbreaks and ring-dried swine blood meal (RDSB). We have also reproduced severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis in neonatal pigs experimentally infected with purified MRV3 strains.",

Orthoreoviruses with 10 discrete RNA segments have been isolated from a wide variety of animal species, including bats, civet cats, birds, reptiles, pigs, and humans (10, 11). Most orthoreoviruses are recognized to cause respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, myocarditis, and central nervous system disease in humans, animals, and birds (11); orthoreovirus genomes are prone to genetic reassortment and intragenic rearrangement (11, 12). The exchange of RNA segments between viruses could lead to molecular diversity and evolution of viruses with increased virulence and host range (13, 14). MRV serotypes 1 to 3 were associated with enteritis, pneumonia, or encephalitis in swine around the world, including China and South Korea (15\u201318). The zoonotic potential of MRV3 has been reported recently (19\u201321). However, porcine orthoreovirus infection of pigs was unknown previously in the United States.",

Among the 18 orthoreovirus-positive fecal samples, 11 samples were further sequence verified using MRV3-S1 gene-specific primers amplifying a 424-bp fragment. Characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE), including syncytium formation and rounding of individual cells, were evident at 48 h postinfection (hpi) in BHK-21 cells inoculated with chloroform-extracted samples of feces and blood meal (Fig. 1A to C). The infected cell monolayers were completely detached by 72 to 96 hpi. Developing chicken embryos died 2 to 5 days postinoculation (dpi) after inoculation by the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) route. Infected chicken embryos showed hemorrhages (\u201ccherry red appearance\u201d) on the body and/or stunted growth (\u201cdwarfing\u201d) (Fig. 1D). MRV3 antigen was detected in infected BHK-21 cells using monoclonal antibody clone 2Q2048 against \u03c31 protein (Fig. 1E to G). The virus isolates from infected BHK-21 cells or chicken embryos were further confirmed as MRV3 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Eight virus isolates were obtained, and two representative isolates (T3/Swine/FS03/USA/2014 and T3/Swine/BM100/USA/2014) were used for further studies.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that the viral genome consists of 10 segments (Fig. 2A). The protein profile of the viruses was consistent with \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03c3 proteins and their subclasses (Fig. 2B). The virions were stable at 56\u00b0C without significant loss of infectivity and remained viable after exposure to 80 or 90\u00b0C for 1 h (Fig. 2C). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of negatively stained virions revealed icosahedral, nonenveloped, double-layered uniform-sized particles reminiscent of members of the family Reoviridae (Fig. 2D). In infected Vero cells, the presence of paracrystalline arrays of virus particles free of organelles (Fig. 2E to G) and viral factories in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2H) was evident. The mean diameter of the virus particles was 82 nm (Fig. 2H, inset), with particle sizes ranging from 80 to 85 nm. The MRV3 isolates (FS03 and BM100) replicated efficiently in BHK-21 cells, with a mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 6.7 log10/ml. Virus infectivity to BHK-21 cells increased after treatment with tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (6.7 to 7.7 log10/ml), suggesting trypsin resistance. The U.S. porcine MRV3 strains were able to hemagglutinate swine erythrocytes, and this property could be specifically inhibited with MRV3 anti-\u03c31 monoclonal antibody.",

The high level of sequence identity between FS03 and BM100 sequences validated our immunofluorescence, gel electrophoresis and virus protein profile data.

On comparison of the deduced amino acids, it appears that with proteins of the L class segment, \u03bb2 protein was homologous to MRV1, while the \u03bb1 and \u03bb3 proteins were highly similar to the MRV1 and -3 prototypes, T1-Lang (T1L) and T3/Dearing (T3D), respectively. In M class proteins, only \u03bcNS was identical to T3D, while \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 were identical to T1L. The sequence alignment of \u03bc1 protein indicated 6 amino acid substitutions that were unique to these isolates in comparison to the T3/Bat/Germany, T3D, T1L, and T2J isolates (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The \u03bc2 protein alignment revealed 15 unique amino acid substitutions compared to the T3/Bat/Germany, T3D, T1L, and T2J sequences (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) and possessed the S208P mutation compared to T3D. In the S class proteins, all of them appear to originate from European bat (MRV3) viruses, with 88% to 98% identity at amino acid level (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The highest diversity among all proteins was observed for the \u03c31 protein, with close homology to T3/Bat/Germany virus (91%). Deduced amino acid sequence analysis of \u03c31 protein revealed that the sialic acid binding domain (NLAIRLP), and protease resistance (249I) and neurotropism (340 D and 419E) residues were conserved in the U.S. porcine orthoreovirus strains. The novel viruses possessed 31 and 11 unique amino acid substitutions in the \u03c31 and \u03c31s proteins in comparison to T3/Bat/Germany and other MRV prototypes, respectively (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).",

Neonatal pigs orally inoculated with purified viruses FS03, BM100, T3/Swine/I03/USA/2014 (I03), or a chloroform extract of blood meal 100 (CBM100) developed clinical illness in all infected animals (100%), with loss of physical activity, severe diarrhea, and decrease in body weight. Infected animals had significantly high mean clinical scores compared to the mock-infected group (P < 0.01). Piglets infected with FS03 and I03 had the highest clinical scores as early as 1 dpi, which peaked at 3 dpi (Fig. 6A). Three pigs in the mock-infected group had a slow recovery from parenteral anesthetics, with elevated mean clinical scores for the first 2 days but returned to normal later. Gross lesions, such as catarrhal enteritis (Fig. 6B) and intussusception (Fig. 6C), were observed in all of the infected animals. The cumulative macroscopic lesion scores of FS03 and I03 were higher than those of other groups on day 4 dpi (Fig. 6D).

Since a federal mandate to report the SECD cases on 5 June 2014, a total of 731 swine premises had been confirmed positive until 22 January 2015 in the United States (22). Strict and intensive biosecurity measures have been adopted on many farms to control SECD, but the disease spread is unabated, and at least 32 states are now affected. Repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds were also reported, suggesting that the SECoVs may not be the sole agents responsible for this unprecedented epidemic diarrhea outbreak in the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador (6), and Ukraine (7).",

We also provide evidence that these novel MRV3 strains are pathogenic to neonatal pigs, leading to lethal enteric disease. More than 80% of ring-dried blood meal feed supplements and 37.5% of the fecal samples from epidemic diarrheic pigs tested in this study were found positive for the novel MRV3. It remains to be determined whether porcine MRV3 is responsible, either primarily or in combination with SECoV, for the current uncontrollable epidemic piglet diarrhea. There have been conflicting reports on the presence of live pathogenic SECoVs in porcine blood products (23, 24). The World Organization for Animal Health Office International des Epizooties (OIE) ad hoc group on PEDV recently concluded that contaminated pig blood products, including spray-dried plasma are not a likely source of infectious PEDV (2, 25) as spray-drying typically inactivates enveloped coronaviruses. Therefore, the presence of chloroform-resistant, infectious MRV3 in RDSB as identified in this study is of great significance considering the current difficulties in arresting the spread of this economically important disease in the U.S. and Canadian swine industries.",

Fusogenic MRVs carry a FAST protein (26), but the U.S. porcine MRV3 strains lack this protein but produce syncytium in infected BHK-21 cells or intestinal epithelium. Additional studies are needed to understand this feature. The virions were double layered with a mean diameter of 82 nm, in concordance with the reported size for MRVs (11) but larger than the reported sizes of 70 to 72 nm for bat orthoreoviruses (20, 27). Size differences in MRV particle forms, such as virions, intermediate subvirion particles (ISVPs), and core particles, have been reported (11). Viral factories with paracrystalline arrays of virions in infected Vero cells are an important characteristic of these strains, unlike the tubular viral factories seen in T3D type strains (11). Interestingly, in infected intestinal villous epithelial cells of young pigs, the virions fuse cells and egress by lysis or by using microvilli. Reovirus egress from infected cells is not completely understood (11). Our results suggest that MRV3 may use intestinal microvilli to release complete virions as arrays in addition to cell lysis.",

The sequencing data from two selected porcine MRV3 isolates (one each from feces and blood meal) revealed a high sequence homology, thus strongly suggesting that blood meal could be a possible mode of transmission along with other undetermined modes. The thermostability of these MRV3 strains at 56, 80, and 90\u00b0C for 1 h lends further credence to this notion. Ring drying of blood meal entails coagulation of blood by heating to 90\u00b0C, which may not be sufficient to inactivate these heat-resistant MRV3 strains. The current European Union regulation for pig blood products for use in pig feeds (EU 483/2014)\u2014that they must have been treated at 80\u00b0C and kept in storage for 2 weeks at room temperature to inactivate PEDV\u2014may not be sufficient to inactivate porcine MRV3. The genome sequences of the 10 segments of these strains revealed interesting features in combination like never before, making them unique and novel. For example, they carry specific mutations in \u03c31 protein that would impart trypsin resistance (28) and neurotropism (29, 30), in \u03bc2 protein for interferon antagonism (31), and possessed multiple basic residues in \u03c31s protein for hematogenous dissemination (11). The observed nine unique amino acid substitutions on the \u03bc1 protein may have a role in conferring thermostability to these strains as specific amino acid residues in \u03bc1 have been associated with thermostability in T3-type strains (32).",

The reproducibility of severe diarrhea and clinical disease with mortality in experimentally infected piglets with isolated MRV3 confirms the pathogenic nature of these strains. Villous blunting is a consistent feature of piglets affected by neonatal diarrhea syndrome (3, 38). The observed protein casts in the renal tubules and mild hepatic lipidosis could be attributed to the metabolic disorder. The presence of isoleucine at position 249 probably prevented the cleavage of \u03c31 protein by intestinal luminal proteases, enabling efficient viral growth and migration to other tissues (10) compared to the trypsin-sensitive \u03c31 protein (threonine at 249) in endemic T3D type strains with attenuated virulence (39). Previous studies with mice also indicated that reovirus virulence correlates strongly with the age of the host (40).

It is tempting to speculate that PEDV and porcine MRV3 were introduced together into the domestic swine industry based on the cocirculation of these viruses and the genetic distance of the bat origin MRV3 to circulating strains in the United States. However, with the limited number of bat MRV3 and porcine orthoreovirus sequences available to compare, the epidemiological link remains to be identified. Similarly, a large-scale epidemiological study on the prevalence of this virus in U.S. swine farms with or without diarrhea is warranted to definitively incriminate MRV3 as either the primary causative agent or coagent of the current porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks. Continued surveillance and development of preventive and control measures against MRV3 would ease the economic burden of diarrheal disease in the swine industry. The availability of cell culture and the developing chicken embryo for isolation and propagation of these viruses would greatly enhance the development of vaccines and diagnostics for MRV3-induced disease in the United States.",
