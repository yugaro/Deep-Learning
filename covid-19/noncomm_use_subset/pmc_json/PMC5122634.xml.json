In particular, subtypes 229E and OC43 are known to cause upper respiratory illness with relatively mild symptoms or even asymptomatic infections; however, these two subtypes still heavily impact the elderly and patients with cardiopulmonary disease.5",

After about five weeks, HCoV began to be detected in our pediatric patients. It is difficult to determine the reason for the delayed HCoV detection in LRTIs, compared to that in general lower respiratory infections. This study is based on the respiratory virus infection data of the KCDC, which examines references weekly. These references are obtained from the sputum of adults and children who visit primary medical centers due to respiratory infection symptoms, not only for lower but also upper respiratory infection symptoms. This means that those viruses are thought to be the pathogens of the upper respiratory infection, as shown in Fig. 2. In general, respiratory viruses are spread by children who attend school. They transmit them to adults or infants and young children. In light on this result, we predict that when respiratory infections due to HCoV increase in primary care settings, as reported weekly by the KCDC, lower respiratory infections due to HCoV in children will increase within a few weeks.",

Similar to other studies, we found the most common co-infection respiratory virus with HCoV was RSV.18 According to our data, bronchiolitis with airway obstruction is due to RSV not HCoV. On the other hand, HCoV induces pneumonia rather than bronchiolitis. This result was similar to that of previous studies.1011 Therefore, when caring the lower respiratory tract infection in the season when RSV and HCoV are both common, we should predict the causative virus. If bronchiolitis is the main presentation, RSV should be predicted, and if pneumonia is the main presentation, then HCoV should be predicted.",
