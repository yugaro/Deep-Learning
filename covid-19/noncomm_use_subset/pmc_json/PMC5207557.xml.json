In humans, they give rise to a spectrum of illnesses called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HCPS carries a mortality rate of 40%, whereas the mortality in HFRS is lower (0.4%\u201315%), but the incidence of HFRS is substantially higher. Classically, HFRS occurs in 5 distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent. Capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are the key elements in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Specific treatment is not available for hantavirus infection.[1]",

Plasma was then separated, further centrifuged at 13,000g for 2 minutes, and frozen at \u2212700C. Blood sampling and processing of plasma were in accordance with the instructions of ZYMYPHEN MP-Activity ELISA (ANIARA, HYPHEN BioMed, West Chester, OH) that was applied for analyses. The MP- Activity test kit is a functional assay measuring procoagulant activity of MPs derived from various cellular sources.[12] In the assay, circulating MPs in the plasma sample bind to Annexin V on the microplate surface and expose their phospholipid surface, which allows prothrombin activation by factor Xa and Va complex in the presence of calcium. The exposed phospholipid concentration reflects the amount of thrombin generation, which is measured using specific thrombin substrate. According the manufacturer, concentration of MPs in normal plasma is usually \u22645 nmol/L (expressed as phophatidylserine equivalent).",

Elevated platelet indices MPV and IPF% imply that bone marrow response to the TPO stimulus is adequate, and decreased platelet count observed during the acute phase of the disease is contributed by factors other than impaired platelet production. The association of high TPO with decreased platelet functions measured both with PFA-100 and Multiplate was observed during thrombocytopenia. It suggests that active thrombopoiesis, though able to provide with clinical hemostasis, is not sufficient to overcome the diminished functional capacity noted in vitro. TPO did not associate with AKI, the major outcome of HFRS. The markedly increased F1 + 2 and d-dimer further support the idea of platelet consumption in the vasculature by ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. Their association with variables reflecting AKI is a novel finding in Finnish PUUV-patients, but in line with a previous observation of high d-dimer under severe disease condition in Swedish patients.[3] We could not detect any increase in MPs\u2019 procoagulant activity during acute PUUV infection. That finding, however, needs to be explored in more detail, but MPs have been shown to bind to fibrin surfaces,[13] which may be the case during the hantavirus infection.",

That was, however, the finding only among patients with mild kidney injury. In this study, increased thrombin formation (F1 + 2) and fibrinolysis (d-dimer) associated with the severity of AKI, and the attachment of platelet-derived MPs to fibrin clots especially in patients with more severe kidney injury could plausibly explain our observation.[13,28] Preanalytical measures as well as analytical methods in the detection of MPs\u2019 activity are crucial[29] and even if the instructions of the ELISA-assay manufacturer were vigorously followed, the issues regarding methodology cannot be completely excluded.[12] The sample size of the study was, though not large but probably sufficient, as the difference of serum TPO level in the acute phase of the disease compared with the recovery could be verified. MPs\u2019 procoagulant activity did not associate with any of the variables depicting disease severity, and it failed to predict clinical outcome in this group of patients with acute Puumala hantavirus infection.",
