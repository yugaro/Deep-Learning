            "text": "Because chronic inflammation in the lung increases with aging (MacNee, 2011) and AM and rDC (CD11c+ cells) are critical for maintaining lung homeostasis and for prostaglandin production, we initially examined CD11c+ cells harvested from young and middle-aged mice for global changes in gene expression. Expression levels of 186 genes changed during aging, with many involved in antigen presentation and inflammation (Fig. 1 B and Table S1). Many of these were predicted to contribute to a chronic inflammatory response. However, our previous study showed that levels of a prostaglandin with antiinflammatory properties, PGD2, were elevated in aged mice (confirmed in Fig. 1 A) and contributed to poor outcomes after SARS-CoV infection (Zhao et al., 2011). Therefore, we next focused on genes involved in the AA pathway, including several phospholipases, cyclooxygenases, and synthases, which could modulate PGD2 levels in the lungs. Of all the genes in the AA cascade, only levels of secreted phospholipase A2 group IID (PLA2G2D) were significantly higher in CD11c+ cells in the lungs of middle-aged compared with young mice (using twofold differences as a cutoff; Fig. 1, C and D). We confirmed these results by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses of CD11c+ cell RNA by separating CD11c+ and CD11c\u2212 cells from the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice using magnetic beads and quantifying the expression of PLA2G2D mRNA (Fig. 2 A). We observed 25\u201330 fold higher expression of PLA2G2D mRNA in lung CD11c+ compared with CD11c\u2212 cells from middle-aged mice. Comparison of CD11c+ cells from young and middle-aged mice revealed that PLA2G2D was expressed at levels >50-fold higher in middle-aged mice (Fig. 2 A). Flow cytometric analysis also showed higher expression of PLA2G2D in CD11c+ compared with CD11c\u2212 cells on a per cell basis in both young and middle-aged mice, as measured by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; Fig. 2 B). In addition, middle-aged mice harbored a higher frequency of CD11c+ cells expressing PLA2G2D compared with young mice (Fig. 2 C).",

However, regulatory T cells (T reg cells; CD4+FoxP3+) have been implicated as a source for PLA2G2D in previous studies (von Allmen et al., 2009) and lungs of uninfected middle-aged mice harbor higher frequency and number of T reg cells compared with young mice (Fig. 2 D). To address whether T reg cells are an additional source for PLA2G2D, we depleted CD4 T cells, which includes T reg cells, from middle-aged mice and analyzed lungs for expression of PLA2G2D. We observed no changes in the mRNA expression of PLA2G2D after CD4 T cell depletion (Fig. 2 E), suggesting that CD4 T cells, including T reg cells, are not a major source of PLA2G2D in the lungs.",

However, this was not the case because levels of PLA2G2D were significantly higher in unfractionated lung mRNA from middle-aged compared with young mice. Notably, PLA2G2D levels were even higher in samples obtained from aged (22 mo) mice (Fig. 3 A). Assessment of other genes in the AA cascade generally confirmed the microarray results shown in Fig. 1 C and showed that there were no differences in the levels of expression of the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2 or other PLA2s (PLA2G2E, PLA2G3, PLA2G4, PLA2G5, and PLA2G10) as mice aged (Fig. 3, B and C). One exception is that there were significantly higher mRNA levels of hematopoietic PGD2 synthase (HPGDS), which is important for PGD2 production and could contribute to elevated PGD2 levels in the lungs of middle-aged compared with young mice (Fig. 3 C; Murata et al., 2013).",

However, unlike in the lungs, there were no age-dependent differences in PLA2G2D mRNA expression in MLN CD11c+ cells between young and middle-aged naive mice.

Hence, we reasoned that higher expression levels of PLA2G2D in the lungs of middle-aged mice would result in perturbation in lipid metabolism and that lipid mediators with proresolving functions, other than PGD2, would also be produced at higher levels. To investigate this possibility, we performed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to determine the levels of free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as their oxygenated metabolites, including PGD2, in the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice (Fig. 4, B\u2013D). Initial analyses revealed altered profiles of lipid mediators with both pro- and antiinflammatory function in the lungs of middle-aged relative to young mice. Levels of free PUFA such as AA (\u03c96) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; \u03c93) were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was higher in middle-aged mice relative to young mice (Fig. 4 B). AA metabolites with antiinflammatory (PGE2 and PGD2) and proinflammatory properties (PGF2\u03b1 and Thromboxane [TX] B2 [a TXA2 metabolite]) were produced at higher levels in the lungs of middle-aged mice compared with young mice, but levels of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 (a PGI2 metabolite) did not differ between the groups (Fig. 4, C and D).",

            "text": "PLA2G2D is one of many PLA2 expressed in the lungs, but is the only one that was up-regulated as mice aged, as shown above. Therefore, we next assessed whether PLA2G2D mediated the perturbation in pulmonary lipid profile in middle-aged mice using Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 and Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Miki et al., 2013). Lipid profiling of the lungs of middle-aged Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 and Pla2g2d+/+ mice revealed an important role for PLA2G2D in the levels of most lipids examined (Fig. 4, H\u2013J). Of note, these changes were not observed when young Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 and Pla2g2d+/+ mice were compared (Fig. 4, E\u2013G). AA was produced at lower levels in Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 relative to Pla2g2d+/+ middle-aged mice (Fig. 4 H), suggesting that phospholipase activity required to release AA was at least partly dependent on PLA2G2D. Levels of 6ketoPGF1\u03b1, TXB2, PGF2\u03b1, PGD2, and PGE2 were also higher in the lungs of Pla2g2d+/+ compared with Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4, I and J), suggesting that differences in AA levels resulted in differences in the levels of its downstream metabolites, some of which have antiinflammatory function (PGD2 and PGE2; Vancheri et al., 2004; Kalinski, 2012; Murata et al., 2013). The results also identify PLA2G2D-dependent pools of two other PUFA, DHA, and EPA in the lungs. DHA and EPA are further metabolized largely into proresolving mediators, such as resolvin D1, protectin D1, and resolvin E1 among others (Arita et al., 2005; Rogerio et al., 2012).",

We initially analyzed mice infected with SARS-CoV because middle-aged but not young C57BL/6 mice succumb to infection with this virus, mimicking the human disease (Fig. 5 A; Frieman et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). Because mortality in middle-aged mice begins at 4 d after SARS-CoV infection, we investigated whether levels of lipid mediators, including PGD2, changed at this time. Expression levels of PLA2G2D increased in both young and middle-aged mice after infection (Fig. 5 B). Further, pulmonary lipid profiling on day 4 postinfection (p.i.) revealed significant increases in lung levels of free PUFAs such as AA, EPA, and DHA in middle-aged mice but less so in young mice (Fig. 5 C). Levels of lipid mediators with proinflammatory activity, 6ketoPGF1\u03b1, TXB2, and PGF2\u03b1, increased in the lungs of young but not middle-aged mice after SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, levels of PGE2 and PGD2, both of which have antiinflammatory activity in the lungs, increased in both young and middle-aged mice after infection (Fig. 5 E).",

Whereas levels of free PUFAs, AA, DHA, and EPA increased in the lungs of both groups of mice during infection, Pla2g2d+/+ mice harbored higher levels of all three fatty acids at all times examined (Fig. 5 F), indicating that the inducible pool of each of these fatty acids was at least partly mediated by PLA2G2D. We did not observe an infection-dependent increase in the levels of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1, TXB2, or PGF2\u03b1 in either group of mice, although levels remained higher in Pla2g2d+/+ mice relative to Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 p.i.

These results indicate multifactorial regulation of the inducible AA cascade with basal levels of all lipid mediators were maintained at least partly by PLA2G2D, whereas increases in PGE2 and PGD2 levels observed after SARS-CoV infection in the lungs were largely dependent on PLA2G2D. These data also agree with published studies showing that induction of PLA2G2D generated pools of proresolving but not proinflammatory mediators in the lung and skin in the context of allergic disease (Nagao et al., 2003; Kunikata et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2012; Miki et al., 2013).",

PLA2G2D was required for MHCII but not CD40 or CD80 expression on lung CD11c+ cells in middle-aged mice, and for increased frequency but not number of cells expressing TNF in the absence of any direct ex vivo stimulation with TLR ligands. CD11c+ cells from both Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mouse lungs were able to express equivalent amounts of TNF after direct ex vivo stimulation (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, these results indicate that CD11c+ cells from infected middle-aged Pla2g2d+/+ mice were more highly activated in vivo compared with young C57BL/6 mice, but that PLA2G2D has a relatively minor role in age-dependent differences in CD11c+ cell maturation and function.",

To determine whether this was the case, we first instilled OVA-FITC intranasally (i.n.) into uninfected middle-aged Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice and analyzing MLN 18 h later for OVA-FITC+ rDCs, indicative of migration from the lungs. We observed that a higher frequency and number of rDCs migrated to the MLN in the absence of PLA2G2D (Fig. 6 F). We next investigated whether rDC migration was augmented in mice infected with SARS-CoV by instilling CFSE i.n. into middle-aged Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice 6 h before infection. 18 h p.i. MLN were harvested and analyzed for the frequency of rDCs that migrated from lungs (CD11c+MHCII+CFSE+ population). Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice harbored a higher frequency and number of CFSE+ rDCs in MLN compared with Pla2g2d +/+ mice (Fig. 6 G). Migration of DCs from the site of infection to the MLN is mediated by chemokine receptor CCR7 binding to CCL19/21 (Hamilton-Easton and Eichelberger, 1995; Fainaru et al., 2005) and DCs differentiated in the presence of PGD2 express lower levels of CCR7 (Gosset et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2011). Consistent with higher expression of PLA2G2D and PGD2 in the lungs, Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 rDCs expressed higher CCR7 surface levels than Pla2g2d+/+ rDCs, contributing to enhanced rDC migration to the draining lymph nodes in uninfected and SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice (Fig. 6 H).",

We addressed this possibility by examining the CD4 and CD8 T cell response in SARS-CoV\u2013infected middle-aged Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 and Pla2g2d+/+ mice. A higher frequency and number of virus-specific (epitope S525-specific) CD8 T cell and (epitope N110-specific) CD4 T cells (Fig. 7 A) were present in the lungs of Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with Pla2g2d+/+ mice. In addition, we also observed that CD8 T cells from Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 compared with Pla2g2d+/+ mice produced more IFN-\u03b3 on a per cell basis (Fig. 7 B), although there were no differences in the fraction of CD8 T cells that produced both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF (Fig. 7 C). Further, the absence of PLA2G2D augmented CD8 T cell cytolytic activity, measured in an in vivo killing assay (Fig. 7 D). To investigate if there was also a T cell\u2013intrinsic defect in Pla2g2d+/+ mice, we performed a set of adoptive transfer experiments, transferring splenocytes from uninfected Pla2g2d+/+ or Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice to CD45 disparate Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 or Pla2g2d+/+ mice, respectively, before SARS-CoV infection. In each case, the frequency of transferred CD8 T cells that expressed IFN-\u03b3 after peptide stimulation was similar to that of endogenous cells, indicating that the defects were T cell extrinsic (Fig. 7 E).",

Both the frequency and number of rDCs were increased in the MLN of Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 compared with Pla2g2d+/+ mice when assessed at 18 h p.i. (Fig. 9 A).

Enhancement of the CD8 T cell response did not increase survival in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 9 C).

A consequence of lipid peroxidation is increased expression of various PLA2s (Brown et al., 2003), raising the possibility that increased oxidative stress in the middle-aged lung is a key factor in PLA2G2D up-regulation. To evaluate whether oxidative stress is increased in the lungs of middle-aged mice, we first measured the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, and an indicator of oxidative stress (Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990). Analyses of middle-aged compared with young mice revealed higher lung concentrations of MDA (Imai et al., 2008), indicative of greater pulmonary oxidative stress (Fig. 10 A).",

Further, to induce oxidative stress in young mice, we treated them for seven days with a low dose of LPS (0.1 \u00b5g/mouse; Kratzer et al., 2012). This dose has been shown to result in low level induction of proinflammatory mediators in murine macrophages (Maitra et al., 2012). Chronic LPS treatment resulted in higher concentrations of MDA in the lungs of mice compared with controls (Fig. 10 C). More importantly, inducing oxidative stress with LPS also increased mRNA levels of PLA2G2D (Fig. 10 C), but not of other PLA2s (PLA2G4, PLA2G2E, PLA2G10; Fig. 10 D) in lung CD11c+ cells.",

PLA2G2D expression was then assessed. In agreement with previous work (Miki et al., 2013), LPS exposure for 1 d did not result in increased PLA2G2D levels (unpublished data). However, we observed increased PLA2G2D expression after chronic LPS treatment (10 d), and this was accompanied by increases in MDA levels, indicative of higher oxidative stress (Fig. 10 E).

SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice also show similar steep age-dependent changes in mortality, which we show is due, in large part, to increases in levels of a single secretory PLA2, PLA2G2D, as mice age. A hallmark of aging is lipid peroxidation and subsequent up-regulation of PLA2s (Brown et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2004; Hermann et al., 2014) and our results suggest that, in the lungs, levels of PLA2G2D singularly increase as mice age. PLA2G2D is considered an antiinflammatory/proresolving enzyme, suggesting its up-regulation is actually a measure used in the lung to counter the low-grade chronic inflammation that occurs with aging (Franceschi et al., 2000; Miki et al., 2013). In support of this notion, treatment with low doses of LPS, which induces oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, resulted in PLA2G2D up-regulation both in CD11c+ cells in the mouse lung (Fig. 10 C) and in human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 10 E). Further, interventions that diminish reactive oxygen species decreased PLA2G2D expression (Fig. 10 B). A recent study demonstrated the proresolving role of PLA2G2D in the setting of contact dermatitis in mice; in its absence, resolution was prolonged (Miki et al., 2013). PLA2G2D would be expected to have similar effects in ameliorating disease in the context of autoimmune disease.",

Activation of the PGD2\u2013DP1 signaling axis on rDCs results in decreased CCR7 expression so that DP1 antagonism results in augmented rDC migration to the draining LN in uninfected and SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice (Hammad et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2011). Of note, inhibition of DC migration by PGD2/DP1 signaling is not confined to the lung, because, after skin invasion, Schistoma mansonii releases PGD2 to inhibit Langerhans cell migration to the draining LN, delaying the initial immune response (Angeli et al., 2001). Similar effects are observed in Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with either SARS-CoV or IAV, resulting in enhanced T cell responses (Fig. 7, A, B, and D, and 9 B) and, in the case of SARS-CoV, improved survival (Fig. 8 A). In addition, PGD2 can also mediate its antiinflammatory effects through binding of 15d-PGJ2, a dehydration end product of PGD2, to a nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3 (Hilliard et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Although we primarily focused on the role of PLA2G2D in increased PGD2 production, PLA2G2D is critical for the synthesis of additional antiinflammatory/proresolving molecules. PUFA\u2013oxygenated metabolites with dedicated proresolving activities, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins (also called specialized proresolving mediators [SPMs]), are derived from \u03c93 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA (Serhan et al., 2002; Buckley et al., 2014; Serhan, 2014). PLA2G2D is known to release free PUFAs into a substrate pool that can be further mobilized to produce proresolving lipid mediators such as DHA-derived resolvin D1 and EPA-derived resolvin E1 among many others (Serhan et al., 2002; Miki et al., 2013). Notably, EPA levels were higher in the lungs of uninfected middle-aged compared with young mice (Fig. 4 B), and both EPA and DHA production were higher in uninfected and infected Pla2g2d+/+ mice compared with their Pla2g2d\u2212/\u2212 counterparts (Figs. 4 H and 5 F). However we failed to detect any resolvins or protectins, the downstream metabolites of EPA or DHA in the lungs of mice, possibly reflecting low levels of these molecules in lung tissue. Notably, although EPA is higher in middle-aged compared with young lungs (DHA is nearing to significance; P = 0.12; Fig. 4 B), SPMs are lower in the uninflamed peritoneum of aged compared with young mice (Arnardottir et al., 2014), suggesting that age-dependent differences in baseline levels of these molecules are organ-specific and could possibly contribute to disease-specific outcomes.",

This specific effect of aging on pulmonary CD11c+ cells may reflect constant exposure to airborne antigens, most of which are innocuous. An immune response to these antigens would be undesirable and would contribute to allergic reactions and asthma. In contrast, PLA2G2D in lymph nodes might be expected to have a different role, namely to down-regulate proinflammatory responses, and thereby contribute to resolution of the immune response after pathogen control or allergic or autoimmune reactions.",

            "text": "A key question is why SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice are especially affected by age-dependent changes in PLA2G2D expression. One unique feature of SARS is that maximal virus titers in mouse lungs are detected within 24 h after infection (Fett et al., 2013), nearly coincident with the time of maximal migration of rDCs from the lungs to the DLNs. Furthermore, coronavirus replication results in extensive membrane remodeling with the formation of double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, the sites of viral RNA synthesis and assembly (Novoa et al., 2005; Knoops et al., 2008; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008). This virus-induced reorganization of the host cell membrane causes the accumulation of cone-shaped lipids, specifically lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; Escrib\u00e1 et al., 1997; Lee and Ahlquist, 2003; Diaz et al., 2010; Lorizate and Kr\u00e4usslich, 2011; Xu and Nagy, 2015). Because PLA2G2D specifically mobilizes PE to release AA and DHA (Miki et al., 2013), robust replication of SARS-CoV during the first 24 h of infection likely increases the amount of PLA2G2D substrate. Additionally, LPC and PE may form large lipid aggregates; most secreted phospholipases, including PLA2G2D, exhibit a tendency to show increased activity when the substrate is presented in this form (Carman et al., 1995; Gelb et al., 1995). Thus, SARS-CoV infection results in enhanced release of AA into the eicosanoid pathway, which increases the concentration of PGD2 and downstream products of EPA and DHA, further dampening the immune response. Notably, similar processes may occur in patients with MERS-CoV infections, who also exhibit age-dependent increases in susceptibility (Assiri et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2014; Alsolamy, 2015).",

            "text": "In conclusion, it is likely that in the absence of challenge with a pathogen such as SARS-CoV, elevated PLA2G2D expression benefits the host by increasing the level of various immunosuppressive lipid mediators such as PGD2, thereby dampening the response to environmental antigens. However in the context of an infection, the higher basal levels of PGD2 and other proresolving lipid mediators adversely affect the initiation of a protective innate immune response and ultimately adaptive immune response (Fig. 10 E). Thus, therapeutic interventions that increase the levels of proresolving lipid mediators might have undesirable effects in the context of infection. However, these results also suggest that PLA2G2D would serve as a useful therapeutic target in the lungs of patients after infection with SARS-CoV and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens, including MERS-CoV. Short-term targeting of a single inducible PLA2 would avoid undesirable effects that might be observed by generalized inhibition of PLA2 function. Such drugs have been developed for some PLA2s (Oslund et al., 2008), although not yet for PLA2G2D, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.",
