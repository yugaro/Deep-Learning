On the other hand, programs to increase awareness of bats being carriers of serious pathogens have not been established in Indonesia. With respect to the risk of human exposure to pathogens carried by\nbats in Thailand, Robertson et al. found that only a small proportion (11%) of people consider bats a potential source of rabies [25]. Although 27% of participants in that\nstudy had a history of being bitten or scratched by a bat, 36% of them took no action or did not know what to do in such cases.
