            "text": "Viruses show appreciable variation in the selectivity with which they infect host organisms. Some viruses infect a broad range of species, whereas others infect only a single host. A successful viral infection requires that the virus possess the capability to enter the host cell and take over cellular functions and direct them toward the efficient production of new viruses. Most viruses recognize their respective hosts through membrane receptors that have a role in host physiology. Examples of such receptors are gangliosides, heparan sulfate moieties, and integrins (Garrigues et al, 2008), which act as the cell receptors for simian virus 40 (SV40), human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), respectively. In stark contrast, for some viruses, host range is not limited to the recognition stage (McFadden, 2005). For example, poxviruses bind to and enter a wide range of mammalian cells, but a fruitful replication cycle occurs only in a restricted set of hosts. Replication of poxviruses involves the host cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription factors, phosphatases, and interferon-induced mediators. Therefore, the features that govern the host range for poxvirus seem to involve a rich collection of host genes (McFadden, 2005).",

            "text": "The degeneracy of the genetic code implies that multiple triplets code for the same amino acid. The frequencies with which different codons are used vary significantly between organisms and between proteins within the same organism (Akashi, 2001). Many studies have focused on the bias in codon usage among species. In single cell organisms (prokaryotes, archaea, and some fungi), the codon usage is strongly tuned for highly expressed genes and was thus concluded to be optimized for translational efficiency (Sharp et al, 1988). However, the main trends in multicellular organism codon usage were attributed to the isochore-dependent genome composition (GC) content, gene architecture, and chromosomal locations (see discussion in Costantini et al, 2009). Still, evidence for codon usage bias toward highly expressed genes and its correlation to tRNA abundance argues that translational efficiency does have a role for some plant, fly, and worm proteomes (Duret, 2000 and references within). Evolutionary forces and multiple molecular processes (e.g., unbiased gene conversion, mutation rates, and genetic drift) have also participated in shaping codon usage in higher eukaryotes (Bernardi, 1986; Duret, 2002). The molecular determinants that have globally influenced the translational efficiency in Escherichia coli (Kudla et al, 2009) and the evolution of polymerase genes in the influenza A virus (Brower-Sinning et al, 2009) indicate that, in addition to GC content, RNA folding processes also affect the adaptability and translational capacity of viral sequences.",

An exception is the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus, which contains a partial set of tRNAs and other host-like properties (Van Etten and Meints, 1999). In a recent study that tested the codon usage adaptation for over 100 bacteriophages infecting 10 different bacterial hosts, it was shown that the bacteriophage genomes are under codon-selective pressure imposed by the translational biases of their respective hosts (Carbone, 2008). The reasoning underlying this codon selection hypothesis argues that it provides an advantage for viral protein synthesis at the level of translational efficiency.",

            "text": "In viruses infecting multicellular animals, such translational biases may lead to increased virion production rates within the infected cell and reduce the accessibility of viruses to the immune response of the host (Bonhoeffer and Nowak, 1994). However, to the best of our knowledge, the analysis of codon biases of eukaryotic (alongside prokaryotic) viruses compared with their hosts has yet to be undertaken on a large scale. However, related phenomena have been described. Specifically, the codon usage bias in the poxviridae family (dsDNA viruses) was determined by measuring the effective number of codons in the viral proteome. Neither the expression level nor the gene size was shown to be a determinant of the measured codon usage biases. Nonetheless, for most poxviruses, the codon usage was close to the value predicted based on the GC content (Barrett et al, 2006). Similar results were shown for coronavirus (Gu et al, 2004) and other vertebrate-infecting DNA viruses (Shackelton et al, 2006). In papillomavirus, the codon bias was attributed to the AT content rather than to host specificity (Zhao et al, 2003). In the case of retroviruses, it was shown that strong discrimination against CpG sequences directly shapes the codon usage and, as a result, even indirectly restricts the choice of amino acids (Berkhout et al, 2002). Thus, in general, GC and, specifically, the GC content were thus far found to be the major determinants of codon usage in vertebrate DNA viruses (Shackelton et al, 2006).",

To this end, we provide a strict virus-to-host mapping using a non-redundant set of representative viruses and hosts, ranging from human to bacteria. We develop a statistical framework for the unbiased assessment of the mutual pairwise distances between all viruses and all recognized hosts. To test the hypothesis of general molecular adaptation of a virus toward its hosts, we focus on codon usage and amino acid preferences within groups of viruses that are unified at varying taxonomical granularities. We observe that all bacteriophages are strongly tuned to match their unique hosts and this correspondence is also evident in their GC contents. However, somewhat surprisingly, viruses that infect humans resemble all mammalian hosts equally, and this similarity even extends to aves and several insects. This observation does not hold for viruses of other mammals, despite a strong similarity among the codon usages of most mammals. Finally, we show that viral selection of codon usage toward that of the host has not occurred uniformly for all proteins of the virus, but it is mainly dominated by the set of proteins expressed in high abundance. The implications of these observations for viral evolution and on the potential for zoonotic epidemics are discussed.",

Currently, \u223c10% of all sequences in the UniProtKB database (Boutet et al, 2007) (release 14.6) are viral proteins (718 000 proteins). Actually, full-length proteins account for only a third of these, and, following the elimination of sequence redundancy (at the level of 90% identity), the number of proteins is reduced to only \u223c10% of the original number (72 992 proteins) (Figure 1). In addition, the low fraction of these proteins that are manually reviewed (based on the SwissProt database) results in only 1% of the initial collection (7416 proteins). Furthermore, the relevance of specific virus families to human health has led to a strong bias in the quality and reliability of genome annotation. The majority of viral sequences in the public databases are derived from only a few viral families, whereas most families remain poorly represented. This point is illustrated for the HIV, which makes up 36% of all viral protein entries (Figure 1). Half of all viral proteins are either from the HIV or hepatitis (Hepadnaviridae) viruses, two families with an indisputable impact on human health. An additional source of bias in analyzing the viral world stems from data that originate from incomplete genomes. The UniProtKB annotation of \u2018complete proteome' covers only 0.5% of all viral sequences.",

ViralZone lists \u223c300 genera of viruses belonging to 80 major families. Associated with each genus is information on the host range and tissue tropism. All viruses are classified by their taxonomical order as well as by the accepted index that divides them into seven classes (Baltimore index I\u2013VII), based on their genetic material and mode of replication. One hundred twenty-one human-infecting viruses that belong to 50 genera are currently known (Supplementary Table S1). The uneven partition for human-infecting viruses among the seven classes is shown (Figure 1B). Class I (dsDNA) and class V (ssRNA(\u2212)) account for 70% of the proteins, but all other classes are also represented among human viruses. By considering all proteins that are known from UniProtKB (a unification of SwissProt and TrEMBL), only 25% of the relevant proteomes are included in classes I and V, whereas the dominating class in terms of the quantity of protein sequences is class VI (ssRNA (RT), including HIV). Proteins belonging to class IV account for \u223c50% of the proteins of human-infecting viruses (total \u223c568 000). We used the manually compiled set from SwisProt for analyzing the human viruses throughout this study. Thus, in summary, we chose to focus only on complete proteomes of the representative species to ensure an unbiased and unabridged data set for subsequent analysis, as an uneven representation of viral protein sequences will affect most statistical properties (e.g., codon usage, GC content, and amino acid composition).",

To start with, we focused on two taxonomical groups: mammals (subdivided into human and nonhuman hosts) and bacteria. This analysis is based on 481 779 and 312 201 amino acids from the respective virus groups. The proteomes of virus representatives that infect humans and those that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) are compared (Figure 3A). It is evident that some amino acids strongly deviate between these two groups. For example, arginine (R) is more prevalent in the viruses of humans (P<10\u22126, t-test with Bonferroni correction), whereas lysine (K) appears more in bacterial proteomes (P<10\u22126). A similar trend is seen for isoleucine (I, P<10\u22126) and leucine (L, P<10\u22126). The source and biological significance of such differences are under study and beyond the scope of this study.",

However, no significant associations are found between the GC contents of viruses and their hosts for other taxonomic groups. For example, for the 11 mammals analyzed in this study, the correlation was extremely poor (R2=0.065). This can be explained by the fact that although the GC content in mammal-infecting viruses ranges between 35 and 56%, the GC content of the proteomes of the mammal hosts studied (Supplementary Table S3) is rather narrow (50\u201353%).

We have shown that human viruses show an unexpected similarity to a broad range of host taxonomical groups, including mammals, avians, most insects, and some plants.

Clearly, our analyses are strongly dependent on the correct mapping of viruses to their hosts. We analyzed 122 viruses at the higher taxonomical levels and 64 viruses at the host-species level, where each such virus represents a different viral genus (Table I; Supplementary Table S2). By the strict mapping of a set of 30 virus genera that exclusively infect 30 different hosts, we limited the set of viruses and often remained with only one or very few representatives for a unique host. It is possible that the set of viruses that have a restricted range of hosts is skewed. They may reflect (i) poorly studied cases, which leads to partial information regarding the virus and its hosts; and (ii) cases where the dependency on virus\u2013host pair is stronger because of a specific molecular barrier that restricts the host range. We cannot separate these two instances, but for many cases the restricted host assignment is supported by a large body of literature. For example, the observed overwhelming similarity in amino acid distributions and in the codon usage among viruses infecting the tomato, lettuce, rice, and arabidopsis plants (Figure 4) seems more likely to be a result of incomplete annotation in the viral database, where each of these viruses overlap and, in reality, infect the other plants but are simply not yet annotated as such. This is in accord with the current view of plant-infecting viruses (Roossinck, 1997). Although the statistical power for some analyses may be affected by this \u2018reduction to representatives,' we argue that the trends observed in this study hold and will be further substantiated when additional viruses with accurate annotations become available.",

Yet we do not believe this phenomenon to be a major determinant in codon usage adaptation as (i) it is unlikely that the codon usage of some functional groups but not of the entire proteome will show differences in the patterns observed (Figure 7C); (ii) there is no evidence that among the mammals we tested here some are more likely to be affected by LGT than others, yet human viruses show a significantly different pattern than other mammals; (iii) different classes of viruses (class I\u2013VII) have similar adaptation trends, despite substantial differences in the potential for the exchange of genetic material with the host in RNA and DNA viruses.

In the case of human viruses, we can see that highly expressed genes in different viruses that infect the same host preferentially use codons similar to that of humans and of each other (Figure 7C). On the other hand, the surface proteins that participate in recognition are often expressed in lower quantities displaying a rather low adaptation level toward their hosts (marked \u2018R'). A complementary explanation may rely on the positive selection paradigm that was proposed in virus\u2013host recognition (Sawyer et al, 2005). The enzymes (marked \u2018EC'), which are generally expressed in minute amounts, show only an intermediate codon usage similarity. Thus, overall, these results further strengthen the case for translational selection. Note that earlier studies did not find evidence for translational selection operating on mammalian genes (see discussion in (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009; Semon et al, 2006 #544) and references within). It may be possible that such selection does exist, but these phenomena are weak because of the low effective mammalian population sizes. On the other hand, viruses affecting mammals have larger effective population sizes and a shorter generation time (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009). Thus, similar analysis to that performed here may be able to identify translational selection in genomes in which it was impossible to do so earlier.",

Our results agree with a role of translational selection and extend it toward mammalian viruses, where it may have a role in their evolutionary fitness. However, this adaptation may be of lesser importance, as a critical obstacle for viruses that infect mammals is the need to invade their host cells, while bypassing an active immune system (whereas no such extensive system exists in bacterial hosts). For example, the HIV virus has adopted recognition strategies that overcome the immune barrier (Holmes et al, 1992).",

Such a shift occurs through a genetic adaptation process that overcomes the hurdles of viral entry and replication in a new cellular environment. \u03a6X174 bacteriophage, which normally grows on E. coli, was switched to infect Salmonella, where this shift was attributed to only a very few mutations (2\u20133) in the major capsid gene (Crill et al, 2000). This phenomenon is not unique to bacterial viruses, as this has occurred in canine parvovirus, which appeared in the late 1970s as a variant of a feline parvovirus. The host shift was attributed to only two to three substitutions (Truyen et al, 1995). A shift in host recognition was also shown in the case of HIV-1, where a single mutation in the envelope gene was sufficient to alter cell specificity (Rambaut et al, 2004). In all these strategies, virus\u2013host shift is based on modifications in the virus receptor recognition step. However, it has been shown that host range is not entirely dependent on the initial recognition stage (McFadden, 2005).",

Similarly, neuroattenuated phenotype was associated with codon preference deoptimization in polioviruses (Mueller et al, 2006). In a common vaccination practice, a live, attenuated virus is produced by adaptation to a new host, thereby eliminating its virulence to humans. As we have found that human-infecting viruses have conserved and unique codon usages, we propose that a fine-tuning of codon deoptimization may allow the alteration of tissue tropism and virulence attenuation.",

Known examples of naturally occurring host\u2013virus shifts are the introduction of HIV-1 to humans in the early 1950s and the shift in the SARS (CoV) virus that crossed over to infect humans only very recently. The worldwide threat of influenza-based epidemics, such as the transmission of avian flu (Influenza A virus, H5N1) to humans and the latest outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1, April 2009) in Mexico, is heightened by the rapid evolution of the Influenza virus witnessed during the last decade; recently, H3N2 and H3N8 were introduced from humans to pigs and from horses to dogs, respectively (Campitelli et al, 1997). It is likely that the domestication and close interaction between humans, rats, and farm animals for thousands of years has led to the evolution of viruses that infect humans and are adapted toward a broad range of hosts. The similarities in codon usage and amino acid composition that we have observed in this work can somewhat relate to the potential for zoonosis. Although, as discussed above, these molecular properties are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for host shifts, our analysis can nevertheless contribute to a framework that would permit analysis of the potential of certain viruses to adapt to new host species.",

The analysis for human-infecting viruses includes 2186 proteins and for mammals (excluding humans) 513 proteins. (A) Graphical schemes of enveloped viruses (adapted from the ViralZone illustrations) are shown. Proteins that are exposed on the virus surface and are part of the host receptor recognition include proteins annotated as glycoprotein, coat, spike, and fiber (marked \u2018R', orange). Capsids, core, and structural proteins are characterized by high expression (marked \u2018H', light blue). Capsids may appear in multiple layers (intermediate and inner capsids). Other proteins expressed in large quantities include core, matrix, tegument, DNA-packing proteins, and nucleoproteins. (B) Partition of the proteomes to functional groups of surface-protein recognition (orange), structural protein with high copy number in the virion (light blue), enzymes as defined by the E.C. enzyme annotation (purple), and uncharacterized viral proteins (gray). (C) The overall similarity, as measured by L2 distance (see Materials and methods), is shown according to each of the functional partitions of proteins. Lower value indicates higher resemblance.
