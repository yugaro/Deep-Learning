About 7% to 13% of all very low birth weight (VLBW) infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) develop NEC, with a mortality range of 10% to 44%1-3), and both the incidence and mortality rate increase with decreasing birth weight and gestational age (GA). Intestine immaturity, birth asphyxia, low appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (Apgar) score, intestinal ischemic change due to umbilical artery catheterization, viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus), infection from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Clostridium difficile, and early rapid feeding are cause of NEC4-6). Some reports have indicated an association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (RBC(t)) and NEC, but this is controversial7-10). In this study, we analyzed the association between NEC and RBC(t) in VLBW preterm infants.",

Infants with stage II or greater were defined as the NEC group and those less than stage II and without NEC patients were defined as the control group. We defined that RBC(t) before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until the NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in NEC group. Therefore, the frequency of transfusion was counted until 18 days after birth in control group. We evaluated patient history, including GA, birth weight (B.wt), Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) at birth, the time from premature rupture of membrane (PROM), the use of prenatal antibiotics, intraventicular hemorrhage (IVH\u2265grade 2: identified and classified by sonographic features), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), hemorrhage history at other sites (pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and petechia), the presence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and the number of times surfactant was used, presence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), dose of indomethacin administration, time on ventilator and O2 and the presence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We investigated the NEC stage and the frequency of packed RBC(t) during the hospital course and transfusions before the NEC diagnosis for the patients with a NEC diagnosis. The decision for RBC(t) was made by the neonatologist caring for the infant and transfusion guidelines11) were followed. All transfusions were done with packed RBCs. Packed RBCs were transfused in a volume of 10 to 20 mL/kg over 2 to 4 hours.",

The latest hypotheses as to why packed RBC(t) increases the risk of NEC suggest that stored RBCs decrease nitric oxide23) and a packed RBC(t) increases the intestinal immune response24). In this study, GA and B.wt were not different between the NEC and control groups, but in the univariate logistic regression, the risk for NEC decreased significantly the higher the GA, B.wt, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Higher PDA incidences also tended to increase NEC risk, but the difference was not significant. The number of patients in the NEC group who were diagnosed within 48 hours of a transfusion was 14 and after 48 hours the number was two. Only two patients with NEC did not receive a transfusion their GA were 31 and 30 weeks and their Apgar scores at 1 minute were 1 point and 0 points. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was carried out on these infants. The Apgar score at 5 minutes recovered to 5 points for both and the infants recovered with conservative therapy after the NEC diagnosis.",
