To determine whether heterogeneous L-SIGN neck lengths affect DENV infection levels, we examined the effects of a single length repeat and compared it with cells expressing 2 different-length L-SIGN alleles simultaneously. We examined this by transient transfection, and 293T cells were used for these assays as they can be transiently transfected to a high level. 293T were transfected with L-SIGN containing 5 or 7 repeats singly or together in equal amounts. L-SIGN expression was confirmed by surface staining and flow cytometry. Equal expression of alternate-length L-SIGN constructs was also confirmed by western blotting. Transfectants were then infected with dengue virus, and infection was monitored by intracellular staining together with an antibody specific to L-SIGN to reveal transfected cells. All transfectants were equally infected with no reduction in cells expressing both L-SIGN alleles, suggesting that heterotetrameric L-SIGN was as effective as homotetrameric L-SIGN at promoting infection (Figure 5).",

In a final series of experiments we investigated whether DC-produced virus could be induced to infect primary human DCs by ADE (Figure 6B). DC-produced virus could be enhanced to infection by >20-fold, whereas the already high level of infection of DCs by insect-produced virus was not enhanced further by dengue serum.",

Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of dengue virus complexed to soluble DC-SIGN show interaction with the glycan at position 67 [33]. There have been several reports on the N-linked glycosylation of dengue envelope. Some reports suggest the use of both sites, whereas others suggest that only one is used [23, 34\u201336]. We show that in C6/36, Vero cells, and DCs either one or both sites are used for the dengue 2 serotype 16681. Although both glycosylation sites can play important roles in infectivity and viral replication, functional studies have confirmed the importance of Asn-67 for infection of DC-SIGN\u2013expressing cells [33]. WNV E protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at position 154 that is absent from some virus strains [37]. Both dengue and WNV contain a single N-linked site in prM, and although prM is cleaved by furin during viral maturation, a substantial fraction of uncleaved prM is found on some dengue viruses, particularly that produced in insect cells, and such partially cleaved viruses can still be infectious. For WNV the N-linked site on prM can also mediate interaction with L-SIGN, and in common with glycan at position 154 this also showed differential specificity for L-SIGN when expressed in mammalian cell lines, perhaps mediated by the presence of N-acetylglucosamine\u2013terminated structures [29].",

C, DCs were incubated with a mixture of C6/36-produced and DC-produced virus at MOI = 1 and stained for infection with 2G6. D, Vero cells and DCs were incubated with C6/36-produced or DC-produced DENV, surface stained with anti-E mAb (4G2), and analyzed by flow cytometry.
