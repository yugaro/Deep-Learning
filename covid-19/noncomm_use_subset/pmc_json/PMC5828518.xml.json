Plasma therapy has been used experimentally for the last 100 years to treat severe infectious diseases beginning with diphtheria in the 1890\u2019s, Spanish flu of 1917\u20131918, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. A meta-analysis of 8 non-randomized studies using convalescent blood products during the 1918 influenza pandemic calculated a case-fatality rate of 16% among 336 treated participants compared to 37% among 1219 controls. [1] A cohort study of 93 participants with severe H1N1 influenza demonstrated lower mortality in the treatment group receiving H1N1 convalescent plasma vs the control group (20\u00b70% vs. 54\u00b78%; P = .01), [2] although mortality in the control group was higher than expected for comparable severity of illness. [3\u20136] Despite these encouraging data, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) of immune plasma for severe influenza has ever been conducted. In an effort to more rigorously evaluate the role of immune plasma in the treatment of severe influenza we conducted a RCT in a non-pandemic setting in participants with respiratory compromise due to influenza.",

The study initially was restricted to onset of illness within 7 days, but subsequently revised to allow participants to be enrolled regardless of onset time if there was active viral replication (as evidenced by a positive diagnostic test). The study initially enrolled participants with influenza H1N1 only, but was amended to also include influenza H3N2 and B. Participants were excluded if ABO compatible plasma was not available, if the participant had received investigational antivirals in the prior 2 weeks, if they had a history of any allergic reactions to blood products, if they had medical conditions in which they could not tolerate 500 mL volume, or if there was a clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness was primarily due to a condition other than active influenza virus replication (e.g. primarily a bacterial superinfection). Per protocol, only non-pregnant adults were enrolled in the first year. Subsequently, after Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of interim data, children and pregnant women were also made eligible for enrollment.",

At the beginning of the study, plasma was collected by donor directed programs (screening participants for high titer HAI, and then serially collecting plasma from these individuals). Through the course of the study, the plasma collection was changed to screening units of plasma from blood establishments to identify units with high HAI titers to influenza A or influenza B.

The secondary endpoints included: incidence and duration of clinical symptoms, incidence and duration of fever, time to resolution of all symptoms and fever, in-hospital, and 28-day mortality, duration of hospitalization, number of admissions and duration of admission to an intensive care unit, incidence and duration of supplemental oxygen, incidence of ARDS, incidence and duration of requiring mechanical ventilation, and disposition (home with no health care, home with health care, transferred to long-term care facility, hospitalization ongoing at Day 28, discharged to hospice care, deceased) following the last hospital discharge.

Additionally, several hundred units of plasma are screened each week to support this study, so the assay needed to be scalable for high throughput. For these reasons, units for this study were screened by HAI. However, the prior cohort study with anti-influenza convalescent plasma screened units by neutralizing antibody titer (NAT). [2] While NAT and HAI are generally related, there is not sufficient data to know which is the more appropriate method for screening plasma units. Additionally, it is possible that systemically administered antibodies do not sufficiently permeate mucosal surfaces in order to affect viral replication.",

The analysis of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of this intervention, however, presents several challenges. The administered plasma is not discernable from the intrinsic immune response. Unlike small molecules, the baseline titer does not begin at 0 due to both pre-existing immunity (prior infections and vaccinations) as well as any immune response occurring after the illness onset. By Day 28, the titer is higher in all participants regardless of treatment due to the adaptive immune response and remains elevated above baseline for months. Given the complexity of this type of analysis, the PK/PD is beyond the scope of this paper.",

There was also no difference between arms in the number of days during follow-up that oxygen supplementation was used despite the suggested improvement in resolution of tachypnea and hypoxia in plasma recipients. This may conceivably reflect the practice (intentional or by omission) of delayed discontinuation of supplemental oxygen despite the resolution of hypoxia.",

There was limited prior data by which an effect size could be determined for sample size calculations and, in the end, this study was underpowered. The unblinded design was another limitation of the study. Potential placebos (e.g. saline with albumin) were debated during protocol development, although even with elaborate blinding schemes the study team is unlikely to have been effectively blinded. Ultimately it was concluded that incorporation of a placebo should await a larger, more definitive trial. One unintended consequence of this decision was the observation that losses to follow up appeared to be somewhat higher in the participants that received standard care as compared to those that received plasma. After being consented but then informed that no specific study treatment would be provided, we suspect that participants that received standard care were less motivated to complete all study visits. This however, did not compromise our ability to ascertain the primary endpoint.",

Due to the association of age and pregnancy with outcomes in H1N1 influenza, these were chosen as the primary stratification categories for randomization. With the limited sample size, we were concerned that additional stratification could have led to incomplete filling of blocks (over-stratification), and subsequent imbalances. The differences in the severity of illness likely also accounts for the higher viral burden in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs at baseline in the standard care arm.",

Despite engagement of established investigators in infectious diseases, intensive care, and emergency medicine at 29 academic medical centers, enrollment and randomization of 98 participants took over 4 years. Major challenges included a low incidence of influenza illness in some years of the study and the lack of experience of most blood establishments with using plasma as an investigational product. Some participants, families, and even treating physicians also expressed reluctance in using a human blood product for a disease like influenza, where morbidity and mortality is often underappreciated. There were additional challenges unique to the investigational product including the moving target of antigenic drift in circulating influenza subtypes and the need to match this evolution over time with contemporaneous plasma, and the comparatively short shelf life of plasma units necessitating frequent replenishment of expiring units.",

Given the need for better therapies for influenza as well as the need to have strategies in place to rapidly launch effective therapeutic countermeasures for diseases of this type, it is of critical importance to accurately determine the efficacy of immune plasma. With these considerations, we believe that this approach should be further studied in a larger randomized trial. As noted, such a trial is presently underway.",
