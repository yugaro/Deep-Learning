In pediatric patients, adenovirus pneumonia can present with the features of bacterial pneumonia (1). Many cases of fatal adenovirus respiratory infection in immune-suppressed adults have been described in the literature. Because humoral and cellular immunity are generally important in overcoming viral infection, life-threatening adenovirus pneumonia in patients with defective or deficient T-cell immunity, such as those with bone marrow or solid organ transplant, malignant neoplasm, or AIDS, has been reported (2345). However, there have been a few cases of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. Historically, epidemics and outbreaks of adenovirus pneumonia in military recruits and health care facilities have been described (6789). These cases have raised concerns about adenovirus infection in the general population, but there is still limited information on the condition.",

Furthermore, if any clinico-radiological factors appeared to foreshadow the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), aggressive treatment and careful follow-up evaluation can be prepared in advance. Thus, the aim of our study was to identify the incidence, clinical features, survival outcome, and radiological findings of adenovirus pneumonia acquired in the community. We also compared clinico-radiological factors between patients with and without ARDS in order to determine possible predictors for patients who might develop respiratory failure.",

All patients underwent Gram stains, bacterial and fungal cultures of blood and urine. Sputum was stained and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Specimens from patients who underwent bronchoscopy with the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy, as well as those who underwent surgical biopsy, were stained and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for BAL specimens and nasal or throat swabs were performed to detect viral organisms. Patients in whom other infectious organisms were identified in the sputum, blood, urine, nasal and throat swabs, BAL fluid, or lung specimen within four weeks of adenovirus identification were regarded to have a concurrent infection and were excluded from this study. Finally, 19 patients confirmed to have only adenovirus pneumonia were included in this study; these patients included the five patients whose imaging features were published in our previous study (10).",

Serial chest radiographs were acquired for all patients during hospitalization in order to assess the progression of disease. CT studies were performed using various helical CT scanners (Hi Speed Advantage, Light Speed QXi, Light Speed Ultra, Light Speed VCT and Discovery CT750 HD, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, England; Brilliance 40, Philips, Best, the Netherlands; Aquilion, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). CT scans (114\u2013210 mA, 120 kVp, beam width of 10\u201320 mm, beam pitch of 1.375\u20131.5) were performed from the lung apices to the level of the middle portions of both kidneys. Intravenous contrast medium injection was used in approximately half of the patients (10 patients), with 1.5 mL/kg (body weight) of Iomeron 300 (iomeprol, 300 mg iodine/mL; Bracco, Milan, Italy) injected at an infusion rate of 3 mL/s using a power injector (MCT Plus; Medrad, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The imaging data were reconstructed with section thicknesses of 2.5\u20135 mm using a bone algorithm. The reconstructed images were then interfaced directly to a picture archiving and communication system (Centricity 3.0; GE Healthcare, Mt. Prospect, IL, USA), which displayed all image data on two monitors (1536 \u00d7 2048 matrix, 8-bit viewable gray scale, and 60-ft-lambert luminescence).

Parenchymal opacity was defined as an area that appears denser than the surrounding lung tissue without a discrete border. The pattern of the disease course was also identified from sequential chest radiographs as described by Wong et al. (16) and Das et al. (17), where type 1 was radiographic improvement, type 2 was radiographic deterioration by one peak level followed by improvement, type 3 was fluctuating radiographic changes with at least two peaks, and type 4 was progressive radiographic deterioration.

Consolidation was defined as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal opacity that obscured the margins of vessels and airway walls (18). The presence of interlobular septal thickening or pleural effusion was also recorded, and the laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral) of the lesions was evaluated. Septal thickening was defined as abnormal widening of an interlobular septum or septa (18). In terms of anatomic location, the distribution of parenchymal abnormalities was classified as central, peripheral, or mixed in the axial plane and upper, lower, or random in the longitudinal plane. The outer third of the lung was defined as peripheral, and the inner two-thirds of the lung were defined as central. The lesions were regarded as distributed in the upper lung zone when they were located above the hilum, in the lower lung zone when they were located below the hilum, or random when the distribution could not be determined. For the acquisition of CT scores, the lung was also divided into upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina and up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones. The involvement of pneumonia within each lung zone was evaluated by scoring each zone from 0 (normal) to 4, with 4 corresponding to nearly total involvement of the lung parenchyma. Total CT scores ranged from 0 to 24 when combined for all six zones (1719).",

Thus, the diagnosis might have been delayed, missing the important opportunity for timely treatment. In addition, our institution is a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul; thus, the rates of ARDS and mortality could be further exaggerated.

It is known that adenovirus causes cytolysis, which accounts for tissue damage, and damaged pulmonary capillaries can contribute to respiratory failure (24). Another possible explanation is the unregulated complement activation, producing C5a and resulting in activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, release of histones, and, eventually, a cytokine storm (2526). Many previous cases of respiratory failure resulting from influenza A viruses H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pneumonia were associated with cytokine storms (27). Similar to these highly pathogenic viruses which have been severe threats to public health, adenovirus might have triggered cytokine storms in patients who progressed to ARDS. However, it is still difficult to explain why some individuals are susceptible to systemic inflammation, whereas others are resistant to it. Further studies should be performed to identify the viral determinants and genetic factors associated with ARDS, and to better understand the pathophysiology of adenovirus infection.",

With regard to the initial chest radiographic findings, two patients (11%) were normal, while focal opacity was noted in nine patients (47%). Despite the well-known imaging features of viral pneumonia, which causes diffuse and bilateral interstitial involvement (28), two patients in our study presented with unilateral consolidation and GGO with or without pleural effusion. Features of focal opacity on chest radiograph and unilateral dense consolidation on CT were likely to be interpreted as community-acquired pneumonia. In fact, there have been several reports describing adenovirus pneumonias that have presented with unilateral lobar infiltrates (6820). Thus, we should not discard the possibility of adenoviral pneumonia in patients suspected of having an acute lower respiratory tract infection with unilateral airspace lesion, especially when response to antibiotics was ineffective, and sputum Gram stain and culture were negative for bacterial infection.

Further work needs to be performed investigating the virulent strains of adenovirus, particularly with regard to radiologic appearance, disease extent, and severity. Third, the time to CT acquisition from symptom onset was heterogeneous, ranging from two to 15 days. CT scans from the ARDS group might have progressed from an initially mild disease to showing a relatively large extent of involvement. Fourth, we simplified the chest radiographic abnormality as focal, multifocal, and diffuse opacity without assessing other findings such as interstitial opacities. However, we were more focused on the disease extent and sequential radiographic changes rather than detailed radiographic findings. Fifth, our study only included patients confirmed to have adenovirus pneumonia and did not include a comparison group. Sixth, the diagnosis of adenovirus pneumonia was made using various methods. Lastly, the number of cases in the present study is small, and a large-scale prospective study is needed. In addition, comparison of clinico-radiological features between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with adenovirus pneumonia would also have clinical implications toward understanding the clinical course of the disease.",
