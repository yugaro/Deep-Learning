It is aimed at cultivating professional physicians who are devoted to lifelong learning and self-improvement. According to criticism from the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation in 1998, Taiwan's medical schools began to initiate curricular reform to improve several deficiencies in medical education [2]. During the transformation of Taiwan into a developed country, citizens began to question the high social status of physicians, and educational philosophic thoughts from the USA started to influence the traditional curriculum design. Considering contemporary societal needs, the medical education program should be transformed. This review presents an exploration of the roots underlying the medical educational reform over the past 30 years and the prospects of future physicians in Taiwan [3].",

The implementation of the National Health Insurance Program and the hospital accreditation system has resulted in noticeable changes in the medical environment, especially a new level of citizen entitlement. Such changes have engendered negative effects; for example, hospital sizes are increasing and hi-tech treatments and performance management are prioritized. The conventional curriculum and teaching methods cannot keep pace with the rapid development of medical technology and changes in the medical environment. Furthermore, there has been a lack of professionalism in the curriculum of medical education. The Conference of Deans of Medical Schools passed a resolution of a new medical education program in 2000. A reform of medical education program task force team, also named as \u201cnew medical education program working group,\u201d was requested to establish and to supervise course effectiveness [4]. Prof. Huang pointed out the necessity of integrating liberal education into existing course [5]. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome spread across Taiwan. Educators aware the core values of the medical profession, compatible with the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). For the response of global standards from WFME, several medical schools strived to facilitate the integration of basic science and clinical disciplines, besides, emphasis on interpersonal communication [6]. Since 2005, medical specialists and the government have collaborated on restructuring the local medical education program; the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan launched the postgraduate year program (PGY program) on a trial basis before officially launching it in 2011 [7].",

Moreover, the time-based educational approach adopted in the previous program has been restructured. Specifically, an outcome-based educational approach that is based on those of other countries transformed the old medical education program into a 6-year program and established criteria for qualified physician status according to the required professional abilities for health care [12]. Core competencies comprising various combinations of knowledge, skills, and attitudes are increasingly recognized and defined. Furthermore, the various clinical standards of physicians with different core competencies are combined to establish milestones for clinical physicians, the practice results of which are ultimately demonstrated in the clinical outcomes [1314]. Numerous countries have developed unique competency-based medical education (CBME) systems [15]. Canadian scholars recommended the implementation of a responsible and flexible learner-centered educational method instead of the time-based educational approach. They identified 10 common factors that can be categorized into four main themes as follows: Organizing framework, rationale, contrast with time, and implementation; and six subthemes: Outcomes and milestones defined, the curriculum of competencies, demonstrable abilities, assessment of competencies, learner center, and societal needs [1316]. Accordingly, in medical education, eliminating the discipline-centered teaching method might accelerate the diversified integration of courses oriented toward clinical practice and basic medicine. The essence of core-CBME should be thoroughly explored before the introduction of localized CBME in Taiwan [17].",

The book \u201cEducating Physician\u201d reveals the three main aspects of physician development: Cultivating expertise and relevant abilities to care for patients; developing inquiry and innovative thinking; and participating in social networks and contributing to society [3]. In the 21st century, medical education involves the following objectives: Endeavoring to link theoretical knowledge and practical experience; creating opportunities for students' early engagement in patient care, thus enabling students to achieve in-depth learning when making reflections; and stimulating students' inquiries and critical thinking during problem-solving. Abraham Flexner emphasized the knowledge structure and liberal education; considered basic education on medical treatment as the foundation of medical education; highlighted the importance of communication skills, physical examination skills, and attitude in Hi-tech medical environments; and should be subjective to integration of evidence-based medicine and medical ethics to enable medical students to adapt to public perception toward future medical care [18]. On the basis of experiencing 23 years following the implementation of Taiwan's health insurance, the medical education program should promote community medicine and general medicine education, emphasize students' self-directed learning, and advocate the inquired and interactive teaching methods. Medical schools and educators devoted to invited faculty and curricular committee joined this evolution in medical education for decades. Organ-based and clinical cases were integrated to teaching plans to link all scientific praxis in human. There were generally three sections of the new program as follows: (1) premedical section, (2) integrated medical section, and (3) clinical medical section, at the same time, vertically combination with medical humanities and public health [Table 2]. In addition, educators aimed at enabling students to experience the diverse roles of a physician, such as advocating patient welfare, developing and incorporating innovations, and collaborating with inter-professional team members in the workplace [3]. Thus, innovative and student-centered instructional methods were massively adopted, such as problem-based learning [19].",

The cognitive theory of teaching proposed by Anderson comprises four knowledge levels, namely practical knowledge, theoretical knowledge, procedural knowledge, and metacognitive knowledge, the highest level; this theory is reshaping the structure of the curriculum of medical education [21].

Subsequently, the Joint Commission of Taiwan hosts the PGY training program for medical students, achieving a competency-based continuing education system for training prospective physicians on clinical care [24].",

However, the previous time-based educational approach requires 12 years for students to mature as an attending physician. The old program could not sustain the considerable global change in digitization and the globalization of finance and logistics. The WFME analyzed contemporary global medical trends and suggested that a medical professional in the 21st century should demonstrate nine standards for basic medical education, which are consistent with the aforementioned six core competencies of physicians. Those movement of standards should be student-activated instruction, prioritize patients with good communication, student influence on program development and cultivating medical leadership, emphasize the provision of high-quality medical care to patients through self-regulated learning, aboard and distant learning assist with technology and utilization of skills laboratory [6]. In the following discussion, we pointed out educational strategies to bridge the gap of educational reforms.",

Strategies and practices in education reform that are established on the basis of a realistic understanding fulfil the philosophy of \u201ceducation is life itself.\u201d The changes in Taiwan's 6-year medical education program are outlined as follows: Shortening the education period and thus enabling medical students to receive clinical training earlier; helping medical students to engage in the PGY as qualified physicians in clinical practice; and developing comprehensive core competencies for physicians. This \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d in the workplace is consistent with Dewey's perspective [26]. The essential elements of Dewey's perspective include evoking students' intrinsic curiosity, which might subsequently be transformed into active motivation for learning continuously; cultivating problem-solving and task-achievement abilities by using project-based learning; and transforming classrooms into laboratories and encouraging students to engage in lifelong learning. The key factor still underlines clinical teachers' guidance throughout the learning process, the transformation of medical knowledge into practical skills, and management of clinical tasks, all of which closely match the concept of CBME and outcome-based education. The bottom-up reform of the medical education program and the top-down reform of the education program led by medical educators would complement each other only when teachers are given autonomy in teaching activity.",

Thus, the 6-year medical education program creates a complete learning environment using an innovative curriculum design that combines a formal curriculum, an informal curriculum, and a hidden curriculum (i.e., making it new). Several examples of curriculum design are presented as follows. In Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan, a flipped teaching method is applied in the anesthesiology course; this enables students to learn at their own pace and thus improve their professional competencies and engage in self-directed learning by engaging in pre-class preparations and using the interactive online teaching platform Zuvio in the class [29]. Several institutions have also applied a hidden curriculum. For example, Tzu Chi University in Taiwan has implemented a silent mentor program aimed at cultivating the spirit of service in students [28]. National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan has implemented an on-doctoring program that emphasizes the cultivation of human-centered thinking and lifelong learning in students [30]. Furthermore, the Miharashi medical service team in Tzu Chi University has, since 2006, taught students about serving others by arranging visits to indigenous tribes [31]. Such visits enable students to perceive health needs from residents of remote areas in eastern Taiwan and consequently inspire students to respect life and engage in self-reflection. Harden proposed SPICE model to design curriculum during implement of educational reform strategies [32]. Educators thus use problem-based methods to evaluate a community's needs and provide learner-centered courses for creating a comprehensive and systematic learning environment. However, numerous teachers and parents have raised concerns about the practical processes of an informal curriculum and a hidden curriculum in Taiwan.",

The literature review revealed that the effectiveness of flipped teaching depends on learners' compliance and the established learning space [3334]. Thus, several issues with the implementation of the teaching strategies in the new medical education program involve recruiting and retaining the right teachers and defining the required teaching abilities of clinical teachers in medical schools [23]. Harris advocated that medical teachers can refine themselves by not only advancing in the medical profession but also enhancing their teaching skills and general competencies in the contemporary medical system. These problems might also occur in the new education program. An example of such problems is as follows: Determining how existing clinical teachers under the old system can understand the basic competencies defined in the 6-year medical education and how they can adapt instruction methods to attain learners' competencies and allocate educational resource according to various teaching objectives effectively. A disruptive education environment might impose a burden on clinical physicians and result in patient dissatisfaction.",

Prof. Huang analyzed problems in the quota of full-time teachers in medical schools in Taiwan and suggested that the full potential of such teachers' passion and skills for teaching was not raised [5]. In addition, universities and schools face difficulties in supervising clinical teachers, and this leads to reduced teaching quality. A necessary reform depends upon bringing together around common goals all of the key players in the organization, regulation and conduct of medical education, taking an example as Emory School of Medicine in the US [35]. Regarding the recruitment of teachers in medical schools, we suggest the following changes: Stakeholders establishing recruitment standards that are based on teaching performance instead of research publications, which were emphasized in previous educational program; adoption of teaching experience and faculty's competencies as the basis for determining the number of courses the teacher should undertake; implementation of teacher evaluation to prevent senior faculty from passing on most of their courses to junior members in order to ease their own burden; supervisors inspecting in-service teachers' performance in lifelong learning and passion for teaching, moreover, developing innovative teaching activities; the educational institutes providing supplementary and enabling training courses for unqualified teachers to receive credit for faculty development and fulfil teaching obligation in medical education.",

Physicians' abilities are actually judged by patients in the clinical setting. When patients encounter novice graduates, who are considered to be adequately capable by medical schools, they cannot distinguish physicians from the new and the old program. Therefore, clinical personnel may shoulder any response and conflicts in the clinic during the transition of two educational programs. The burden imposed on physicians who also serve as clinical teachers is heavier than ever. To bridge the gap between the new and old medical education programs, clinical faculty must adhere to the essential goals of education, share clinical, and teaching responsibilities with each other.
