Liver cirrhosis is one of the major diseases leading to mortality in Korea in which the incidence rate of hepatitis B is high.[4] There are a variety of causes, including chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, consumption of a large amount of alcohol, and autoimmunity, while hepatitis B is the most common, with 48% to 70% of cases.[5]",

Most common complications are ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and varicose veins.[8] Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancing the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients.[7] With the recent diversification of chronic diseases, the incidence rate of complications has also risen; so, the management of complications has a higher influence over the quality of life.[7\u20139] Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that in patients with liver cirrhosis, the presence of complications and its treatment are critical factors for anticipating the degradation of the quality of life and the mortality.",

            "text": "Liver transplantation enhances the quality of life and survival rate of patients with cirrhosis; however, numerous patients are not given the opportunity of liver transplantation due to a lack of donors. As an indicator for the progress and prognosis of cirrhosis, the model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) has been recommended.[10,11] Traditionally, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) is used as index for assessing the progress of cirrhosis of an inpatient, and the severity of cirrhosis is classified into A, B, and C based on the presence of ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy, serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, and serum albumin.[10,12] Using CTP, 5 to 6 points are assigned to Stage A, 7 to 9 points to Stage B, and 10 points or higher to Stage C. The higher the score is, the more severe it gets.[10] However, since subjective judgement could be involved in the judgement of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, indices of CTP, the judgement of severity using the MELD or the MELD-Na is becoming more important, as well as treatment mediation based on such severity.[11] MELD-Na is assessed with serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and other factors. Since MELD-Na is more likely to predict mortality than other tools, it has been recently used to create a waiting list of patients for liver transplantation.[12,13] Studies on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis have been mostly focused on terminal cases and anticipation of short-term mortality, and most of them highlight the analysis of prognosis of patients with cirrhosis rather than classification of patients considering the level of severity.[14\u201319] Moreover, the analysis of prognostic factors for mortality of patients should include not only disease-related factors, but also personal and social factors. Such analysis could provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications. Therefore, in this study, patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group using MELD-Na designed with objective physiological indicators, and prognostic factors were analyzed for each group. We aimed to devise a self-nursing method suitable for each severity level of liver cirrhosis and to provide basic data for improving the effectiveness of management of chronic diseases.",

Although a difference between hepatitis B and hepatitis C could be attributable,[28] it also supported that a rapid treatment of viral hepatitis might affect prognosis. That is why, the early administration of antiviral drugs is important for reducing the incidence of cirrhosis and disease-related mortality.[29] Due to the recent diversification of hepatitis antiviral drugs, it would be the top priority to provide proper instructions on how to administer them. Patients should be educated to have an accurate understanding about drugs, as well as the importance of administration of antiviral drugs for treatment.

Laboratory results are not significant as a mortality predictor in the high-risk group because they are included in the classification criterion or they include abnormal results since patients are at high risk for mortality. On the other hand, in case of the low-risk group, laboratory results are likely to indicate normal conditions so the change in such laboratory results could have a significant influence over the mortality risk rate. Therefore, for patients with early stage cirrhosis, laboratory results are very important and it is also important for them to understand that it is critical to monitor and correct the laboratory results for the treatment of disease.",

The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for disease management. Furthermore, this classification could be the foundation for patients with cirrhosis, for which early detection of mortality prognosis and timely management of complications are critical to correct such prognostic factors and apply a proper nursing intervention. This study is significant given that it applied MELD-Na to patients diagnosed with cirrhosis complications for the first time, examined its cut-off point to classify patients based on the risk of disease, and investigated the risk factors for each risk group. Furthermore, it examined prognostic factors from a population-social perspective, other than the medical perspective.",

Since this study analyzed mortality prognostic factors through the analysis of survival of patients with cirrhosis, it would be possible to have a variety of studies on factors of survival and mortality of patients from the perspective of nursing through the analysis of survival of various diseases. Especially, based on the results of this study, when nursing patients are diagnosed with complications of cirrhosis for the first time, early detection of mortality prognostic factors would be possible. Such early detection could allow for the correction of factors that might promote mortality, as well as prevention of recurrence of the complications and provision of nursing interventions to help the progress of disease in patients.",
