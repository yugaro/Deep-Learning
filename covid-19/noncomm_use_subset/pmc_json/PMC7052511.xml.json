Features of the Zika virus disease and its control complicated the outbreak response; these included multiple modes of viral transmission (mosquito bite, sexual contact, mother-to-fetus); absence of an effective vaccine; prevention via individual behavior modifications and environmental interventions; and uncertain health impacts for affected infants (Oussayef et al., 2017). As a result, public health professionals faced many ethics concerns: Was comprehensive reproductive healthcare available for women (The Lancet Global Health, 2016, Pan American Health Organization, 2016, Saenz, 2016)? What outbreak controls were appropriate when most contagious individuals were asymptomatic (Jamrozik et al., 2018)? Which prevention and treatment studies were morally defensible (Marston et al., 2016, Shah et al., 2017)?",

Interventions seen as out-of-sync with local values could foster community resistance. Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes, for instance, could trigger public worry about unnatural interventions that alter the environment in harmful ways. Accessing private property to identify mosquito habitats, too, could upset residents who cherish their independence, chafe at government interference, and value their property rights. By explaining control alternatives, eliciting community input on acceptable interventions, and sharing the rationale for specific choices, public health professionals have a greater chance of earning the public\u2019s confidence and cooperation (Jamrozik and Selgelid, 2018, Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2016, Tambo et al., 2017). Moreover, involving local residents in a coordinated campaign to reduce mosquito habitats at the community level \u2013 such as enlisting whole neighborhoods to empty/cover containers with standing water \u2013 can raise the likelihood of successful vector control (Jamrozik and Selgelid, 2018, World Health Organization, 2017). Control of other mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya), has increasingly enlisted community members in decentralized campaigns (Alvarado-Castro et al., 2017, Andersson et al., 2015, Elsinga et al., 2017, Lucena et al., 2018).",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and pandemic flu each prompted assessment of outbreak ethics (Kim, 2016, Maduka and Odia, 2015, Singer et al., 2003). Against this backdrop, our study examined assumptions that local opinion leaders in 4 US localities at high risk of Zika transmission held about community involvement in public health policymaking for outbreak response. They discussed factors shaping community willingness, including their own, to consent to aerial spraying, a controversial outbreak control measure (Biehler et al., 2018, Maxwell, 2003, Tedesco et al., 2010, Thier, 2001).",

Despite its limits, the study establishes an important foundation for future inquiries. The thematic analysis may serve as the first phase of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design that would build to quantitative data collection and analysis (Creswell, 2014). For instance, quantitative explorations of the same topics could better ascertain the frequency of attitudes, opinions, and perceptions and allow researchers to generalize more broadly (Liamputtong, 2011, Sullivan and Sargeant, 2011).",
