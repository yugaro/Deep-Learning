            "text": "We focused on HBV entry and established a cell culture system to evaluate this step in HBV infection. To identify small molecules inhibiting HBV entry, we pretreated HepaRG cells27 with compounds for 2 hours, then added a HBV inoculum and continued incubation with compounds for 16 hours (Fig. 1A). After washing out free HBV and compounds, the cells were cultured for an additional 12 days in the absence of compounds (Fig. 1A). For robust chemical screening, HBV infection was monitored by the viral envelope protein (HBs) level secreted from the infected cells at 12 days postinfection by ELISA. This assay could identify heparin, an HBV attachment inhibitor,28,29 and bafilomycin A1, a v-type H+ ATPase inhibitor that blocks acidification of vesicles and HBV entry,30 but not lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor,31 as compounds reducing HBs protein level in the medium (Fig. 1B). In addition, use of an anti-HBs antibody to neutralize viral entry, but not use of an anti-FLAG antibody, reduced viral protein secreted from the HBV-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, this system is likely to evaluate the effect of compounds on the early phase of the HBV life cycle, including attachment and entry, but not effects on HBV replication. A chemical screen with this system revealed that CsA reduced HBs secretion from HBV-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment with CsA significantly decreased HBc protein expression (Fig. 1C) and HBV DNA as well as cccDNA (Fig. 1D) in the cells and HBe in the medium (Fig. 1E), without causing cytotoxicity (Supporting Fig. S1A). This effect of CsA was not limited to infection of HepaRG cells, as we observed a similar anti-HBV effect of CsA for PHHs (Fig. 1F). The anti-HBV effect of CsA was also observed on HBV infection of PHHs in the absence of PEG8000 (Fig. S1B), indicating that the effect of CsA did not depend on PEG8000, which was normally included in the HBV infection experiments. These data suggest that CsA blocked HBV infection.",

The HBV life cycle can be divided into two phases: the early phase of infection including attachment, entry, nuclear import, and cccDNA formation, and the following late phase representing HBV replication that includes transcription, assembly, reverse transcription, and viral release.32 Lamivudine drastically decreased HBV DNAs in HepAD38 cells,33 which reproduce HBV replication but not the early phase of infection (Fig. 2B). In addition, continuous treatment with lamivudine as well as entecavir and interferon-\u03b1 for 4 days after HBV infection could decrease HBV DNA levels in HBV-infected HepaRG cells, which suggests an inhibition of HBV replication (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, lamivudine did not show an anti-HBV effect when applied only prior to and during HBV infection (Fig. 1A,B), suggesting that the anti-HBV compounds identified in Fig. 1A interrupted the early phase of the HBV life cycle.",

For evaluating HBV attachment,34 cell surface HBV DNA was extracted and quantified from HepaRG cells exposed to HBV at 4\u00b0C for 3 hours and then washed (Fig. 2D-a). For the internalization assay,34 the above cells, after washing, were further cultured at 37\u00b0C for 16 hours to allow HBV to internalize into the cells, and then trypsinized to digest HBV remaining on the cell surface to allow quantification of internalized HBV DNA (Fig. 2D-b). CsA slightly reduced the amount of attached HBV DNA, although the effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 2D-a). In contrast, CsA caused a significant reduction of HBV DNA in the internalization assay (Fig. 2D-b). In the time of addition assay as shown in Fig. 2E, treatment with CsA during HBV infection decreased HBs and HBe production (Fig. 2E-b), while CsA did not have an anti-HBV effect when delivered after HBV infection (Fig. 2E-c). Thus, CsA appears to primarily block the entry step including internalization. To examine whether CsA targeted HBV particles or host cells, we preincubated HBV with CsA and then purified the CsA from the HBV inoculum, followed by measurement of the HBV infectivity using HepaRG cells (Fig. 2F). Preincubation with CsA did not affect HBV infectivity, in contrast to the antagonizing effect of heparin to HBV particles (Fig. 2F), suggesting that CsA did not affect HBV particles but rather targeted host cells.",

In contrast, CyPA and CyPB were expressed in all of these cell lines, irrespective of infection susceptibility. Intriguingly, we found that the inhibition of NTCP transporter activity correlated with anti-HBV entry activity (Figs. 5A, 4A,B). These results suggest the possibility that compounds targeting NTCP have the potential to block HBV infection. To test this prediction, we treated HepaRG cells with compounds known to inhibit NTCP, including ursodeoxycholate, cholic acid, propranolol, progesterone, and bosentan35,36 to investigate the effect on HBV entry using the protocol in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 5D, these compounds inhibited HBV infection. Thus, inhibition of NTCP blocked HBV infection. We also showed that HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP were susceptible to HBV infection (Fig. 5E), as reported recently.22 Treatment with CsA also reduced HBs and HBe secretion when these cells were infected with HBV (Fig. 5E), suggesting that CsA inhibited NTCP-mediated HBV infection.",

To test this possibility, we established an AlphaScreen assay to evaluate LHBs-NTCP binding in vitro as described in the Materials and Methods. In vitro synthesized NTCP and LHBs were at least partially functional, as NTCP bound to its substrate TCA (Fig. S3A) and LHBs could neutralize HBV infection into HepaRG cells (Fig. S3B). As shown in Fig. 5F, incubation of recombinant NTCP with LHBs but not middle (MHBs) and small envelope protein (SHBs) produced a significant AlphaScreen signal (Fig. 5F-a, left) indicative of a direct protein-protein interaction. In contrast to NTCP, recombinant GST or other nonrelevant proteins, LCK and FYN,37 did not produce a binding signal when incubated with LHBs (Fig. 5F-a), suggesting that our AlphaScreen assay produced a specific signal for the interaction of NTCP with LHBs. Consistent with the report that the pre-S1 region of LHBs was important for the binding to NTCP,22 the signal was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of pre-S1 lipopeptide HBVpreS/2-48myr,5 (Fig. 5F-b) but not of an inactive mutant of pre-S1 (Fig. S3C), indicating a competition of pre-S1 with LHBs for NTCP binding. In this assay, CsA as well as FK506 and a CsA derivative, SCYX1454139 (see the next section), were shown to reduce the signal for LHBs-NTCP binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5F-c,d,e). These results suggest that CsA targets NTCP and thereby inhibits the interaction between LHBs and NTCP.",

As shown in Fig. 6A, SCYX618806 reduced HBs secretion after HBV infection, while a related analog SCYX1774198 did not have a significant anti-HBV effect (Fig. 6A,C). Additional analogs, SCYX827830 and SCYX1454139, had significant anti-HBV activities (Fig. 6A,C). Alisporivir (Debio 025), an anti-HCV drug candidate,38 also decreased HBV infection to the equivalent level to CsA (Fig. 6B). Figure 6D shows a dose-dependent reduction of HBs secretion by treatment with SCYX618806, SCYX827830, and SCYX1454139, all of which had more potent anti-HBV activities than CsA (compare Fig. 6D with Fig. 2A). These results indicate that anti-HBV activity is not disrupted by at least some changes to the 3-glycine, 4-leucine, and 8-alanine residues of CsA, although additional analogs will need to be evaluated for a full understanding of the structure-activity relationships. Notably, SCYX618806 and alisporivir bear modifications on the 4-leucine residue of the CsA backbone that prevent CN binding and immunosuppressive activity (Table S1), further confirming that anti-HBV activity does not require immunosuppressive activity. Notably, SCYX1454139 showed the strongest anti-HBV entry activity among 50 CsA derivatives examined (data not shown and Fig. 6E). The median inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) for anti-HBV activity as well as CC50s determined by an MTT-based cell viability assay are shown in Fig. 6E. The IC50 and CC50 of SCYX1454139 were 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 and >10 \u03bcM, respectively, a profile superior to that of CsA (IC50 and CC50 of 1.17 \u00b1 0.22 and >10 \u03bcM, respectively). Inhibition of HBV infection by treatment with SCYX1454139 was also observed in PHHs, in which also the anti-HBV effect of SCYX1454139 was more remarkable than that of CsA (Fig. 6F). These results clearly indicate that analogs of CsA may include compounds with greater anti-HBV potency than that of CsA itself.",

In this study, we showed that CsA inhibited the entry of HBV but in an apparent CyP-independent manner. It was previously reported that CsA suppressed HBV replication in a cell culture system carrying an HBV transgene.47 However, this antireplication effect is not likely to be responsible for the anti-HBV activity observed in this study, based on several observations. First, the experimental system mainly used in this study (Fig. 1A) is likely to evaluate the early phase of HBV infection but not HBV replication. Second, the suppression of HBV replication by CsA reported previously was mediated by blocking the mitochondrial permeability transition pore possibly through binding to mitochondrial CyPD.47,48 The anti-HBV activity shown in this study, however, had no correlation with binding to CyPs, suggesting that the inhibition of HBV infection in HepaRG cells and PHHs is not from the result of suppression of HBV replication. Rather, CsA inhibited NTCP transporter activity and disrupted the binding between NTCP and LHBs in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of HBV infection could be observed by treatment with other compounds having the capacity to inhibit NTCP. These results suggest that targeting NTCP blocks HBV infection.",

Development of anti-HBV agents targeting different molecules is greatly needed for achieving improved treatment of HBV infection, especially to combat drug-resistant virus. HBV cell entry mechanisms have been poorly defined. At the initial stage, HBV attaches to target cells with low affinity through binding involving cellular factors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans.28,29 For the subsequent entry mechanism, it has recently been reported that NTCP is essential for HBV-specific entry.22 Although the precise mechanism for entry and internalization is as yet incompletely understood, interference with this step has emerged as an attractive approach for development of novel therapeutics. For example, Gripon et al.5 demonstrated that a peptide mimicking the pre-S1 region of large envelope protein prevented HBV infection in a mouse model. These results suggest that inhibition of virus cell entry could be an effective strategy for preventing HBV infection to achieve clinical outcomes such as for postexposure prophylaxis, blockage of vertical transmission, and prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation. Given that HBV reactivation generally occurs under immunosuppressive conditions,49,50 it is uncertain whether clinically relevant doses of CsA or FK506 could be helpful in preventing HBV reactivation after liver transplantation. It remains also unknown in general whether entry inhibitors could be effective in eliminating chronic HBV infection. Future studies should evaluate whether inhibition of HBV entry by CsA or its derivatives can reduce persistent HBV infection, especially in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs or interferons. In this study, we obtained nonimmunosuppressive CsA derivatives that could inhibit HBV entry (Fig. 6). Moreover, a small-scale analog analysis identified a CsA derivative exhibiting more potent inhibition of HBV infection, with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 \u03bcM (Fig. 6). This IC50 is equivalent to the anti-HCV replication activities of alisporivir or SCY-635 (0.22 \u03bcM and 0.08 \u03bcM, respectively), drugs which have been shown to reduce HCV viral load in infected patients during clinical trials.38 Further analog analysis using CsA as a platform may identify more potent anti-HBV compounds.",

Cellular targets relevant for anti-HBV drug development have been poorly defined to date. This study has demonstrated that small molecules targeting NTCP can inhibit HBV infection. Further study of NTCP inhibitors and CsA derivatives may provide a new anti-HBV strategy targeting a cellular factor, which is less likely to foster emergence of drug-resistant viruses.",
