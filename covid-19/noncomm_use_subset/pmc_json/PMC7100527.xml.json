Thus, we hypothesized that the administration of these TLR7 or TLR9 ligands and subsequent treatment with methylprednisolone (MPSL) leads to ONFH in rats, and that these transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH via the TLRs. In the present study, to verify this hypothesis, we investigated (1) the incidence of ONFH in rats after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands in combination with MPSL and (2) whether NF-\u03baB and IRF7 contributed to the pathogenesis of ONFH after MPSL treatment.",

            "text": "Fukushima et al25 conducted a nationwide epidemiologic survey in Japan and reported a high frequency of SLE, nephrotic syndrome, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, bronchial asthma, and thrombocytopenic purpura, as the underlying disease in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. Recently, it was reported that innate immune signaling via TLR7 and TLR9 contributed to the pathogenesis of SLE,9 TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 signaling contributed to the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome,10 TLR3, and TLR7 signaling contributed to the pathogenesis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis,11 TLR4 signaling contributed to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma,12 and TLR4 and TLR7 signaling contributed to the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenic purpura.13 These reports showed that innate immune signaling via TLRs contributes to the pathogenesis of underlying diseases in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. We previously reported that corticosteroid treatment after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR 4 ligand, injection induces ONFH in Wistar rats, and suggested that the TLR4 signaling pathway may have a role in the pathogenesis of ONFH in rats.3, 4, 5 In the present study, we showed that the administration of TLR7 and TLR9 ligands in combination with MPSL treatment resulted in the development of ONFH in rats. In contrast, it was reported that mega-dose corticosteroid therapy, recommended under the national acute spinal cord injury protocol for spinal cord injury, resulting from trauma did not induce ONFH.2 In the present study, ONFH was not observed in the Saline+MPSL group, in which the rats did not receive the TLR ligands, indicating that corticosteroids alone failed to induce ONFH in healthy animals. There are several reports on osteonecrosis animal models using corticosteroid administration alone. Corticosteroid administration alone led to the development of ONFH in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).26 However, this treatment in the SHRs model is different from corticosteroid administration in healthy animals because of a genetic abnormality in the background of the SHRs.27 Further, it was reported that corticosteroids alone led to the development of ONFH in Leghorn chickens.28 Histopathological examination of specimens in this model showed that the subchondral bone trabeculae in the femoral head had disappeared.28 The diminution of the bone trabeculae was similar in appearance to micro-CT images of an osteoporosis animal model,29 but it was not clear whether it resulted from osteonecrosis. In addition, Yamamoto et al30 reported an osteonecrosis rabbit model in 1997. A characteristic of the rabbit model was that osteonecrosis developed in the metaphysis but not in the femoral head after the treatment of healthy rabbits with corticosteroids. On the other hand, Yamamoto et al30 also reported that corticosteroid treatment after LPS administration led to the development of osteonecrosis in the femoral head and the metaphysis in rabbits in 1995.22 These reports indicate that the administration of TLR ligands has a crucial role in the development of femoral head osteonecrosis. Therefore, present findings suggest that the administration of TLR ligands in combination with subsequent corticosteroid treatment are required to trigger the onset of primary corticosteroid-induced ONFH in rats, and that the pathogenesis of underlying diseases treated with corticosteroids contributes to the development of corticosteroid-induced ONFH. High-dose corticosteroid treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection was reported to be a risk factor of ONFH.31 SARS virus is a single-stranded RNA virus, which is one of the ligands of TLR7.32 Consequently, we believe that the pathogenesis of ONFH in Imiquimod+MPSL group resembles the pathogenesis of ONFH after corticosteroid treatment for SARS infection. Although ONFH was not found in the Saline+MPSL group rats, the fact that the Imiquimod+Saline rats, to which no alcohol or corticosteroids were given, developed ONFH at a lower rate indicates that this group resembled idiopathic ONFH. This result suggests that TLR7 signaling contributes to the development of idiopathic ONFH, and indicates that infection by a single-stranded RNA virus, which was one of the ligands for TLR7, could be a risk factor for idiopathic ONFH. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus, a single-stranded RNA virus, has already been reported as an isolated risk factor for idiopathic ONFH.33 Therefore, our results may explain the pathogenesis of idiopathic ONFH in patients infected with single-stranded RNA viruses.",

            "text": "It is well known that corticosteroids are mainly metabolized in the liver by a hepatic corticosteroid-metabolizing enzyme.36, 37 Recently, we reported that differences in liver function were observed between patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH and those without ONFH within 1 week after corticosteroid therapy.38 Moreover, Ichiseki et al39 reported that a disturbance in oxidative stress in the liver was observed within 24 h in an oxidative stress-induced ONFH rat model. These reports suggest that various changes in the liver in the early phase after treatment contribute to the development of ONFH. In the present study, we found that ONFH occurs within 3 days after MPSL treatment in rats, suggesting that detection of the early phase disease after MPSL treatment is important in clarifying the pathogenesis of ONFH. We also found that the activity of NF-\u03baB in the liver at 1 day was significantly repressed by corticosteroid treatment after TLR7 ligand administration. Auphan et al\n17 reported that glucocorticoids are the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Repression of NF-\u03baB activity via glucocorticoid receptors is one critical component of the inhibitory effect that glucocorticoids have on proinflammatory and immune responses.18 Therefore, our results suggest that ONFH results from the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF7 via the MyD88-dependent pathway, followed by a subsequent repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment, whereas IRF7 activity is not affected by corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, this result indicates that a repression in IRF7 activity using a specific inhibitor interferes with the development of ONFH in spite of the simultaneous repression in NF-\u03baB activity resulting from MPSL treatment. BAY11-7082 was reported to be an Ikk \u03b1 inhibitor and Ikk \u03b2 inhibitor with potential to inhibit NF-\u03baB and IRF7 activity.21 In the present study, MPSL treatment significantly repressed the activity of NF-\u03baB in Imiquimod+MPSL compared with Imiquimod+Saline rats (Figure 3), and accordingly, the co-administration of BAY11-7082 and MPSL did not repress the activity of NF-\u03baB in Imiquimod+BAY11+MPSL compared with Imiquimod+MPSL rats (Figure 4). In contrast, MPSL treatment did not alter the activity of IRF7 in Imiquimod+MPSL compared with Imiquimod+Saline rats (Figure 3), whereas the co-administration of BAY11-7082 and MPSL significantly repressed the activity of IRF7 in Imiquimod+BAY11+MPSL compared with Imiquimod+MPSL rats (Figure 4). And co-administration of BAY11-7082 and MPSL significantly lowered the incidence of ONFH through a repression in IRF7 activity. These findings confirmed that the effect of corticosteroid treatment on the transcription factor activity in the liver triggered the development of ONFH, and the repression in NF-\u03baB activity by corticosteroid treatment boosted the development of ONFH.",

Differences in IRF7 and NF-\u03baB activity in the liver induced by corticosteroid treatment triggered the development of ONFH, although it remains unclear how these signal transductions in the liver lead to femoral head osteonecrosis. The present study suggests that the pathogenesis/condition of underlying diseases treated with corticosteroid contributes to the development of ONFH. This might help to explain why ONFH develops or does not develop after corticosteroid therapy of the same dosage. We expect that the normalization of inflammatory status with new biologics for inflammatory diseases can prevent ONFH in the near future.",
