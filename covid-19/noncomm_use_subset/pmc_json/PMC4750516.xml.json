Bioethics was introduced to Korea in the 1990s, mostly in the form of clinical ethics and research ethics programs in medical schools and hospitals. From the beginning, the principalism proposed in Beauchamp and Childress\u2019s Principles of Biomedical Ethics [6] played a dominant role in biomedical ethics education in Korea. With the four principles of respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice, this liberal individualistic ethical frame was established for patient-health professional relationships based on the premise that patients are pure autonomous agents. Korea legally codified considerations regarding research ethics within a very short period of time. Enacted in 2005 to regulate genetic and embryo research, the Bioethics and Safety Act of Korea was revised in 2013 to mandate informed consent and ethics review for research on human subjects, including public health research. Enforcement of the Bioethics and Safety Act has promoted the awareness of individual rights and interests in research. Although Korea is a family-oriented, collectively-minded society holding strong communitarian values, the individualist libertarian approach imported from Western societies has been dominant in the field of biomedical ethics.",

With cost-benefit analysis and the concept of the quality-adjusted life year, public health policies and practice aim at maximizing human welfare or well-being given a certain investment of resources.

First is the harm principle, according to which it must be the case that clear and measurable harm to others will occur if exposure is not checked through quarantine or isolation. The second is the principle of proportionality, or of the least restrictive means. The least restrictive measures must be used to accomplish the goal of disease control. Voluntary quarantine should be implemented before turning to more restrictive means and sanctions. The third principle is that of reciprocity. If individuals sacrifice their liberties for the common good of the society, the society has reciprocal obligations to provide those individuals with needs such as food, shelter, and psychological support, and to protect them from discrimination, damages, or penalties as a result of quarantine. The final principle is the transparency principle, which states that the public health authorities must communicate transparently and clearly the justification for their actions and provide a process of appeal. This procedural due process is the ethical justification for the use of quarantine.",

For ethical decision making, the substantive values at stake are liberty, protection of the public from harm, proportionality, privacy, and reciprocity. Five procedural values also must be implemented, according to which public health measures should be reasonable, open and transparent, inclusive, responsive, and accountable. Based on these ethical values, these guidelines provide four concrete recommendations for governments and the health care sector: 1) the preparation of comprehensive and transparent protocols for the implementation of restrictive measures founded upon the above ethical principles; 2) ensuring public awareness of the rationale, benefits, and consequences of restrictive measures; 3) the implementation of measures to protect against stigmatization and to safeguard the privacy of those involved; 4) statements of the provisions and support services for those affected by restrictive measures and public discussions of the levels of compensation in advance.",

            "text": "Recently, critics of individualistic approaches to public health ethics have proposed alternative perspectives on the ethics of infectious diseases. One such framework draws on a relational approach to public health ethics [10]. It claims that public health ethics in the context of epidemic planning should differ from individualistic bioethics by placing the primary focus on the common good of the public. Rather than simply identifying the tensions between individual interests and community safety, responses to outbreaks should draw on the various ways in which individuals\u2019 interests are inseparable from and interrelated with the interests of the community. Claiming that personhood and autonomy are products of social relations, this approach focuses on relational personhood and relational autonomy, with the goal of working towards social justice and relational solidarity in public health [10]. Another important approach to the ethics of infectious diseases is an ethical framework that considers the infectious disease patient as both victim and vector (PVV) [11]. The PVV perspective sees individuals as socially located, biologically vulnerable, and interconnected with other human beings. If infection becomes a central concern, as in an epidemic or an outbreak, individual interests are not distinct from the interests of society as a whole. With all human individuals seen as potential PVVs embedded in the web of infectious disease transmission, the PVV view upholds sharing burdens fairly, trust, community participation, and responsibility. The view also helps avoid stigmatization and scapegoating, and provides for the humane care of infected patients including end-of-life care [11].",

A salient example is the government compensation policy for those who were ordered to stay home to prevent transmission of the disease, and compensation for the funeral costs to the surviving families of the deceased. Although the government was not able to have a public discussion of the appropriate levels of compensation in advance, the decisions about compensation and the procurement of financial resources for compensation were made in the middle of the outbreak, and were motivated by the discovery that those who were quarantined were faced with loss of income and employment, putting their livelihood at stake. Food and basic necessities were provided during the period of quarantine, and financial compensation for the loss of income was subsequently made according to the size of the family. In July 2015, the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act in Korea was revised to include clauses for the compensation of financial losses to those who were placed under quarantine, the hospitals that provided medical care for MERS-CoV patients, and the surviving family members of those who died from MERS-CoV. This compensation policy, formally recommended by the Special Committee of the Korea National Assembly for the MERS-CoV Outbreak in July 2015 in the midst of the outbreak, reflected the reciprocity principle. If individuals sacrifice their liberties for the common good of society, society has reciprocal obligations to provide the individuals with needs such as food, shelter, and psychological support.",

Without transparency and clear communication, public trust cannot be won and voluntary public collaboration cannot be expected. Furthermore, fear and stigmatization of quarantined residents and even of the families of health care workers occurred frequently, and this was exacerbated by the public distrust about transparency. Members of the public tended to seek their own safety at the cost of discriminating against certain groups within the community, in the absence of other information or guidance that they perceived to be trustworthy.",
