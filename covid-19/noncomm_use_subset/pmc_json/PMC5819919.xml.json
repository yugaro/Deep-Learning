Almost 50 years ago, Paediatric Virology was not considered an isolated discipline and was included in the Paediatric Infectious Diseases section of the scientific field of Paediatrics (2,3). However, during the past two decades, new advances in the field of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine have expanded the level of knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections occurring in infancy and childhood (4,5). These developments and changes highlight the demand for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Paediatric Virology, which combines Paediatrics with Virology, Epidemiology, Molecular Medicine, Evidence-based Medicine, Clinical Governance, Quality Improvement, and Pharmacology and Immunology (5).",

Along with the significant role of human breast milk and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, these issues included the necessity of the vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, prevention of hepatitis in newborns, recent advances on influenza vaccines, male vaccination against HPVs and the the preventative role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in children.",

Several of these infections are viral, e.g., herpes-group viruses, polyomaviruses and Torque teno viruses, and these result in long-time persistence and latency within human specific cell types (6). The fate of the latent genomes seems to vary substantially. They may remain dormant for the whole lifetime without any recognisable side effect. During prolonged latency, their genomes may become defective and can eventually be degraded. In particular, herpes-group viruses may become re-activated, leading locally to viral production and cell lysis. The interaction of the latent genomes with mutagenic chemical, physical or other biological factors may dysregulate the control of latency or persistence and may thus result in local exacerbations, mainly as the result of immunoreactivity (6).",

            "text": "Prolonged human breast feeding (>6 months) has been documented to have a beneficial effect on the avoidance of viral infections, e.g., norovirus- and rotavirus-related infections, which can potentially be lethal for newborn babies (7). It has also been shown that it reduces the risk of developing certain malignant tumours arising in early childhood, e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or in young adolescence, e.g., Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD). Apparently, specific sugars in human milk modify the receptors blocking the uptake of noroviruses and rotaviruses during the breast feeding phase. The maturation of the immune system during this period, subsequently, facilitates an effective immune response during the weaning period. The uptake of specific sialic acids, not produced in humans, but present in cow milk and meat products, beginning during the weaning time, results in their incorporation into the cell surface glycoproteins and gangliosides. The resulting modification of cell surface receptors alters their susceptibility to specific viral infections, e.g., human polyomavirus type 9 and others. Current analyses suggest that these receptors now permit the binding of infectious agents present in dairy cattle serum and milk products, leading to their longtime persistence and latency and their potential pathogenicity under conditions of reactivation. Thus, the protective effects of breast feeding, which allows for the maturation of the immune response during the first years of life, emerges as critical period, which determines the uptake and latency of specific infections (7).",

            "text": "Chronic respiratory morbidity is common in prematurely born infants and has a multifactorial aetiology (8). Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV increase this morbidity. Although prematurely born infants are functionally (9,10) and genetically (11) predisposed to RSV LRTIs, their lung function in infancy is worse after the LRTI (12,13). RSV LRTIs have more long-term effects, as evidenced by very prematurely born infants, who have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and then subsequently suffer from an RSV LRTI hospitalisation; in the first 2 years after birth these infants need increased healthcare utilisation and have poorer pulmonary functions at school age (14). There are limited data to suggest that rhinovirus (RV) may adversely affect on respiratory-related outcomes in prematurely born infants. In a previous study, in 8 prematurely born infants with BPD, the development of RV LRTIs was associated with a sustained worsening of their clinical status, requiring the addition of novel therapies for prolonged periods of time (15). Furthermore, in another study, prematurely born infants, who had developed RV LRTI, during infancy, had higher health-care utilisation costs, including greater numbers of hospital, outpatient and respiratory-related general practitioner (GP) attendances, than infants without a viral LRTI (16).",

The RV group had a poorer lung function than those who had not suffered an LRTI during infancy. Cluster analysis of the data demonstrated that infants with an extremely low birthweight requiring prolonged ventilation were at an increased risk of suffering from an RV LRTI in infancy and had higher healthcare utilisation and impaired lung function at school age (18). These data suggest that both RSV and RV LRTI increase chronic respiratory morbidity in prematurely born infants and, as a consequence, this should be taken into consideration regarding the development of relevant preventative strategies.",

The risk of MTCT of HBV is highest in infants born to younger mothers, who are HBeAg-positive and with high viral loads. Vaccination with <3 doses is also a risk factor for MTCT of HBV. Testing pregnant women for HBsAg, treating those positive before delivery and administering the birth dose and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) to infants at birth can successfully prevent MTCT of HBV (34). The rate of MTCT of HBV can be reduced by caesarian section delivery (35), with breast feeding not posing a risk factor for MTCT of HBV (36). By contrast, neither the mode of delivery nor the type of feeding has been shown to be a risk factor for MTCT in the case of HCV (37). HIV co-infection doubles the risk of MTCT of HCV (38).",

Additionally, asymptomatic infections of the oral or tonsillar mucosa, as well as of the genital mucosa in children have been described (46,47). Studies on HPV seropositivity in young children indicate a relatively low prevalence of HPV antibodies (approximately 0\u201310%) (48). The seroprevalence significantly increases in adolescence with the commencement of sexual activity. Mucosal HPV infection is often described as a sexually transmitted infection; however, the presence of such infections in infants and young children suggests that the virus may also be vertically and horizontally transmitted. There is strong evidence that maternal HPV cervical infection at the time of delivery can be transmitted to the newborn and there is a strong association between development of juvenile RRP and the presence of maternal genital warts during pregnancy (49). The detection of HPV DNA in spermatozoa and seminal plasma, as well as in amniotic fluid and placental tissue, suggests that periconceptual and prenatal transmission may also be possible (46,47). HPV can be transmitted horizontally (i.e., by kissing or touch) or to different sites by auto-inoculation (46,47). In the case of anogenital warts in particular, sexual abuse remains an important consideration. There are a lack of data on the persistence of HPV infections in children and their relation to the subsequent development of HPV-associated diseases, such as oropharyngeal carcinoma.",

The Nobelist laureate Professor Harald zur Hausen has actively advocated the vaccination of boys for the eradication of HPV infection and has emphasised that male HPV vaccination should be included into the current vaccination programmes. His publication with Professor Karin Michels from Harvard Medical School entitled \u2018HPV vaccine for all\u2019 and published in 2009 in Lancet has been one of the very first publications advocating the vaccination of boys (50). To date, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Austria have currently implemented routine vaccination of girls as well as boys (51\u201353). The recent WHO guidelines recommended the vaccination of girls aged 9\u201314 years as the primary target population, and the vaccination of additional target populations (females 15 years and older, and males) only if feasible, affordable and cost-effective (54). Gender-neutral vaccination may achieve greater herd protection effects and direct protection of males; however gender-neutral programmes have only been implemented recently and their impact on HPV-related diseases at a population level remains to be determined (54). Nevertheless, there are strong data that quadrivalent HPV vaccination is effective in reducing anal intraepithelial neoplasia (50% reduction in the intention-to-treat population and 78% in the per-protocol population) (55). Similar prospective data for penile cancers and oropharyngeal cancers is lacking; however, there are data suggesting that HPV infections at these sites are reduced following vaccination (56,57).",

In addition to their efficient mode of introduction as a nasal spray, in randomised clinical trials, they have been shown to provide better protective efficacy than inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in children, which are considered to be the main drivers of influenza transmission. However, recent observational studies have shown conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of LAIV. During the 2015/16 influenza season, a reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) was observed in the United States, and for this reason the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommended the use of the IIV and the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), instead of the LAIV for the 2016/17 season (62). However, in 2015/16, in the UK, Finland and Canada, LAIV VE was shown to be protective against the drifted influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses and with suboptimal effectiveness only against A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to IIV (63\u201365). Studies have attributed the reduced effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 to the thermal instability of this virus component and the handling conditions of the vaccines (66).",

Further studies are warranted to determine the reasons for reduced VE. A recent systematic literature review did not find any evidence of the decreased efficacy of LAIV when administered during two consecutive seasons (67). On the other hand, the findings of a study that evaluated the impact of repeated vaccination among health care workers were suggestive of decreased serological response among the highly vaccinated group (68). Another consortium, Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Effectiveness II (SIVE II), is currently evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the LAIV programme in children (69). The vaccination of healthy children has the potential to provide both direct protection to children, but also indirect protection to vulnerable groups in the general population. Further studies with large sample sizes and a greater number of people in the vaccine-na\u00efve group and in groups with repeated vaccinations are required. Population-based national health registries are also valuable to generate routine data for measuring the vaccination impact in a timely manner. As the LAIV use has been shown to be beneficial over the past years, continuous enhanced surveillance and further study results are required in order to better understand the USA findings and the possible implications for vaccination policies in Europe and worldwide.",

Prebiotics (e.g., Fructo- and Galacto-oligosaccharides) are non-viable food components, which can confer a significant health benefit on the host by modulating intestinal microflora. Synbiotics are a combination of pro- and prebiotics. The gut microflora is a complex ecosystem supporting the structure and function of the intestinal mucosa. Probiotics have the ability to modify the gut microflora either by lowering colonic pH through production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), or by producing antimicrobial compounds and antitoxins, and or by competing with other bacteria for nutrients.

Infections of the CNS are a very common worldwide health problem in childhood with significant morbidity and mortality. In children, viruses are the most common cause of CNS infections, followed by bacteria, and less frequently by fungi and other causes. Advances in the prenatal and perinatal care together with technological advent of imaging modalities have enabled timely detection and detailed exploration of symptoms and signs in the neonatal population starting from the fetal life. Although imaging is practically unable to set the diagnosis of viral infection in the fetuses and neonates, moreover to reveal the pathogens, it has, however, the potential to accurately suggest this scenario, map the extent of involvement and direct the investigation and the consultation accordingly. Additionally, it may reveal complications from viral infections that may cause confusion and usually require special treatment (81).",

In previously healthy neonates with viral infection, the imaging investigation of CNS begins with head ultrasound and if further imaging investigation is required, MRI is the modality of choice, even in an emergency setting (86).

It remains to be clarified though, whether it is the specific viral respiratory infection that plays the causative role in asthmatogenesis or whether viral-induced wheezing is just a marker of predisposed individuals for the subsequent development of asthma (104). It has been well demonstrated that there is an interaction of host factors with viral respiratory infections that promote recurrent virus-induced wheezing and the subsequent development of asthma (101). The synergistic interaction between allergies and viruses can be explained via various mechanisms, such as interferon deficiency, Th2-biased immunity, defective anti-inflammatory response, airway hyper responsiveness and reduced barrier function (97,103). In a recent randomised trial of 429 high-risk infants, treatment with palivizumab of otherwise healthy preterm infants in order to avoid a serious RSV infection was associated with decreased recurrent wheezing rate when compared with the placebo group (105). RSV causes cytopathic damage to the airway epithelium and by that can affect the function of the epithelium and airway smooth muscle (100).",

Certain features of infection with RV, including the stimulation of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and eotaxin production; the immigration of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, macrophages and neutrophils); and subsequent increases in factors considered important for airway remodeling (such as NO and vascular endothelial growth factor), point to the likelihood that RV infection is asthmatogenic (106). Given the burden of asthma, it is of utmost importance that future scientific attempts reveal in detail the causality between viral infections and asthmatogenesis. Thus, better asthma-predictive indices can be developed and more effective strategies for asthma prevention can be scheduled, including research for effective vaccines.",

Although excavated 70 years ago, the details of its contents were never published. As estimated from long bone lengths, the age of the infants ranged from 26 weeks in utero to 6 months post-term, with a peak at 38\u201340 weeks (110). The cause of death for the infants in the Agora\u2019s well has been the topic of much speculation over the past 70 years. Suggestions have included war-related famine or epidemic disease, human sacrifice and large-scale infanticide. One of the goals of this project was to evaluate the evidence for pathologies in the infants in order to evaluate the causes of death. Infant death rates from natural causes in the ancient world were very high, and up to 50% of neonates may have died early in the postnatal period (111). In addition, approximately 15% of these skeletons are from infants born pre-term, as young as 26 weeks in utero. Many of these were probably either stillborn or died from complications associated with prematurity, including respiratory distress and problems with thermoregulation.",

Lesions have also been identified on the parietal and frontal bones, often in areas of venous drainage. The greater wing and body of the sphenoid bone also exhibited endocranial proliferative bone lesions. It has been found that that lesions extending beyond the cruciate eminence of the occipital, and hair-on-end lesions are more likely to be pathological, rather than indicative of than normal bone growth (112).
