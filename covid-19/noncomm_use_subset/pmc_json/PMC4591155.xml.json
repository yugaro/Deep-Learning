Three main parameters need to be selected when\nfitting an ARIMA model: the orders of autoregressive (AR), differencing or integration (I),\nand moving average (MA). Autoregressive terms relate the the observation made at time\nt in the series to the observation made at time t-1, or\nto the observation made at t-2 and so on. Moving average terms relate the\nerror (difference between observation and estimated value) at time t to the\nerror at times t-1, t-2, etc. If the time series data\ncontain a stochastic trend (that is, if the data contain a unit root), differencing is\nperformed to eliminate the trend and to obtain a stationary process. The introduction of the\nprinciple of ARIMA model is described briefly by Trottier et al. [27], and the detailed introduction to this method is\navailable in the textbook by Brockwell et al. [6]. We examined unit roots in residual data by using the Augmented Dickey\nFuller-test (ADF test) [8, 9]. These coefficients of the ARIMA model were estimated using the Arima\nfunction in R [13] by monitoring Akaike\u2019s information\ncriterion (AIC). The estimation used data obtained between April 2003 and March 2011 and was\nperformed under the conditions of AR (p) with 0\u2264p\u2264 5 and MA (q) with 0\u2264q\u22645.\nSince the ensemble average with overall mean was subtracted according to Brockwell\u2019s method,\nthe estimation was performed without a constant term. At the same time, we compared both\nconditions with and without drift on the basis of the AIC.",

In order to prove the robustness of the model, we replaced the last actual\ncondemned numbers of the training phase (determined by either AR or MA) with an equal number\nof the numbers generated randomly as follows. The numbers were drawn from a Poisson\ndistribution with the shape parameter lambda (\u03bb) of the 8-year observed data at the training\nphase and were subtracted by week ensemble average. We then re-fitted the ARIMA model for\nthe updated AR and MA based on the least AIC. Then, the differences in deviance between the\n2 predicted models (model 1: predicted by using ensemble average-subtracted actual observed\ndata and model 2: the last few days of the training phase were replaced with randomly\ngenerated numbers as stated above) at the validation phase were tested for significance at a\nlevel of P<0.05 using chi-squared statistics.

Although the prevalence at the animal\nlevel is quite low as it was shown in the results, sporadic cases of swine mycobacteriosis\noccur commonly at the farm level. Morita et al. reported that sporadic\ninfections of MAIC were detected in 870 of 1,200 piggeries (72.5%) between 1988 and 1990 at\na slaughterhouse in Gunma Prefecture, Japan [21].\nDistinguishing the outbreaks from sporadic cases based on daily raw abattoir data is\ntherefore not easy; however, a time series analysis in this study demonstrated the\nfeasibility of its practical application in the real-time detection. The detection of the\noutbreaks is important, because of the public health impact to consumers and economic impact\nto producers of the disease, as stated in the introduction. Komijn et al.\nsuggested that pigs may be an important vehicle for M. avium infections in\nhumans [16]. Real-time detection of the outbreak at\nthe farm level can minimize public health risks by careful detection of the rest of the\ncarcasses of the day and can help the responsible producer to improve farm hygiene\nimmediately. Such collaborative effort between meat inspection and livestock hygiene service\nwould be effective in controlling zoonotic diseases [1].",

Similar temporal patterns in the daily number of\ncondemned intestines among the days of a week seen in both the whole dataset between 2003\nand 2011, and the days which exceeded the average condemnation rate also supported the\nvalidity of this time series modeling. Traditionally, the statistical processing for\nabattoir data in Japan has been used only to calculate monthly and annual total incidences.\nHence, by the traditional statistical analysis, outbreaks of diseases might not be\nrecognized until total slaughter numbers were obtained, causing a lag in the potential\ndetection of non-sporadic events. Therefore, the application of time series analysis, as\nused in this study, may accelerate the rapid detection of outbreaks.",

            "text": "While this study demonstrated the above-stated strengths, our analysis has three\nlimitations. First, sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of mycobacteriosis are not\ntaken into account. The meat inspection for mycobacteriosis in swine intestines is based on\nvisual examination, and misdiagnosis may happen. However, restrictions in expense and time\nprecluded our investigation of the sensitivity and the specificity of the histopathology\nexaminations. In fact, unless molecular technology is used, classical tests would miss some\ninfections. A study using 239 lymph nodes from pig carcasses with caseous lesions showed\nsensitivity of 79.1% by Ziel-Neelsen stain (189 positive) and 69.5% by culture [16], and the kappa value (agreement) of these tests,\ncalculated from the published data, was 0.016, which is interpreted to be slight agreement\n[10]. Second, a separate (though related)\nlimitation is that the present study selected the number of condemned intestines in\nabattoirs due to mycobacteriosis as an objective variable. The prevalence rate among pigs\nslaughtered on a given day might be better variable for modeling to identify suspected\noutbreaks accurately, as disease is a binary response [12]. However, mycobacteriosis is a rare disease with low annual condemned rate\n(0.36% in fiscal year 2012), which makes the data heavily zero-inflated and over-dispersed.\nThird, the present model does not take background farm size into account in detecting\noutbreak of mycobacteriosis. There is a concern that the model may miss an outbreak of a\nsmall-scale farm, and on the other hand, it may be so sensitive against prevalence of the\ndisease in large-scale farm that even sporadic cases may be detected. However, as Fig. 6 showed, the level of detection is low enough to\ndetect outbreak even in the small-scale farms. Moreover, large-scale farms have multiple\nproduction units, and outbreaks can occur within a unit. Thus, the present model can detect\nsuch outbreaks at a sale to slaughterhouse, and we think this would not be a notable\nlimitation.",
