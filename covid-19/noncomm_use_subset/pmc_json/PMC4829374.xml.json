The table was designed to highlight the differences in definitions of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention between Leavell & Clark and you & Roland. To emphasize the fact that Leavell & Clark did not mention quaternary prevention (QP), I kept a blank in the Status column. In addition, I mentioned \u2018the framework of primary-secondary-tertiary prevention that was proposed by Leavell and Clark in the 1940s\u2019 in the second sentence. To clarify the fact, I agree with your suggestion to use a red line to delineate the concepts of each pair of authors.",

However, I have two reasons for emphasizing that clinical epidemiologists play a key role in QP. The first is that the Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2015 spread to patients admitted to a hospital. To control the epidemic, I emphasized the role of infection epidemiologists in hospitals. The second is that pharmaco-epidemiology including pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting for managing the preventable harms of drugs could be covered in the scope of clinical epidemiology.",
