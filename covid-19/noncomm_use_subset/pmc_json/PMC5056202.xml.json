The outbreak was amplified by superspreading events in hospitals and resulted in 186 laboratory-confirmed cases with 38 fatalities, the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula (45). Factors contributing to the large hospital outbreaks included delay in diagnosis of the index case, overcrowding in emergency departments, movements of patients prior to diagnoses, and suboptimal infection prevention and control (6). During the outbreak, almost 17,000 individuals with an epidemiologic risk were quarantined for monitoring, and all the laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to the hospitals for isolation as soon as the diagnoses were made. Consequently, the Korean outbreak provided a unique opportunity to conduct prospective studies on MERS-CoV infection.",

To better understand immunopathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection, we assessed host immune responses to and viral kinetics of MERS-CoV infection. We recently reported the viral shedding kinetics (10) and antibody response kinetics (11). However, the innate immune response to MERS-CoV infection and the role of most cytokines in disease severity remains unclear. Here, we report detailed clinical course and cytokine profiles in patients with MERS-CoV infection. We also evaluated the association between the cytokine profiles and severity of illness.",

In this study, however, most patients had pneumonia in week 1, but their symptoms were not so severe that they did not feel they needed to stay at home (\u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d). Dyspnea requiring oxygen supplementation and sudden progression of pneumonia usually developed during the second week. Similar to SARS (16), the median time from symptom onset to ventilator support was 11 days. Because of this clinical progression of initial mild symptoms followed by sudden clinical deterioration, patients with MERS-CoV infection may present at emergency room (ER).

MERS-CoV is known to inhibit recognition, delay IFN induction, and sequester IFN stimulated gene production until after peak viral titers had been achieved (20). In a fatal MERS case, the patient could not induce the expression of key receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) in response to MERS-CoV infection (21). This resulted in a decreased expression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 leading to a decreased expression of IFN-\u03b1. In our study, the serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 in the severe MERS group was more frequently high than the mild group, even if we could not demonstrate any statistical significance. To the contrary, there was no apparent IFN-\u03b1 response in the mild group (Fig. 2A). The level of IFN-\u03b1 was also correlated with the log value of maximal RNA copies (Fig. 3A). Taken together, IFN-\u03b1 seems to surge during the clinical course of MERS in patients having severe disease with high viral loads but not in patients having mild disease. The absence of INF-\u03b1 surge in severe cases of disease was related to worse outcome in previous study (21), but we could not conclude the association of outcome with the serum level of IFN-\u03b1 due to a limited number of fatal cases. Moreover, it is possible that the levels of serum INF-\u03b1 merely reflected the level of exogenously injected pegylated IFN-\u03b12a in this study. Therefore, the results of levels of serum INF-\u03b1 should be read cautiously.",

            "text": "CXCL-10, also known as IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), is a chemoattractant which is expressed in inflammed bronchial epithelial cells in response to IFN-\u03b3. CXCL-10 seems to play an important role in severe respiratory viral illnesses. Uncontrolled durable secretion of CXCL-10, after the first week following the onset of symptoms was associated with poor outcome in a severe MERS case (21). High serum level of CXCL-10 was also documented in other severe respiratory viral illnesses such as severe A/H7N9 avian influenza (24), A/H5N1 avian influenza (7), severe seasonal influenza (22), and SARS (9). In this study the levels of serum CXCL-10 were significantly higher in the severe MERS group than in the mild group in the second and third week of illness (Supplementary Fig. 2). During the clinical course, the serum levels of CXCL-10 and IL-6 showed a peak around second week after symptom onset in the severe group (Fig. 2C). This dynamic in proinflammatory cytokine response shows a good temporal correlation with chest infiltrates showing a peak at second weeks after symptom onset in severe MERS cases. Therefore, our study suggests that elevated levels of serum IL-6 and CXCL-10 may be associated with the severity of pneumonia in MERS.",

Nine patients received pegylated INF-\u03b12a, which could affect serum level of INF-\u03b1 and other cytokine profiles through cytokine feedback cascades. However, in each group the IL-6 and CXCL-10 profiles were similar regardless of the administration of pegylated INF-\u03b12a. Also subset analysis including the patients who did not received interferon therapy showed similar trends (Supplementary Fig. 4). In spite of these limitations, this study has strengths in that we collected clinical data and serum samples serially in prospective manner and diverse cytokine or chemokine levels were measured in this newly emerging disease.",
