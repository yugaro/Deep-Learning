            "text": "Sepsis is defined as the presence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection, and is one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units (ICUs); currently, there are more than 19 million cases of sepsis a year worldwide (Rangel-Frausto et al., 1995; Angus et al., 2001; Funk et al., 2009; Angus and van der Poll, 2013). Although the mechanism is not clear, SIRS and an associated infection can develop into severe sepsis, a robust and uncontrollable inflammatory response, which can lead to septic shock and subsequent death (Cerra, 1985; Angus and van der Poll, 2013). Multiple proinflammatory reactions are thought to contribute to the severity of sepsis pathologies (Angus and van der Poll, 2013). These overlapping proinflammatory responses create a complex biological scenario with built-in redundancies, making it difficult to study. Additionally, the proinflammatory pathways that contribute to sepsis have not been fully defined, which compounds the difficulty in developing efficacious diagnostics and therapeutics. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular pathways that contribute to pathogenesis of sepsis is crucial for the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutic strategies and in reducing mortality.",

            "text": "Cell death coincides with the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn are associated with poor outcome in patients with sepsis (Ayala et al., 1996; Hotchkiss et al., 1997, 1999, 2003; Isogai et al., 1998; Oberholzer et al., 2001; van der Poll and Opal, 2008). Specifically, the caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death pathway has been shown by multiple groups to exacerbate pathologies in an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model (Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Hagar et al., 2013). Caspase-11 is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that plays a critical role in responding to cytosolic LPS during Gram-negative bacterial infection and sepsis (Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Aachoui et al., 2013; Hagar et al., 2013). In multiple cell types, caspase-11 expression is induced after initial detection of LPS by TLR4, through Myd88, TRIF, and interferon signaling pathways (Broz and Monack, 2011; Kayagaki et al., 2011; Rathinam et al., 2012; Hagar et al., 2013). Caspase-11 is produced as a monomeric zymogen that dimerizes and activates upon detection of cytosolic LPS (Kang et al., 2000). Upon activation of caspase-11, the cell succumbs to pyroptotic cell death, activates caspase-1, and releases proinflammatory mediators (Kang et al., 2000; Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Hagar et al., 2013). Caspase-11\u2013dependent release of proinflammatory mediators into the extracellular space during LPS-induced sepsis contributes to host mortality (Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Hagar et al., 2013). In humans, caspase-4 and -5 are orthologues to caspase-11 (Shi et al., 2014; Casson et al., 2015), making this an intriguing cell death pathway to understand in the context of sepsis. Thus, an increased understanding of the regulation of caspase-4/5/11\u2013dependent cell death pathway may lead to the identification of novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.",

The results of our screen highlight the complexity of caspase-11 gene expression. Specifically, we identified carboxypeptidase B1 (Cpb1), a complement-related protein, as a novel mediator of caspase-11 gene expression and subsequent caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in macrophages. Cpb1 modifies a cleavage product of C3, which binds to and activates C3aR, and then modulates innate immune signaling. Here, we elucidate the role of the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway in enhancing cell autonomous and non\u2013cell autonomous inflammation by amplifying TLR4- and Ifnar-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes, including caspase-11, within macrophages. We find that TLR4- and Ifnar-signaling pathways, but not Ifngr signaling, converge at p38 MAPK signaling downstream of C3aR activation, highlighting the specificity of this amplification signaling pathway. We identified a role for C3aR, a key mediator of the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR signaling pathway, in the early production of proinflammatory mediators, including caspase-11, in vivo and to the severity and outcome of disease in an endotoxemia model of severe sepsis. Furthermore, using a C3aR inhibitor, we show that C3aR may be a candidate for early therapeutic targeting during sepsis.",

Treatment of WT RAW cells with LPS and CTB for 16 h results in death of \u223c80% of the cells, which is similar to WT BMDMs (Fig. 1 B).

We found that intracellular LPS induced cell death primarily in a caspase-11\u2013dependent, caspase-1\u2013independent manner (Fig. 1 B). Important to note, caspase-1 is directly upstream of caspase-11 on Chromosome 9 in C57BL/6J mice, thus we checked if disruption of either of these genes affected the other (Kang et al., 2000). Disruption of caspase-11 did not affect the protein levels of caspase-1, and vice versa (unpublished data). We went on to complement the disrupted caspase-11 gene by expressing a WT copy of caspase-11 tagged at the C terminus with FLAG/HA under the pMSCV promoter. The complemented cell line restored the cell death phenotype to 50% of the WT RAW cell death (Fig. 1 B).

As confirmation of our method, our top hit was B4galnt1, which is a gene required for the production of the CTB receptor (GM1 sphingolipid; Fig. 1 D; Wolf et al., 2008; Papatheodorou et al., 2011; Chinnapen et al., 2012; Jobling et al., 2012). Although caspase-11 was not enriched in our screen, it is possible that the caspase-11 gRNAs present in the library were ineffective or lost during amplification of the library. To verify four of our top novel hits, we created knockout RAW cell lines using the gRNAs identified from the screen and treated them with CTB and LPS for 16 h. RAW cells deficient for three of these hits showed a cell death defect after 16 h of CTB and LPS treatment, whereas the Acsl6 KO cell line displayed similar levels of cell death compared with WT RAW cells (Fig. 1 E). To ensure that these genes were required for caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death, and not CTB-dependent delivery of LPS into the cytosol, we transfected LPS into each knockout cell line. While most of our knockout cell lines had decreased levels of cell death after transfection with LPS compared with WT cells, only the Cpb1KO cell line displayed significant defects after treatment with CTB and LPS, as well as LPS transfection (Fig. 1 E). Together, these data demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screening method in RAW macrophages is a useful tool to identify novel genes, such as Cpb1, involved in the caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death pathway.",

We confirmed a significant reduction in cell death after 16-h treatment with intracellular LPS, via CTB or transfection, compared with WT RAW cells in one clone, Cpb1-10 (Fig. 1, G-H). We used a pan-carboxypeptidase inhibitor (2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid [MGTA]) to assess the importance of Cpb1 enzymatic activity during intracellular LPS treatment. We found that during CTB/LPS treatment of macrophages, the presence of MGTA reduces caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 I); thus, underlining the importance of the enzymatic activity of Cpb1 during caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death. Importantly, the cell death defect in Cpb1 KO cells was rescued by expressing a WT copy of Cpb1 under a pMSCV promoter (Fig. 1 J).",

Thus, we measured caspase-11 activation in WT and KO cell lines by detecting cleavage and release of the C-terminal p30 portion of full-length caspase-11 (pro-casp11) into the supernatant of activated and dying cells (Kang et al., 2000). 16 h pt of WT cells with CTB and LPS resulted in an increase of pro-casp11 and p30 into the supernatant (SN) as a result of caspase-11 activation and release of cytosolic contents upon cell death (Fig. 1 K). In concordance with our previous data, there were lower levels of pro-casp11 in the SN from Cpb1 KO cells compared with the WT cells after CTB and LPS treatment (Fig. 1 K). In addition, the caspase-11 p30 cleavage product was not detected in the SN from Cpb1 KO cells treated with LPS and CTB (Fig. 1 K). As expected, pro-casp11 and p30 were not detected in the SN from Casp11 KO cell line 16 h pt with LPS and CTB (Fig. 1 K). Interestingly, the level of pro-casp11 in the lysates of Cpb1 KO cells treated with LPS was markedly lower compared with the WT cells treated with LPS suggesting that Cpb1 may contribute to cell death by controlling the level of caspase-11 gene expression (Fig. 1 K). To test this notion, we expressed a WT copy of caspase-11 on an exogenous vector and measured cell death in response to LPS and CTB. Ectopic expression of caspase-11 in Cpb1-deficient cells rescues the cell death defect in response to cytosolic LPS (Fig. 1 J).",

To analyze the contribution of Cpb1 to TLR4-dependent caspase-11 gene expression, we treated WT and Cpb1 KO cells with LPS for 2 h to initiate TLR4-dependent expression of proinflammatory genes and measured expression of caspase-11 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine transcript levels. Similar to previous studies, the level of caspase-11 transcript in WT cells is significantly increased after 2-h treatment with extracellular LPS (Fig. 1 L). In contrast, the level of caspase-11 gene expression in the Cpb1 KO cell line did not increase after 2 h of extracellular LPS treatment (Fig. 1 L). Of note, caspase-1, which is not influenced by TLR4-dependent signaling, was unaffected in WT and Cpb1 KO cells (Fig. 1 L). Thus, our results indicate that Cpb1 is required for WT levels of caspase-11 expression, activation, and cell death in response to cytosolic LPS.",

Murine Cpb1 is the orthologue to human CPB, which modifies C3a, a 77-aa anaphylatoxin generated by enzymatic cleavage of C3 during activation of the complement system (Leung et al., 2008). CPB cleaves the C-terminal arginine of C3a to create C3a-desArg (Moore and Benoiton, 1978; Leung et al., 2008). This modified molecule, C3a-desArg, engages the C3aR receptor, a complement receptor that belongs to the rhodopsin family of seven transmembrane, G protein\u2013coupled receptors expressed on both BM-derived myeloid and lymphoid cells (Crass et al., 1996; Martin et al., 1997; Zwirner et al., 1999). Activation of C3aR leads to modulation of innate immune responses during LPS stimulation and Gram-negative bacterial infections, including induction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF (Takabayashi et al., 1996; Mueller-Ortiz et al., 2006). C3aR activation has been shown to mediate expression of TLR4-dependent transcripts (Zhang et al., 2007). Thus, Cpb1 may modulate TLR4-dependent expression of proinflammatory cytokines through complement receptor C3aR (see also Fig. 7).",

Finally, to further test the role of C3aR in caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in BMDMs, C3aR-dependent signaling was blocked by adding the C3a receptor antagonist (C3aR-Ant).

Although we have shown that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway amplifies proinflammatory transcripts, including caspase-11, downstream of TLR4 activation, it is not known whether the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway directly modulates Ifnar or Ifngr signaling. To activate Ifnar signaling, primary macrophages were treated with IFN-\u03b2, and the levels of caspase-11 and NOS2, Ifnar-dependent transcripts, were measured. As expected, there was an amplification of caspase-11 and NOS2 transcripts in WT BMDMs treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the levels of caspase-11 and NOS2 transcripts were significantly lower in the C3aR\u2212/\u2212 and C3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h compared with WT BMDMs (Fig. 3 A). In addition, we activated BMDMs with IFN-\u03b3 and measured up-regulation of the IFN-\u03b3\u2013dependent genes caspase-11 and NOS2. Interestingly, WT, C3aR\u2212/\u2212, and C3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages expressed caspase-11 and NOS2 transcripts at similar levels after 2 h of stimulation with IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these data indicate that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR signaling pathway is important for amplification of Ifnar-dependent signaling, but not Ifngr-dependent signaling, during the first 2 h after cytokine stimulation. Surprisingly, this is the first demonstration of C3aR-dependent amplification of Ifnar-dependent signaling. Our results indicate that signaling through the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway amplifies TLR4-dependent signaling and type I interferon-stimulated Ifnar signaling in macrophages, but not Ifngr-dependent signaling (see also Fig. 7).",

Thus, we hypothesize that Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway amplification of TLR4- and Ifnar-dependent gene expression converges on MAPK signaling within the host cell. We measured phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase as a read-out of MAPK family activity, to identify the level of MAP kinase activation in WT versus complement-deficient macrophages after various stimuli. After 2 h of treatment with LPS, p38 phosphorylation in WT BMDMs increases sixfold, whereas the C3aR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs show approximately twofold induction of p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, when BMDMs are treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h, there is a twofold increase of p38 phosphorylation in WT cells compared with a less than onefold induction in C3aR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. In congruence with our hypothesis, p38 phosphorylation was not induced in IFN-\u03b3\u2013treated WT or C3aR\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs (Fig. 3 C).

Thus, we hypothesize that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway will be required for caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death during S. Typhimurium and S. flexneri infections. During S. Typhimurium infection, \u223c30% of WT RAW cells are dead 18 h after infection (MOI, 100:1), whereas infected Casp11 KO RAW cells exhibited no detectable cell death above background (\u223c10%; Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the levels of cell death in Cpb1 KO, C3aR KO, and C3 KO cell lines infected with S. Typhimurium were similar to those in the infected Casp11 KO cell line (Fig. 4 A). Additionally, RAW macrophages require caspase-11 for WT levels of macrophage cell death after 18 h infection with S. flexneri (MOI 50:1; Fig. 4 B; Kayagaki et al., 2015). Cpb1, C3, and C3aR are also required for WT levels of cell death during S. flexneri infection (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, the Cpb1, C3, and C3aR phenotypes cannot be explained by defective bacterial uptake (unpublished data).",

We have shown here that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway is important for caspase-11 induced gene expression and subsequent caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in vitro. We hypothesize that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway contributes to the severity of endotoxemia by regulating the expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as caspase-11, in vivo. To interrogate this hypothesis, we established a mouse model in which mice receive an i.p. injection with a sublethal dose of LPS, followed by an i.p. injection of a lethal dose of LPS to induce endotoxemia. Proinflammatory gene expression in blood was measured at 2 h after the sublethal LPS injection. Disease severity was assessed after injection of the lethal LPS injection by measuring body temperature and weight loss every 2\u20134 h pt (Marshall et al., 2005; Gonnert et al., 2011; Gentile et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Furthermore, we were interested to know if we could pharmacologically block C3aR activation and decrease the severity of pathologies in mice with endotoxemia. We used a selective nonpeptide antagonist of C3aR (C3aRi; SB290157), shown to be effective in vivo, to block C3aR activation in our mouse model (Ames et al., 2001). Mice injected with a sublethal dose of LPS and the C3aR inhibitor displayed a reduced level of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood compared with mice that were not given the antagonist (Fig. 5, E and F). After the first injection (6 h), these same mice were injected with a lethal dose of LPS and C3aRi and weight and temperature were recorded to track endotoxemia severity. As seen in the C3aR\u2212/\u2212 mice, mice treated with the C3aRi had significantly less weight loss (Fig. 5 G). However, the mice treated with C3aRi did not have a difference in temperature loss compared with untreated mice (Fig. 5 H). Notably, the levels of IL-6 detected in the blood of mice treated with C3aRi were significantly lower than control mice 2 h after injection of low dose LPS (Fig. 5 I). These data suggest C3aR as a potential therapeutic target for decreasing endotoxemia severity, and highlight a bifurcation in weight loss and temperature loss during sepsis that may be interesting to uncover in future experiments. Finally, we determined whether treatment of mice with C3aRi during endotoxemia could influence survival. We induced endotoxemia in WT mice, with and without C3aRi, and found that mice treated with C3aRi are partially protected from LPS-induced mortality (Fig. 5 J). Together, these data suggest that C3aR, a key mediator in the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway, plays a role in early expression of inflammatory mediators in the blood during endotoxemia and contributes to endotoxemia severity and disease outcome.",

There is evidence that expression of caspase-4 and -5 is induced upon host cell exposure to LPS; however, the role of this induction in inflammation is not clear (Munday et al., 1995; Lin et al., 2000; Eckhart et al., 2006; Casson et al., 2015; Vigan\u00f2 et al., 2015). Additionally, it is not known what signaling pathways contribute to expression of these caspases downstream of TLR4. Considering our data presented thus far, we hypothesize that C3aR may be required for early induction of caspase-4 and -5 and subsequent inflammation. Thus, we first tested the early kinetics of caspase-4 and -5 expression in MDMs after treatment with LPS. We found that both pro-caspase-4 and -5 were induced after 3 h of stimulation compared with the untreated control (Ctrl; Fig. 6 A). Additionally, at 3 h pt we can detect higher levels of p20 fragment of caspase-5, a potential indicator of caspase-5 activation, in the LPS-treated samples compared with the Ctrl (Fig. 6 A). Thus, caspase-4 and -5 expression, and possibly caspase-5 activation, is induced by LPS treatment within 3 h in MDMs.",

At 3 h pt, C3aRi-treated MDMs expressed lower levels of pro-caspase-4 and -5 (Fig. 6 B). Additionally, the caspase-5 p20 fragment was not detected after 3 h of LPS and C3aRi treatment in MDMs (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, our results in mouse macrophages suggest that C3aR is amplifying proinflammatory mediators via increasing p38 MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar activation, but not Ifngr activation (Fig. 3, A\u2013C). Considering these data, we propose that C3aR is modulating inflammatory signaling pathways in human macrophages similar to what was found in mouse cells. To test this, we treated MDMs with LPS, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 for 3 h and looked at fold-change of p38-phosphorylation. As seen in the mouse macrophages, in human MDMs p38 phosphorylation increases with LPS and IFN-\u03b2 stimulation and does not increase in the IFN-\u03b3 or untreated cells (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, when the MDMs were simultaneously treated with C3aRi and LPS or IFN-\u03b2, the induction of p38 phosphorylation was blocked (Fig. 6 C). Thus our data indicate that, in human and mouse macrophages, C3aR activation is required for induction of MAPK activity through phosphorylation of p38 downstream of LPS and IFN-\u03b2, but not IFN-\u03b3.",

We found that across eight cohorts that matched inclusion criteria (Reghunathan et al., 2005; Ramilo et al., 2007; Chaussabel et al., 2008; Ardura et al., 2009; Ioannidis et al., 2012; Severino et al., 2014; Brand et al., 2015), the expression of caspase-5 was significantly higher in adults experiencing sepsis verses healthy donors (Fig. 6 E), suggesting a potential role for caspase-5 in human sepsis. There was no significant change in the expression of caspase-4 in septic patients (unpublished data). Thus, these data find a bifurcation in the induction of caspase-4 and -5 transcripts, highlighting a potential evolutionary divergence in requirement for these caspases during severe sepsis in humans. Notably, we also found that c3aR1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in PBMCs in patients with sepsis (Fig. 6 E), suggesting an important role for both caspase-5 and C3aR-signaling in clinical sepsis. Together, these data elucidate the role of C3aR as a mediator of inflammation in primary human macrophages and demonstrated increased expression of C3aR and caspase-5 transcripts in the blood, highlighting the possibility of using these transcripts as diagnostic markers of severe septic patients.",

            "text": "The multifaceted inflammatory response during sepsis has made the contribution of specific proinflammatory pathways difficult to delineate; however, it is known that caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death contributes to poor sepsis outcomes in model organisms (Kayagaki et al., 2011, 2013; Hagar et al., 2013). Considering the importance of this cell death pathway in disease severity, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system to create a genome-wide unbiased screen in macrophages to look for unique mediators of caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death. Using this screen, we identified Cpb1 as a novel mediator of caspase-11 expression and subsequent caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in macrophages (Fig. 1). Cpb1 is a protein that modifies C3a, an anaphylatoxin product from cleaved complement protein C3, which binds and activates C3aR to modulate immune responses (Takabayashi et al., 1996; Mueller-Ortiz et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2008; Fig. 7). Disruption of Cbp1, C3, and C3aR led to a decrease in expression of caspase-11, and other proinflammatory mediators by reducing p38 MAPK activity, downstream of LPS-dependent activation of TLR4 and type-I interferon activation of Ifnar, but not type-II interferon activation of Ifngr signaling (Fig. 1, L\u2013M; Fig. 2; and Fig. 3, A\u2013C). Interestingly, we show the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway amplifies inflammatory responses in both a cell autonomous and non\u2013cell autonomous manner (Fig. 1\u20133). As seen in Cpb1 KO cells, disruption of C3 and C3aR led to a reduction in caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death (Fig. 2, C and F). Thus, we have elucidated complement as a novel mediator of caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death, through the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR signaling pathway.",

Typhimurium and S. flexneri infection (Fig. 4, A\u2013C). Furthermore, in a model of severe endotoxin-induced sepsis, C3aR\u2212/\u2212 mice had lower levels of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood and moderate pathologies compared with WT mice (Fig. 5, A\u2013D). We went on to show that inactivation of C3aR with a small nonpeptide C3aR inhibitor (C3aRi) reduces levels of caspase-11 and il-6 transcripts in the blood, IL-6 cytokines levels in the blood, weight loss during severe sepsis, and increased survival, suggesting C3aR may be a useful therapeutic target for mediating inflammation during the early stages of sepsis which may influence disease outcome (Fig. 5, E\u2013J).",

The reduction inflammatory transcripts were reflected in a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine release when cells were treated with C3aRi (Fig. 6 D). Furthermore, we found, by multicohort gene expression analysis, that a caspase-11 orthologue, caspase-5, and c3aR transcripts are up-regulated in PBMCs in clinical sepsis compared with healthy controls, implicating this signaling pathway in humans experiencing sepsis (Fig. 6 E). Together, these data demonstrate that the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR signaling pathway as an important mediator of caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death, which is important for the response to Gram-negative bacteria and for severity of pathologies during sepsis.

In agreement with this hypothesis, transfection of recombinant C3 into macrophages during stimulation with intracellular LPS does not rescue the Cpb1 KO cell death phenotype (unpublished data). These preliminary results further suggest that the enzymatic activity of Cpb1 is required for this signaling pathway to amplify caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death during intracellular LPS stimulation.

It is known that an increase in free Arg can induce iNOS production in macrophages (Moncada and Higgs, 1991; Bogle et al., 1992; Xia and Zweier, 1997; Lee et al., 2003). Increased iNOS can play a very important role in worsening sepsis outcome and may play a role in induction of caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death (Lupfer et al., 2014). Thus, it is possible that Cpb1 may be contributing to caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death via induction of iNOS. However, when we stimulate WT and iNOS-deficient (iNOS\u2212/\u2212) BMDMs with intracellular LPS, there is no difference in cell death outcome (unpublished data). Accordingly, iNOS is not contributing to caspase-11\u2013dependent cell death in macrophages; therefore, we conclude the contribution of an increase in free Arg by Cpb1 is not playing a role in our model.",

Amplification of TLR signaling by C3aR has been noted previously (Zhang et al., 2007); however, this is the first time that C3aR has been described to affect Ifnar signaling, and these data suggest that signaling downstream of this receptor may be more pleotropic than previously presumed. Notably, we find C3aR is modulating p38 MAPK activity downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar, but not Ifngr, activation. Our data suggests that C3aR directly acts on p38 to induce activity, or another protein downstream of TLR and Ifnar, but upstream of p38. It will be interesting to elucidate the mechanism by which C3aR signaling modifies these signaling pathways, and if there other signaling pathways that are affected by C3aR activation during inflammation.",

TLR4 and Ifnar activation through their respective ligands induce expression of proinflammatory genes via various mechanisms, including the induction of p38 MAPK (Lee et al., 1994; Sanc\u00e9au et al., 2000). C3 expression is induced downstream these pathways (Riches et al., 1988; Maranto et al., 2011), and is quickly released from macrophages (Goodrum, 1987), where it is cleaved into C3a and C3b. Anaphylotoxin C3a can be cleaved extracellularly by Cpb1 into C3a-desArg (Leung et al., 2008; Chatterjee et al., 2009), where it then acts as a ligand for C3aR. We find, the activation of C3aR then amplifies MAPK activity through enhancing p38 MAPK phosphorylation downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar, but not Ifngr, activation. Due to the extracellular nature of this signaling pathway, the Cpb1\u2013C3\u2013C3aR pathway acts as a cell-autonomous and a non\u2013cell autonomous amplification pathway enhancing expression of proinflammatory genes of self- and neighboring macrophages.",
