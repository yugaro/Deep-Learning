            "text": "Previous reports showed that TREM\u20101 activation leads to the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines through nuclear factor \u03baB activation, which also regulates the expression of TREM\u20101, providing a positive feedback loop on the expression of the receptor.4 Proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in ALD1, 2, 3, 23, 24; therefore, we hypothesized that TREM\u20101 signaling contributes to the amplification of proinflammatory pathways in ALD. To evaluate this hypothesis, first we tested whole\u2010liver mRNAs of EtOH\u2010fed and PF mice with or without treatment with two different TREM\u20101 inhibitory formulations and a vehicle control in a 5\u2010week alcohol administration model of ALD in mice.25 We found that mRNA levels of TREM\u20101 and MCP\u20101 were significantly increased in livers of alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls (Fig. 1A,B). In contrast, in mice treated with the TREM\u20101 inhibitors, both GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL inhibited alcohol\u2010related changes in TREM\u20101; in addition, MCP\u20101 mRNA levels corresponded to those of the PF controls (Fig. 1A,B). Although induction of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u00df in alcohol\u2010fed mice did not reach statistical significance compared to PF controls, TREM\u20101 blockade by GF9\u2010HDL resulted in a significant inhibition of TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA in the alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to vehicle treatment (Fig. 1C), while IL\u20101\u00df mRNA expression was also significantly attenuated by both the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL formulations in the alcohol\u2010fed as well as in the PF groups (Fig. 1D). MIP\u20101\u03b1 mRNA levels were increased in alcohol\u2010fed mice, but TREM\u20101 blockade with GF9\u2010HDL or GA/E31\u2010HDL significantly attenuated this increase compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 1E). Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES) mRNA levels did not change regardless of alcohol feeding or TREM\u20101 treatment (Fig. 1 F).",

Mechanistically, the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL formulations target the liver more efficiently than only the peptides alone and release the TREM\u20101 inhibitory sequences inside the target cells where these peptides likely inhibit TREM\u20101 signaling by disrupting the intramembrane interactions of the TREM\u20101 receptor and its signaling adaptor molecule DNAX activation protein of 12kDa [Correction made 31 October, 2018.

This is in line with our previous studies where GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL exhibited similar therapeutic activities in cancer and arthritic mice.16, 17 We suggest that SR\u2010A epitopes are similarly exposed on GA31 and GE31 in GA/E31\u2010HDL and on PA22 and PE22 in GF9\u2010HDL, providing similar uptake of these complexes and as a result delivery of TREM\u20101 inhibitory GF9 peptide sequences in vivo. The use of GA/E31\u2010HDL in the further development of effective and low\u2010toxicity therapy for ALD is advantageous because it makes the entire manufacturing process easier and less expensive.

(A, right panel) SR\u2010mediated endocytosis of HDL\u2010bound GF9 peptide inhibitors by Kupffer cells results in the release of GF9 (GA31 or GE31) into the cytoplasm; GF9 self\u2010penetrates the cell membrane and blocks intramembrane interactions between TREM\u20101 and DAP12, thereby preventing DAP12 phosphorylation and the downstream signaling cascade.
