            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and can be categorized into four major types: A, B, C, and D.1,2 Influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people cause seasonal flu epidemics each year. Influenza viruses inflict millions of infection cases in human and animals every year, and effective antivirals are an essential countermeasure against the disease. Amantadine is the first synthetic compound that inhibits influenza virus replication; the compound and its derivatives inhibit matrix-2 ion channels to block the migration of H+ ions into the interior of the virus particles, a process critical for virus uncoating to occur.3 In recent years, however, influenza virus resistance to these compounds has been widely reported.4,5 Another class of antiviral agent is neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, which include oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. These antiviral agents inhibit viral NA activity, which plays an important role in early influenza infection of the human airway epithelium and in virus budding.6 While oseltamivir is currently the most common commercial anti-influenza drug, resistance against NA inhibitors has been observed.5,7 On the contrary, several genome-wide screens have identified host factors essential for influenza virus replication.8\u201310 As an alternative to the aforementioned pathogen-targeted antivirals, growing efforts are devoted to blocking or promoting host factors to fight influenza viruses.11 By modulating host factors involved in viral replications, these host-targeted antiviral strategies may be less susceptible to strain variations and mutations as they do not exert a selective pressure on the target pathogen.",

            "text": "Among host factors that can be targeted for antiviral treatments, vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are a promising target for intercepting virus entry into host cells. V-ATPases are ubiquitous proton pumps located in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells.12 Among viral threats such as influenza viruses, flaviviruses, vaccinia viruses, bornaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and coronaviruses, V-ATPase-mediated endosomal acidification is an essential cellular process for viral entry.13\u201317 Inhibition of V-ATPase-mediated endosomal acidification may thus pave ways to new antiviral treatments with broad applicability and low susceptibility to drug-resistant mutation. Several V-ATPase inhibitors have been studied, among which plecomacrolide bafilomycin is the first discovered and perhaps the most notable example.18 While these compounds have shown antiviral potentials, their clinical application is thwarted by toxicity concerns.19\u201321 In addition, V-ATPase inhibitors are often poorly water soluble, which presents further drug delivery challenges. Previously, we showed that diphyllin, a new class of the V-ATPase inhibitor,12 is effective in blocking influenza virus infection,22 and its nanoformulation showed improved safety and effectiveness in inhibiting the feline coronavirus.23 Toward improving V-ATPase inhibitors for influenza treatment, we herein prepare diphyllin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles comprised of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) and examined its efficacy against influenza virus in vitro and in vivo. In parallel, we assessed the applicability of nanoparticle-mediated delivery to the commonly studied bafilomycin. The particular nanocarrier was chosen as PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticles that have been broadly adopted for enhancing the delivery of hydrophobic drugs.24 The biodegradable polymer is also widely used in FDA-approved products and is therefore readily translatable.25 The material has also been shown to induce little innate immune activation.26 In this study, the physicochemical properties and drug release kinetics of both diphyllin and bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles were examined. Cellular uptake of the nanoparticles was assessed in two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines, including MH-S and ARPE-19 (adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line-19). We further demonstrated that the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors were less cytotoxic than the free drug compounds and reduced influenza viral infection in vitro. Using diphyllin nanoparticles, we also showed that the host-targeted treatment can be applied to multiple strains of influenza viruses and successfully reduced disease severity in a mouse model of influenza virus infection, highlighting the potential of nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors for antiviral development.",

Mice were inoculated intranasally with a nonlethal dose of H1N1 virus and intravenously treated with diphyllin nanoparticles equivalent to 10 \u00b5g of diphyllin or empty nanoparticles of equivalent polymer content daily for 3 days (Figure 6A). The mice were subsequently monitored for weight loss and lung viral load. In the study, the control mice progressively lost weight for 9 days. In contrast, mice treated with diphyllin nanoparticles have reduced body weight loss (Figure 6B). The lungs of mice were harvested for viral RNA assessment on day 5 postinfection. Although statistical significance was not reached, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment alleviated the viral load in the lungs of mice (Figure 6C). We further evaluated the efficacy of diphyllin nanoparticles in a lethal infection of H1N1 virus (Figure 7A). Compared with the control group, mice receiving single treatment of diphyllin nanoparticles showed reduced weight loss (Figure 7B) and improved survival rate (33%, 2/6) upon termination of the study (Figure 7C). In contrast, all the empty nanoparticle-receiving mice succumbed to virus infection within 6 days postinfection. These in vivo data collectively suggest that the diphyllin nanoparticles are able to reduce disease severity and enhance the survival outcome, mirroring the anti-influenza activity we observed with in vitro investigations.",

To overcome these challenges, nanoparticulate drug delivery system offers several advantages in terms of improving drug delivery and reducing toxicity compared with the traditional forms of drugs. In our study, diphyllin and bafilomycin are hydrophobic compounds that possess cytotoxicity concerns. To improve the applicability of these compounds, we adopted a PEG-PLGA-based polymeric nanoparticle system, which readily encapsulates water-insoluble molecules in its hydrophobic polymeric core. The nanocarriers can then facilitate delivery of diphyllin and bafilomycin in the absence of organic solvents, steadying the drugs\u2019 pharmacokinetics through PEG-mediated long circulation and sustained drug release.30 Upon nanoparticle encapsulation, the water solubility of the drugs is improved and the cytotoxicity reduced. Moreover, diphyllin and bafilomycin showed a sustained release profile, which is advantageous toward improving the drugs\u2019 pharmacokinetics. In our previous report, we showed that diphyllin nanoparticles could enhance the compound\u2019s efficacy against the feline coronavirus,23 and this study further verified the nanocarriers\u2019 effect against influenza virus. Other studies have shown similar benefits upon nanoparticle encapsulation of antivirals. For instance, SaliPhe, a poorly soluble compound, has been encapsulated into porous silicon nanoparticles. SaliPhe-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles improved the compound\u2019s water solubility and reduced its side effect. However, the SaliPhe nanoparticles\u2019 in vivo efficacy remains to be studied.29 In another example, HIV-I integrase strand transfer inhibitor Dolutegravir was encapsulated into nanoparticles by a polymer p407. After nanoparticle encapsulation, this drug could better target macrophages and attenuate viral replication and spread of virus to CD4+ T cells.31 These results echo our present finding that nanoparticulate drug delivery system can be a useful tool for improving the delivery of V-ATPase inhibitors.",

            "text": "A major advantage behind antiviral approaches based on interference or promotion of host factors is that they can have broad-spectrum antiviral activities and are less susceptible to drug resistance mutations. As numerous cellular pathways are essential for viral replication, host-directed therapeutics have the potential to reduce viral replication and diminish harmful inflammatory responses.11,44 Several host-targeted antivirals are currently under investigation in late-phase clinical trials.45 In addition to V-ATPase, inhibitors of other host factors may be contemplated for improving the design of antiviral nanoparticles. Given the recent rise in immunomodulatory nanoparticle development,46,47 antiviral nanoparticles may also incorporate innate immune modulators to further enhance treatment potency. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. The use of diphyllin nanoparticle reduced the severity of influenza and improved the survival outcome in a mouse model of infection, and further investigation of its prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy is warranted. For future studies, drug dosing and administration route can be further optimized. As the nasal epithelium serves as the portal of entry for the influenza virus,2 a local intranasal administration of the antiviral nanoparticles may be considered. Moreover, an accumulated line of evidence shows that drug combinations significantly improve the anti-influenza efficacy for many existing treatments.48\u201350 We previously showed that combinations of diphyllin and oseltamivir or of diphyllin and amantadine demonstrated enhanced antiviral effect and cell protection.22 Several randomized controlled trials are set to test the safety and efficacy of various combinations of influenza antivirals.51 In a recent example, administration of protectin D1, a host-targeted therapeutic candidate, showed 100% protection against a lethal influenza viral challenge when combined with the peramivir, a pathogen-targeted antiviral drug, while treatment with protectin D1 or peramivir alone provided only partial protection (30%).52 In light of these successful combinatorial treatment, simultaneous delivery of multiple synergistic antiviral drugs by a single nanocarrier may be designed under the versatile nanotechnology platform. Furthermore, targeting specificity of host-directed therapeutics may be enhanced by surface modifications of drug-loaded nanoparticles.53 For instance, influenza virus targeting by nanoparticles was recently demonstrated with a cell membrane-coated nanoparticle.54 The strategy may be applied to further facilitate antiviral drug targeting. Future studies are warranted to further validate and improve the nanoparticle-based antiviral treatments.",

The nanoparticles achieved a sustained release beyond 72 hours and were efficiently taken up by multiple types of cell lines. In cell-based assays, nanoformulated diphyllin or bafilomycin revealed enhanced safety and viral inhibitory activities than free drugs. Moreover, diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles showed broad-spectrum activity against two subtypes of virus infections, H1N1 and H3N2. In selecting diphyllin for further in vivo studies, diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles were well tolerated in mice and reduced the weight loss and lung viral load after H1N1 influenza virus infection. The nanoparticles also improved mice survival following a lethal influenza viral challenge. Collectively, this work highlights nanoformulated V-ATPase inhibitors as potential host-targeted treatments against influenza. Continued development of the nanoformulations is warranted.",
