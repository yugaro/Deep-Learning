In 1988, a review by Couriel [21] emphasised the lack of high-quality studies to aid management. Nebulised adrenaline was advocated only in children with impending airway obstruction, due to the transient improvement and possibility of rebound. The benefit of steroids in the management was not clearly established at that time and hence most early studies compared treatments of nebulised adrenaline with placebo or racemic adrenaline versus\nl-adrenaline.",

Seven out of eight children who were treated with nebulised phenylephrine showed improvement clinically and in terms of airway resistance. One child who did not show improvement was later was diagnosed with acute epiglottitis. The authors reported that improvement was transient and the airway resistance returned to pre-treatment levels within 30 min, which was hypothesised as a possible rebound phenomenon.",

They posited that it is not likely that the phenomenon is related to adrenaline only, but rather to ongoing inflammation and oedema in the airway. They concluded that nebulised adrenaline is effective for the treatment of acute mild to moderately severe croup and that it should be used as a first line treatment [14]. This has not been taken up universally, but it is now standard practice in some countries to use steroids and nebulised adrenaline in the emergency department, watch the patients for 2 h and then discharge home if well enough [2]. The final two studies both used steroids and nebulised adrenaline, showing clearly a good response to the treatment with no rebound or indeed any major re-emergence of symptoms [12, 13].",
