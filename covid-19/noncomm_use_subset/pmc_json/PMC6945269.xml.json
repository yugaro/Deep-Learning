The currently-approved drugs for CHB, including the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), rarely achieve functional cure [3]. Dominant challenges in achieving CHB cure are presented by the stable presence of covalently closed circular DNA within host hepatocytes, and the immune tolerance primarily induced by the high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) load [4,5]. Thus, functional cure of CHB, characterized by loss of HBsAg and presence of HBsAb, is urgently needed.",

For instance, PEG-IFN and the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) combination increased HBeAg seroconversion and loss of HBsAg in some HBeAg+, HBV DNA low CHB patients [6]. In some patients who displayed a low-level of serum HBsAg under long-term antiviral drug treatment, HBsAg loss was observed after they received add-on PEG-IFN treatment [7]. At the same time, several monoclonal antibodies targeting HBsAg have been developed and are being evaluated at different pre-clinical or clinical stages [8], [9], [10]. These antibodies are capable of reducing serum HBsAg, and therefore may play a pivotal role in combination therapies for CHB functional cure.",

After eight weeks of HDI, the HBsAg positive mice were grouped according to their relative HBsAg levels and treated with a single dose of G12. Either an irrelevant human monoclonal antibody (m336) or HBIG was used as a control (Fig. 1a). A single dose of G12 reduced HBsAg to negligible levels in contrast to HBIG or m336 one day after the injection (Fig. 1b). The extremely low levels of serum HBsAg were maintained for more than 20 days, with a rebound after 24 days. The difference in HBsAg levels among the three groups had disappeared by 34 days. In contrast, a reduction in serum HBeAg by G12 did not occur during this monitoring period (Fig. 1c) and ALT fluctuation was not observed in these G12-treated mice (supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, G12-treated mice exhibited about one log10 lower serum HBV DNA levels than those that received control m336 or HBIG on day 20 post-infusion (Fig. 1d). HBIG did not show an inhibitory effect in this mouse model, possibly due to a lack of sufficient neutralization antibodies in the polyclonal immunoglobulins. Taken together, these results confirmed that G12 was able to potently decrease HBsAg levels in vivo.",

G12 concentrations decreased slowly in mice 4, 6, 7, faster in mice 2, 3 and the fastest in mice 1, 5 (Fig. 1e). Plasma HBsAb concentrations, calculated using a Roche Combas 6000, showed identical declining trends (supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, at day 24, the concentration of G12 decreased to a very low level in mouse 1(Fig. 1e). Accordingly, the rebound of HBsAg was only observed in mouse 1 at that time (Fig. 1f). At day 29, mice 1 and 5 that had the lowest levels of G12 displayed HBsAg rebound. Similarly, the four mice (mice 1, 2, 3, 5) that experienced HBsAg rebound at day 34 also had very low levels of G12 antibodies in serum. These results suggest that persistent HBsAg suppression is correlated with high HBsAb levels in vivo.",

Of note, mice 1 and 5, which displayed the fastest G12 clearance, also had much higher levels of MAHA, compared to other mice after 2 weeks of antibody infusion. These findings suggest that the in vivo clearance of G12 was partially due to MAHA, and that human antibody G12 may display longer half-lives if tested in humans.",

As expected, the G12 injection quickly reduced HBsAg to undetectable levels. However, the rebound time of HBsAg was shortened to ten days after the third G12 injection (data not shown), probably owing to the faster G12 clearance by MAHA. Interestingly, after prolonged follow-up, the mice that received three injections of G12 showed gradual clearance of HBsAg. Five out of six mice in the G12 group cleared HBsAg by four months after the first injection (Fig. 2b). By eight months after the first injection, HBsAg was cleared in all of the G12-treated mice, while more than half of the mice in the control and HBIG groups remained HBsAg positive (Fig. 2c). Three of six mice in the G12-treated group produced HBsAb, while only one mouse produced HBsAb in the HBIG group and no mouse produced HBsAb in the m336-treated group (Fig. 2d).

In contrast, liver sections from \u201csandwich\u201d-treated mice showed accumulated islands of infiltrating immune cell in the liver lobule area and a slight increase of immune cells in the liver sinusoids (Fig. 6a). These accumulated immune cells were typically comprised of dozens of MHC II+ myeloid cells aggregated with CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cell, whereas only a few MHC II bright and CD3+ or CD8+ T cells were found in the sections from mice treated with TDF-only (Fig. 6b and c). Also, compared with the controls, lymphocytes with increased granzyme B expression in cytosol were also found to be accumulated with CD11b+ myeloid cells that mainly account for the MHC II+ cells in the \u201csandwich\u201d-treated mice' liver, while only few CD11b+ and Granzyme B cells were found in the TDF-only mice\u2019 livers (Fig. 6d). Liver nonparenchymal cells were also isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry; significantly increased CD11b+ myeloid cells were found among CD45+ cells which excluded Ly6G+ neutrophils, (Fig. 6e and f), indicating the recruitment of antigen-presenting cells in loci. Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 production by recruited CD11b+ cells were also significantly upregulated in the \u201csandwich\u201d-treated mice (Fig. 6e and f). In addition, the CD8+ T cells showed decreased CD69 expression in the \u201csandwich\u201d-treated mice suggesting a high proliferation of these CD8+ T cells in vivo (Fig. 6g and h) [20]. Notwithstanding these immune responses in livers, no obvious elevation of ALT was observed in any groups of mice (data not shown).",

HBsAg, which can be present with as high as 1014 particles/mL in HBV carriers or patients, has been shown to inhibit host immune responses by multiple mechanisms including mediating T cell clonal depletion, exhaustion of HBV-specific T [23], [24], [25]. Thus, clearance of HBsAg is considered a crucial step for restoration of host immunity and achieving functional cure of CHB. Therefore, both rapid and efficient decrease in the load of HBsAg and induction of effective host immunity are the two arms in seeking functional cure. However, among all these strategies, there has not been studies on using active immunization based on transient clearance of HBV and HBsAg \u201cwindow stage\u201d.",

However, this strategy was only shown to increase HBsAg loss and seroconversion rate in a very small proportion of CHB patients whose serum HBsAg levels under 1500 mIU/mL [26,27]. A well-designed experimental study in mice found that multiple mouse HBsAb infusions followed with a combination of an HBsAg vaccine and a TLR9 agonist induced HBsAb and HBV-specific CTL responses in the AAV/HBV mice model [18]. However, the mouse antibody was infused with 3-day interval for more than 10 weeks, which needs to be modified to make it a feasible treatment for patients.",

HBsAg-HBsAb immune complex therapeutic vaccine has been established in our laboratory [28] and in phase IIB clinical trials, six injections per month followed for six months have been shown to result in HBeAg seroconversion rates of around 20% [29]. In addition, this vaccine was shown to decrease the percentage of regulatory T cells and to increase T helper cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells [19]. Here, adding a mouse version of this therapeutic vaccine to the \u201csandwich\u201d strategy efficiently induced both HBsAg-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. The existence of HBsAb-secreting plasma cells found in the bone marrow was consistent with the high level of HBsAb production and supported the conclusion that the \u201csandwich\u201d strategy indeed triggered effective humoral immune responses. Most importantly, histological studies showed that the \u201csandwich\u201d therapy evoked efficient immune responses in the liver with immune cells infiltrating in the carrier mice's livers. The presence of MHC II+ myeloid cells and T cells forming aggregates in the lobule area, together with upregulated granzyme B and TNF-\u03b1 production in the infiltrated CD11b+ cells was highly accordant with the significantly downregulated expression of HBsAg and HBcAg in the liver.

Although there were immune cells infiltrating in mouse livers in this study, we did not find obvious ALT elevation in the single G12 or \u201csandwich\u201d treated mice.
