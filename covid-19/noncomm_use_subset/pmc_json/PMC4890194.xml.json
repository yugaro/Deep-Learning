            "text": "In recent times, several life threatening viruses have emerged. They have been responsible for causing significant human mortality, in addition to raising serious public health concerns worldwide. Due to modern life, extensive travel of humans and goods, their outbreak anywhere in the world could potentially be a risk everywhere. Two novel viruses were implicated to be responsible for severe acute illness in recent times, i.e. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona-Virus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona-virus (SARS-CoV) (To et al., 2013, Meyer et al., 2015). These two viruses are causing acute and often fatal illness. Due to their high fatality rate (30\u201390%), they have had dual effect: fear among public from contracting one or more of them as well as high burden on the healthcare system, including the treating physician and other health care workers. The reservoir of the viruses is usually animal, including: bats, camels, or chimpanzees. Apart from animal to human transmission, human to human transmission has been reported, usually from an infected patient to a member of the health care team and to other patients in the hospital. Although no specific treatment has been recommended for their management so far; supportive treatment has shown to improve the outcome. Antiviral vaccines are under process. These novel viruses represent significant challenges to public health in general and to public health services and infection control in specific. Intensive education awareness and multi directional care does improve disease outcome. Therefore an accurate knowledge of their reservoir, their transmission, presenting symptoms approach to their investigation and best possible management together with preventive steps, is necessary. Close surveillance and vigilance remains a top priority to physicians and health authorities alike. In the present article we have reviewed the literature on several aspects like transmission, safety and efficacy of therapies used in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS infections.",

Convalescent plasma, lopinavir and interferon (IFN) are prescribed for better management of MERS-CoV infected persons. Interferon and lopinavir are likely to be the most accessible initial treatment. The effect of steroids on viral infection control in MERS is not well known, even though systemic corticosteroid usage delayed clearance of the related coronavirus, SARS CoV. MERS CoV has been linked with delayed replication of other respiratory infections. Subsequently, sequential sampling, diagnosis with PCR must be done in every patient who receives steroids for whichever symptom. Like exacerbations of asthma/COPD, doubted or identified renal problems or refractory septic shock are contraindications for such management scheme. Ribavirin and interferon combined therapy has some beneficial effects (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014). Cyclosporin A (CsA), cycloheximide, mycophenolate, IFN-\u03b2, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, anisomycin, and emetine dihydrochloride hydrate were identified to show the best protective effect from MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2013).",
