Women, especially postmenopausal women, are more susceptible to osteoporosis comparad to other groups. Bone mass and strength achieved at the end of the growth period is defined as peak bone mass (PBM), which is a significant determinant of osteoporosis (2,3). It is regarded that an increase of PBM by one standard deviation would reduce the fracture risk by 50% (4).",

Network-based systems biology approaches have emerged as powerful tools for analysis of molecular mechanisms of diseases (13\u201316). An integrated network method was applied to predict conserved regulators related to high and low viral pathogenicity, leading to therapeutic targets for intervention (17). In addition, recent study confirmed that signaling entropy computable from integrating a gene expression profile with a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN), correlate with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in disease compared to normal controls (18). Based on information theory, entropy opens new perspectives for gene inference methods and increases the accuracy of PPINs (19). Jin et al (20) compared the IAV-induced inflammatory regulatory networks and normal cellular networks by integrating the data from the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1 with PPINs, and these findings provide significant hypotheses for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases and developing control strategies.",

Based on the landscape, functional network entropy can be readily detected to facilitate the valuable application of PPIs on disease research. Previous studies have revealed that increased entropy appears to be a hallmark of cancer systems (27,28). Thus we utilized the previous hypothesis that the network entropy could discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network (20). The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can also discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. By applying a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of low and high PBM networks, we found the global network entropy of PBM networks is significantly differential (P<0.05). The result claimed that the network entropy provided good discrimination between low and high PBM networks. Moreover, this method can serve as a significant foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of other diseases and developing control strategies.",

In the present study, a total of 8 genes, PSMA2, PSMB1, PSMC1, PSMC4, PSMD5, PSMD7, PSMD8 and PSMD11, were identified in both monocyte low and high PBM networks. They belonged to precursors of macropain, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In a previous study, the surplus/PSMD5 was found to inhibit the assembly and activity of 26S proteasome in human disease (32). Importantly, neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II could regulate the expression of proteasome (33). Intracellular calcium mobilization regulates the activity of 26S proteasome during the metaphase-anaphase transition in meiotic cell cycle (34). At the same time, proteasome inhibitor lactacystin hinders the calcium homeostasis of dopamine neurons (35). Similar results were also obtained in this study, the results of RT-qPCR in this study showed that compared with sham controls, the expression of target genes in osteoporosis were obviously increased. In other words, the method of network entropy could be used to detect differential networks as indicator of disease. These 8 genes may play important roles in controlling inflammation of the osteoporosis. It suggested that the network is a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression. These findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.",
