Ferrets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with a ketamine-acepromazine-xylazine cocktail prior to all procedures. Prior to challenge, transponder chips (BioMedic Data Systems) were subcutaneously implanted for identification and temperature monitoring. Subjects were challenged intranasally with 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZEBOV strain Kikwit (n = 5), SEBOV strain Gulu (n = 5), and BEBOV (n = 5), respectively. The passage history of challenge viruses can be found in the Supplementary Methods. To account for variations between challenge events, 2 independent studies were completed, with the initial experiment having 3 animals, followed by a repeat confirmatory study with 2 additional ferrets per virus group. Whole-blood, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u2013associated plasma, and citrated plasma samples were collected from the superior vena cava for hematologic, serum biochemical, and coagulation assays and viremia determination on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 and at the time of euthanasia. Clinical signs, weights, and transponder-mediated temperatures were recorded daily up to the point of euthanasia. Clinical scores were determined on a scale of 0\u201312, based on coat appearance, social behavior, and provoked behavior. Animals scoring \u22659 were euthanized per the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol criteria.",

Striking increases of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling in the spleen was noted in all infected ferrets as compared to the control ferret spleens, suggesting increased lymphocyte apoptosis in these areas.

The mucosal route of infection has been implicated as an important means of Ebolavirus transmission and has also been demonstrated as an effective method of artificial infection by small-particle aerosol [9\u201311]. Accordingly, we challenged ferrets intranasally, a commonly used route in challenge experiments, to assess the mucosal route of infection prior to attempts using less natural routes of infection (eg, parenteral injection). The resulting uniform lethality demonstrates the utility of this intranasal infection model in potential mucosal-mediated transmission experiments or small-particle aerosol challenge, the latter being highly relevant for biodefense-related concerns. A remarkable point about the intranasal mode of infection is that, despite having direct access to the lungs upon infection, we observed minimal evidence of gross lung pathology; rather, the most impressive pathology and viral burdens were noted in the liver and spleen, just as in NHPs experimentally infected via the intramuscular route.",
