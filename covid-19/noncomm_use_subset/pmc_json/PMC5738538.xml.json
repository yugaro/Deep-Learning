Following general anaesthesia and intubation, hydrochloric acid (HCl, pH 1.25) was injected into the trachea, followed by stabilisation for 1 hour and mechanical ventilation for up to 4 hours (or until death). To increase variability of injury progression, animals received ranges of HCl doses (1\u20134 mL/kg), and were ventilated with one of several options (not randomised) of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, 3\u201310 cmH2O) and tidal volume (VT, 6\u201312 mL/kg). In a preliminary analysis, these strategies were aggregated for overall comparison into two groups with higher versus lower propensity to injury progression: one group ventilated non-protective settings and one receiving protective ventilation (table 2). Gas exchange, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), driving pressure,13 mechanical power of inspiration14 and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were monitored.",

We thereby co-localised baseline unstable inflation with subsequent injury progression.

In addition, our imaging approach in this design allowed investigation of the relationship among a spectrum of inflation abnormalities and subsequent development of injury.

There are multiple mechanisms that can explain why this is closely associated with disease progression. First, voxels with unstable inflation may reflect the presence of reversible atelectasis, possibly atelectrauma.22 Second, the high-risk regions contained voxels with intermediate gas content, mixed aeration that represents pathological alveolar inflation,23 airspace flooding by oedema24 and sparse microscopic atelectasis. Third, in areas where ventilated, collapsed and/or flooded airspaces coexist, CT yields an averaged greyscale7 and cannot resolve a \u2018single\u2019 inflation state. Moreover, alveolar interdependence results in focal augmentation of stretch,25 a concept supported by studies using in vivo MRI with inhaled hyperpolarised gas.23 Finally, flooding potentiates ventilator-induced injury26 and studies in humans7 and animals27 indicate that voxels with heterogeneous inflation are clustered among regions of fixed airspace filling and aerated lung. In summary, areas of unstable inflation concentrate local lung stress and potentiate topographic propagation of ventilator-induced injury.12\n",

Furthermore, ARDS is clinically under-recognised and undertreated31 and further refinement of conventional criteria (ie, plain radiography and oxygenation) is not likely to provide substantial improvement. However, the detection of high-risk tissue with unstable inflation using CT might, if validated, offer additional future options in properly screened patients.32 For example, image analysis could help identify subjects at high risk of deterioration, perhaps where unstable inflation is not reversible by ventilator adjustment. In such a setting, this information could inform treatment decisions, especially where costly or high-risk management (eg, extracorporeal therapy)33 is being considered. In addition, the information could be used to enrich clinical trials of interventions in ARDS, perhaps ensuring that only patients with a high (but not overwhelming) probability of poor outcome are recruited.2 34 In the future, measurement of high-risk tissue might enable determination of choices of (or responses to) specific therapies such as open lung ventilation, neuromuscular blockade35 or prone positioning.5\n",

The current results are preliminary, and translation is limited by interspecies anatomical differences.36 Furthermore, the human data are retrospective with a small sample size; thus, prospective human studies will be required to better calibrate the methodology for human microanatomy and to verify the prognostic value. Because our images were static, we likely underdetected viscoelastic and recruitment behaviours that affect dynamic inflation.37 The study design was intended to correlate baseline imaging characteristics with variable injury progression using an observational design similar to that used in our previous study.12 Rats received different ventilator settings without randomisation, because our aim was to induce variability in injury trajectory rather than to test treatment strategies. We could not separate the effects of baseline injury severity from those of ventilator management because both PEEP and VT each affect CT images, and these were not standardised during imaging. We chose this design because colocalisation with future injury requires that inflation is measured with ventilation settings identical to those being employed; future studies will address the predictive independence of high-risk inflation. The experimental model, acid aspiration, involves direct epithelial injury38 and intratracheal injection, which could explain the centrifugal injury propagation.12 The study is also limited by the short duration of the experiments and by the fact that injury progression was assessed through deterioration of imaging, Cdyn and oxygenation, but lung inflammation was not directly measured. However, histology confirmed disseminated injury in rats with severe radiological and functional worsening, in our previous rat study following a similar injury protocol.12 Furthermore, deterioration of lung compliance indicates the onset of ventilator-induced injury.39\n",

Misaligning the border between inflated and non-inflated regions can thereby introduce bias increasing the prominence of unstable inflation. However, our measurements of percent aeration distribution were virtually identical in warped and non-warped images (online supplementary table 1), and this suggests limited bias. Furthermore, the image warping technique seems adequate to maintain positions of major airway landmarks in animals and humans (online supplementary figures 3 and 6) and to generate realistic displacement maps (online supplementary figure 4); nonetheless, validation is required to further develop our methodology.",

Step 1: all EI and EE image pairs are superimposed on each other and aligned to the first EI image (time 0) following acid aspiration: EI(0). Then, the outline of the lungs is separated from surrounding non-pulmonary tissue. Because all images are superimposed, each individual voxel (see points A and B as an example) can be tracked in EI/EE image pairs and longitudinally over time. Step 2: plotting EI and EE densities against each other, each pair of EI/EE images generates one PRM: points in the PRM indicate the densities at EI and EE of the corresponding voxels, unmasking unstable inflation; the relative frequency of voxels in the PRM is displayed by the colour scale. Individual voxels A and B are now traceable in the consecutive PRMs: as the density of voxel B increases over time, its position in the PRM changes, while voxel A is more stable. Step 3: tracking all points of each PRM, we identified a high-risk density range (in red) where voxels had the highest probability of further increasing their density between consecutive PRMs, reaching a predefined severe injury range (blue area). Here, time 0 PRM is gridded, showing that point B(0) is located in the high-risk range, while A(0) is not. Step 4: the voxels in the high-risk and severe injury ranges of the PRM are now back-tracked to the corresponding baseline CT image. Step 5: a statistical model is created to predict the distribution of lung CT densities after 4 hours, starting from the density distributions at time 0.

The typical behaviour of normal voxels is clearly shown: they are clustered in a region where density is low (<\u2212700 HU) and stable with inflation. In contrast, lungs after HCl display a new region with unstable inflation, with relatively high expiratory density (\u2212100 to \u2212500 HU) and low-intermediate inspiratory density (\u2212500 to \u2212700 HU).

The corresponding EI and warped EE images are shown in the inserts for each PRM and show more severe propagation in the animal with non-protective ventilation versus more contained injury in the rat with protective ventilation settings. In the rat with more propagation (top), the distribution of paired EI and EE density values in the PRM evolved over time, with increased fraction of voxels in the high EI and EE density range (>\u2212300 HU), indicating oedema and/or non-reversible atelectasis (severe injury). In the rat with less propagation, voxel distributions were more stable over time. (B) Voxels that fell in the high-risk (yellow) and in the severe injury (red) domains of the PRMs were plotted in the corresponding EI images for each time point of the experiment in two rats, both ventilated with non-protective ventilation. Areas in green indicate voxels that fell in all remaining areas of the PRM. The inserts show the original baseline (after HCl) EI images.
