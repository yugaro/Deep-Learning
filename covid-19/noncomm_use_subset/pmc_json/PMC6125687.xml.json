Despite huge efforts and investment in research for the development of countermeasures and for understanding the viral life cycle, Ebola is still a priority disease for the WHO, due to the risk of re-emergence and lack of efficient vaccines or antivirals. The genus Ebolavirus is comprised of five species: Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus, EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus, SUDV), Tai Forest ebolavirus (Tai Forest virus, TAFV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bundibugyo virus, BDBV) and Reston ebolavirus (Reston virus, RESTV) (2,3). They belong to the Filoviridae family together with other filamentous viruses such as Marburg marburgvirus (Marburg virus, MARV), which also causes acute haemorrhagic fevers. Having a non-segmented negative strand RNA genome (NNS), the Filoviridae are part of the Mononegavirales order, which also contains the well-characterized non-pathogenic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as important human pathogens such as measles, Hendra and rabies viruses (4).",

Although it varies in length, sequence analysis revealed that L protein contains six conserved regions (CRI to CRVI, Figure 1A) (9). To date, the only available structure of a complete L protein from a mononegavirus is that of VSV. The structure, determined by cryo-electron microscopy, revealed a topological organization in five domains (10) to which distinct functions were attributed. These are, from N- to the C-terminus (Figure 1A): the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) closely associated with a capping domain (Cap) containing polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) activity, a structured connector domain (CD), the methyltransferase domain (MTase) and a small C-terminal domain (CTD). The enzymatic activities of the L protein are crucial for virus replication. Indeed, the RdRp domain drives genome replication and transcription into mRNAs (11), the PRNTase appends the cap structure onto the 5\u2032 end of the viral transcripts (12\u201318) and the MTase is involved in methylation of the cap (19\u201323).",

The cap is critical for virus replication as it protects viral mRNAs from cellular 5\u2032 exonucleases, allows the recruitment of the cellular eIF4e factor for translation initiation, and hides viral RNAs from detection by innate immunity sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 and interferon induced restriction factors such as IFIT molecules (for review, see (25)). The different enzymatic activities required for cap synthesis have already been characterized in mononegaviruses such as VSV (PRNTase and MTase activities) (17,22) and hMPV (MTase activity) (26). Strikingly, there is no biochemical or structural information on filovirus L proteins, likely because of difficulties in producing recombinant protein. Therefore, the capping process of filoviruses remained to be elucidated.",

We selected the construct spanning amino-acids 1713\u20132211 (Figure 1B), which produced soluble MTase+CTD protein. After optimization of the solubilisation buffer, the SUDV MTase+CTD was purified to homogeneity as previously described for hMPV (26) (Figure 1C). To characterize its MTase activity we first monitored the transfer by the SUDV MTase+CTD domain of radioactive methyl groups from the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyldonor to a variety of capped RNAs mimicking the conserved 5\u2032 end of SUDV transcripts. Some of these RNAs contained non-radioactive methyl groups at key positions (i.e. the N7-position of the cap or the 2\u2019O-positions of n1 or n2\u2014see Supplementary Table S1), to help identify the positions to which the radiolabelled methyl groups were transferred (Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, we observed a strong MTase activity on cap-0 (mGpppG), cap-1 (mGpppGm) and cap-2 (mGpppGmAm) RNAs. This activity was not observed with human RNA-N7 methyltransferase (RNMT) or the vaccinia virus 2\u2019O MTase (VP39), whose activities result in mG and n1m caps, respectively (Supplementary Figure S2A). The methylation profile is also different from that observed with the MTase+CTD domain of the closely related hMPV virus, which mainly targets the mRNA cap structure (Supplementary Figure S2B) and is weakly active on cap-1 RNA substrates. These observations thus suggest that the SUDV MTase+CTD methylates RNA at unconventional positions. To confirm the specificity of methylation observed, we mutated the conserved K-D-K-E catalytic residues typical for 2\u2019O methyltransferases. Supplementary Figure S1 and Figure 2B demonstrated that MTase activity is strongly decreased by alanine mutation of each 2\u2019O MTase catalytic residues. We then examined whether the presence of the cap was needed for this unconventional activity, and observed that both monophosphate and triphosphate RNAs could be methylated, although to a lower extent than the capped form, indicating cap-independent methylation in our experimental conditions (Figure 2C). This methylation does not seem to target the n1 as pppGmAU-SUDV9 is also methylated. These observations are further supported by similar dissociation constants measured for binding to pppG-SUDV12 and GpppG-SUDV12 (641 and 682 nM, respectively), suggesting SUDV MTase+CTD targets sites outside the cap (Figure 2D). Since the MTase activity depends on the 2\u2019O MTase catalytic tetrad (Figure 2B), we examined whether the methylation reaction targets 2\u2019OH groups of nucleotides within the RNA.",

Conversely, the MTase+CTD was unable to transfer methyl groups to the A27 RNA (HO-(Am)27) substrate, of which all adenosines were pre-methylated at their 2\u2019OH groups (Figure 3B). In addition, MTase activity is still detected using HO-(Am)A26 and HO-(AmAm)A25 RNAs as substrates. These results suggest that the SUDV MTase+CTD targets 2\u2019O positions of adenosines within the RNA substrates downstream of the cap structure. This internal adenosine MTase activity appears to be the main activity of SUDV MTase in our experimental conditions. Conversely, the ratio of MTase activities on cap-1 RNAs (mGpppXm-RNA) over those on capped but unmethylated RNAs (GpppX-RNA) indicates that hMPV, ZIKV and DV MTases predominantly methylate the cap-structure (Supplementary Figure S3A). Additionally, SUDV MTase+CTD also methylates double-stranded RNAs, contrary to ZIKV MTase that only targets adenosines of single-stranded RNAs (Supplementary Figure S3B) (29). Further tests showed that heteropolymeric cap-1 RNAs mimicking the conserved start sequence of SUDV 5\u2032 transcripts are good MTase substrates even if their inner G or U residues were previously methylated (Figure 3C). Conversely, prior 2\u2019O methylation of adenosine residues almost completely abolishes methyl transfer, confirming that there is no other unconventional activity on the cap structure. Methylation of internal residues does not decrease RNA/protein affinity as Kds for GpppG-SUDV12, mGpppGm(Am)-SUDV11, HO-(A)27 and HO-(Am)27 are similar (796, 881, 610 and 582 nM, respectively). To confirm that SUDV MTase is indeed a 2\u2019O MTase, we analysed by HPLC the resulting digestion mixture of HO-(A)27 RNA preliminarily methylated by SUDV MTase+CTD domain upon degradation with a 3\u2032-exonuclease and alkaline phosphatase (Figure 3E). After digestion, 98% of released residues correspond to native unmethylated adenosines and the remaining 2% were assigned to 2\u2019O-methyl adenosines (Supplementary Figure S4), which is consistent with the ratio of not transferred versus transferred tritiated methyl group during MTase assay (Supplementary Figure S5). These data confirm the identification of an internal adenosine-specific 2\u2019O methyltransferase activity (internal A-2\u2019O MTase).",

These RNAs mimicking the conserved start sequence of SUDV 5\u2032 transcripts and start with either an A or a G. Only the cap with a 2\u2019O-methylated G (GpppGm) at n1 was specifically methylated (Figure 4A), indicating that SUDV MTase+CTD has a cap N7 MTase activity, which is dependent on prior 2\u2019O methylation of the n1 guanosine. This N7 MTase activity is pH-dependent with an optimal pH ranging between 7.0 and 7.5 whereas 2\u2019O internal methylation peaks at a higher pH (Supplementary Figure S6). We further characterized the nature of the methylation of the cap structure by TLC analysis (Figure 4B). In this time course experiment, 2\u2019O-methylated RNAs with 32P-radiolabeled caps were incubated with SUDV MTase+CTD before RNA digestion by P1 nuclease. The release of a cap-1 (mGpppGm) structure could be evidenced by TLC separation (Figure 4B). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the MTase+CTD domain of SUDV has cap N7-MTase activity on RNAs starting with a G. Interestingly, we did not detect N7 methylation using cap 2\u2019O-methylated RNA beginning with an A (GpppAm), suggesting substrate specificity based on the first nucleotide of the RNA. While this methylation requires a 2\u2019O-methylated nucleotide at the first position of the RNA, cap 2\u2019O methylation could not be detected in our enzymatic assays performed with short RNA substrate (VP40-13 mers). We thus evaluated cap-dependent 2\u2019O MTase activity on synthetic RNA substrates of various lengths mimicking the 5\u2032end of VP40 mRNA (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The short RNAs (VP40-13-mers) could not be methylated (Figure 4C), confirming our previous results. However, longer RNAs (VP40-31-mers and longer (not shown)) became 2\u2019O-methylated on the n1 guanosine (Figure 4C), suggesting that RNA length or folding is a key factor for cap-dependent 2\u2019O methylations.",

Our results indicate that this cap methylation occurs only if the first RNA nucleotide is a 2\u2019O-methyl guanosine, like hMPV and VSV capping systems where the 2\u2019O methylation of the first nucleotide precedes the N7 methylation of the cap guanosine (22,26). Nevertheless, we did not detect any N7 methylation of capped RNAs starting with a 2\u2019O-methyl adenosine in our experimental system, suggesting substrate specificity based on the first nucleotide of the RNA. Since EBOV mRNAs start with an n1 guanosine (Dr Roland K. Hartmann, personal communication), this sequence specificity would ensure the specific methylation of SUDV mRNA. Contrary to what was observed with other viruses, such as coronaviruses (36,37) or flaviviruses (38\u201340), the 2\u2019O methylation of the n1 residue in SUDV is barely detected on short RNA and requires RNAs longer than 30 nucleotides. Interestingly, the addition of the cap in VSV requires RNAs that are at least 31 nucleotides long (18). These results prompt us to propose that transcription in the L protein starts off with the synthesis of a \u223c30 nt-long uncapped RNA, which remains covalently bound to the PRNTase domain before the non-methylated cap guanosine is added. The RNA cap is then methylated at the 2\u2019O position of n1 before N7 methyaltion of the cap guanosine by the MTase+CTD domain of L protein.",

We demonstrated that the SUDV MTase targets adenosines present within homo- and hetero-polymeric RNA sequences at the 2\u2019O position of the ribose. Unlike the n1 guanosine, internal guanosines are not methylated suggesting that substrate recognition is different for cap-dependent and cap-independent 2\u2019O methylations. Interestingly, the structure of the closely related hMPV MTase lacks a cap-binding site such as that present in flaviviruses, coronaviruses and vaccinia virus where the cap is stacked between aromatic residues (26,37,41,42). As SUDV MTase+CTD (like its hMPV counterpart) recognizes both cap and uncapped RNAs with a similar affinity and all SUDV MTase activities are carried out by a single catalytic site, our results suggest that the domain has evolved away from the requirement of a cap-binding site.",

            "text": "Different optimal pHs have been reported for N7 and 2\u2019O MTase activities (41). The SUDV N7 MTase activity appears more efficient at pH 7\u20137.5, which is consistent with the optimal pH described for other viral N7 MTases such as the ones of VSV, SeV or flaviviruses (22,29,42). On the other hand, the SUDV 2\u2019O MTase activity takes place within a broad pH range from 8 to 10 as previously described for VSV and flavivirus MTases (22,42). This difference suggests that N7 and 2\u2019O-MTase activities have a different chemical mechanism to transfer the methyl group from the SAM molecule to the RNA. This hypothesis has already been proposed for flaviviruses (42,43), which are structurally similar to both the N7 MTase of the protozoon Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Ecm1) and the vaccinia virus VP39 2\u2019O MTase (44,45). Yet, it has been shown that these two enzymes use two distinct mechanisms: N7 methylation in Ecm1 uses direct proximity and geometry of substrates (48) instead of a SN2 nucleophilic attack on the SAM following a 2\u2019OH deprotonation for the 2\u2019O methylation (46,47). Taken together, these results show that the overall MTase reaction mechanisms involving the K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad are conserved despite a putative absence of a cap-binding site, and that it is the manner at which RNA is presented to the active site, which determines whether cap or internal methylation takes place. The CTD domain of L protein may play a critical role in this process, as this basic domain is probably a key factor for recruitment and positioning the substrate RNA onto the active site of the MTase (47). It is thus possible that structural differences of CTDs among mononegaviruses may explain the different methylation activities observed.",

However, it has recently been shown that flavivirus MTases (Dengue virus and Zika virus) additionally carry out internal A-2\u2019O methylations (29,34). These activities might be related to the epitranscriptomic RNA modifications recently reported in the genome of flaviviruses (52). Here, we report for the first time that internal A-2\u2019O MTase activity also exists in viruses belonging to the Mononegavirales order (i.e. hMPV and SUDV) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3A). The level of internal adenosine methylation obtained with the MTase+CTD of SUDV is clearly much higher than those obtained with hMPV, Zika and Dengue viruses, which predominantly target the cap structure. This higher level may be due to the fact that SUDV MTase is able to methylate A-2\u2019O groups on both single- and double-stranded RNA structures, unlike ZIKV MTase, which carries out A-2\u2019O methylations on single-stranded RNA only (Supplementary Figure S3B). It is interesting to note that SUDV and hMPV MTase induces mainly internal A-2\u2019O methylation as recently described for ZIKV and dengue virus MTase. This observation suggests that residues in the RNA binding site specifically recognize adenosines residues. In the case of dengue virus MTase, the molecular basis of the specific adenosine recognition at n1 position was elucidated. The crystal structure of the dengue virus MTase in presence of its RNA substrate indicate that the n1 adenosine base fits in a pocket shaped by residues I147-G148-E149-S150 downstream of the D146 catalytic residue (53). The structure also reveals that G, in place of A residue would sterically clash with SAH and that pyrimidine (U or C) bases would decrease the van der Waals interactions with the protein explaining why the dengue virus MTase induces internal 2\u2032-O-methylations on polyA but not on polyG, polyC, or polyU substrates (34). Unfortunately, the residues downstream of the D catalytic residues are not conserved in SUDV MTase, and it is impossible to infer the residue involved in A1 recognition in the absence of structural data.",

Several studies recently reported the dynamics and complexity of viral epigenetic or epitranscriptomic RNA modifications during infection (52). Among them, internal A-2\u2019O methylations are one of the most abundant (\u22480.3%) although some of the viruses in the studies do not encode any MTase domain. It is noteworthy that, using SUDV MTase, we observed the same specificity of methylation on adenosine residues with \u223c0.5% of A-2\u2019O methylations. Additional work is now necessary to identify if host RNAs or viral RNAs are targeted by this viral MTase activity and to evaluate the importance of such RNA methylation in the context of innate immunity escape.",

Functional analysis using a flavivirus replicon showed that internal methylations attenuate viral RNA replication in BHK-21 cell lines (34). In addition, internal A-2\u2019O methylations may reduce the efficiency of polymerisation in an in vitro RNA elongation assay (34). On the other hand, it is also possible that epigenetic/epitranscriptomic RNA modifications increase viral replication by limiting the detection of viral RNAs by intracellular sensors and/or restriction factors. Indeed, methylations contribute to structural diversity of RNAs and thus regulate recognition by host proteins (54). One other possibility is that internal A-2\u2019O methylations would regulate encapsidation. In mononegaviruses, genomic and anti-genomic RNAs are encapsidated by a nucleoprotein (NP) but not mRNAs. Structural work (55) has shown that NP/RNA interactions involve 2\u2019OH groups on the nucleotides. Internal methylation of these groups may thus help NP to discriminate mRNAs from genomic and anti-genomic RNAs.",

            "text": "RNA methylation also plays a key role in disguising viral RNAs as host \u2018self\u2019 RNAs, allowing them to escape host surveillance by intracellular sensors regulating interferon expression. Among them, Toll-like receptors and RIG-like cytosolic receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 have been demonstrated to sense methylated RNA (56\u201359). Whereas RIG-I has been shown to detect 5\u2032ends of mis-capped RNAs, MDA5 may play a key role in the detection of double-stranded RNA without internal methylations. It is also possible that interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) or restriction factors could detect unmethylated RNAs as \u2018non-self\u2019, thereby limiting viral replication. Proteins from the IFIT family, for example, recognize the 5\u2032end of triphosphate or mis-capped RNAs and block their translation into proteins (60,61). Another example is ADAR, a deaminase known to suppress filovirus replication by RNA editing (62,63), whose activity is hampered by the presence of 2\u2032-OH methyl groups (64). A role of 2\u2019O-methylation in shielding the virus from the host's innate immunity system could also explain why replication of an EBOV minigenome is not inhibited by type I, type II or type III interferons (65), even in the absence of VP24, which helps repress ISG expression (66,67). Future research is needed to further characterize the internal methylation of Ebola virus RNA and to elucidate its role in the live cycle and pathogenesis of the virus.",

The third one, a cap-independent 2\u2019O-A methyltransferase activity, was not described before, and may further promote virus survival, possibly by shielding the RNAs from intracellular sensors and restriction factors thus promoting immune evasion, or by regulating RNA encapsidation by the nucleoprotein. These methylations might thus be important during Ebola virus infection. Although it remains to be elucidated why this activity is specifically prevalent in Ebola viruses, it has clear potential as a potent antiviral target.",
