Nowadays, Korea has become healthier than ever, and is now engaging in the role as a world leader in contribution of health and development.",

The National Archives of Korea, which serves as the principal repository for the official government records of Korea, including newspapers and broadcasting films, was visited for the research. The Diplomatic Archives of Korea, with the help of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was visited to seek the documents in regard to communication between the Korean government and the WHO, as well as its external consultants and other public health organizations. We visited the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) and its Library to access to the hard copies of historical documents from the WHO and Korea. It holds documents relating to health promotion and education, vaccination and the practice and management that were conducted in Korea since the 1950s. The materials span the 70 years of the relation between the WHO and Korea.",

Quarterly meetings hosted by the primary editor (Park NY) for reviewing were held during the development process. In 2015, a public hearing for the publication of the book was held with 10 currently active or inactive public health professionals from government, academia or health institutions. After the public hearing, the manuscripts, which were written in Korean, were translated into English by a professional English editing service. After translation, the English version of the draft was sent to the publication department of WPRO to be checked for consistency with the publication policy of the WHO.",

            "text": "The relation between WHO and the Republic of Korea was started by Korean officials' participating in the International Health Conference in 1946 as observers, and the Republic of Korea became a Member State of the Western Pacific Region on 17 August 1949. WHO and the Government of the Republic of Korea concluded a basic agreement for the roles and responsibilities for the development of health services in the Republic of Korea on 1 September 1951. During the 1950s, WHO provided the Government with support on policy and technical issues, as well as capacity-building necessary to establish the foundation for a national public health system. During the 1960s and 1970s, WHO played a critical role in the advancement of health care in the Republic of Korea by supporting to a wide range of health programmes covering acute communicable diseases, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria and parasites, maternal and child health, and environmental health. In 1962, WHO established a Country Liaison Office in Seoul and supported the training of public health workers through overseas fellowships and national training courses. During this period, the Republic of Korea began to contribute to global health including the activities of Korean experts in the WHO Secretariat and other developing countries, supplying dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) to Viet Nam, and establishing WHO collaborating center in Korea. Between 1980 and 1996, the Government of Republic of Korea gradually transformed itself from aid-recipient country to an emerging donor country. WHO also shifted its focus of support in the Republic of Korea from communicable diseases and maternal and child health programmes to emerging health issues such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer and environmental pollution. WHO focused on piloting the district health-care system based on primary health care, and building the capacity of public health officials with scholarships to graduate schools of public health in the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea also expanded its support to WHO in terms of financial contributions and technical expertise. Several Korean experts in the field of medicine and nursing were deployed as WHO advisors to other Member states such as American Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Brunei Darussalam, and Kiribati to support the development of primary health-care services. From 1997 to 2016, the Republic of Korea made a transition from recipient to donor, and the WHO Office in the Republic of Korea was finally closed in 2012. However, the Republic of Korea has established a stronger cooperative relationship with WHO, becoming a member of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and signing on to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. WHO also continued the support in the selected areas including measles elimination, the development of a new tuberculosis control policy, the control of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak and facilitating the Republic of Korea's support to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea's development allowed it to increase its financial contributions to WHO, establish the various WHO collaborating centers, and provide Korean experts to work with WHO. A growing number of WHO staff members from the Republic of Korea have worked at various levels of WHO including head-quarters, the Regional Office for the Western Pacific, and several WHO country offices (Cambodia, Fiji, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Samoa). Lessons learnt in cooperation between the Republic of Korea and WHO can guide other nations through the transition from an aid recipient to a country that can contribute to regional and global health initiatives.",
