Despite a lot of promises, it is difficult even in animal models to demonstrate, in a reproducible way, that any of the proposed murine PSCs can rebuild organs, contributing not only to fragments of parenchyma but also to vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Therefore, taking into consideration the huge interest and expectations of the public, we should pursue all possibilities and alternative approaches to finding such cells, combine our efforts without hostility and unnecessary competition and leave aside financial interests related to patents, company stock and funding by private investors or government agencies. If embryonic stem cells derived by therapeutic cloning in humans work and are safe, why not try them?1 Similarly, if induced PSC technology turns out to be effective and safe, why not try this technology in the clinic?2, 3, 4, 5 But why in this competition are there so many attempts to condemn stem cells isolated from adult tissues? In fact, because of their safety, stem cells isolated from adult tissues are the only ones that have so far been tested in clinical settings. However, we are aware and we have clearly stated several times that many of the positive effects of adult stem cell therapies are related to their paracrine effects,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 but at the same time, we cannot exclude other more direct mechanisms.6, 11, 12, 13",

In brief, the small nucleus of attacking scientists declared that VSELs, like other stem cells isolated from adult tissues, have no future in regenerative medicine, and in fact are artifacts. What is absolutely deplorable in our minds is the claim that clinical trials based on VSELs were a fake, or at least were not justified. We cannot help thinking that this was an attack on a grant allotted to investigators working on VSELs through a peer review system by the National Institute of Health and Department of Defense in the United States.",

In most of these reports, the stem cell that differentiated into cells from different germ layers has not been directly identified at the single-cell level. Thus, there was always the unanswered question: what stem cell is ultimately responsible for all these multitissue differentiation phenomena? We believe that many of us studying stem cells residing in adult tissues that display early-development markers and show broader differentiation potential are in fact looking at similar, overlapping populations of stem cells that can be quiescent44 but, if activated, are able to expand into different lineages. These cells reside at different levels of germ layer/tissue specification and can be detected if appropriate experimental tools are employed.",

            "text": "To summarize, the whole concept of the origin and existence of VSELs in adult tissues is based on the following theses:\nAdult tissues, including murine BM, harbor a population of very rare stem cells with multiple tissue differentiation potential, indicating that the hierarchy of the stem cell compartment in adult tissues and BM needs to be revisited.These dormant, early-development cells show several epiblast/germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin/deposition and relationship to early epiblast-derived migrating primordial germ cells (PGCs, Figure 1a). Epigenetic changes in imprinted genes, such as erasure of the maternal type of imprinting at differentially methylated regions, which are specific marks in PGCs to prevent them from undergoing teratoma formation,49, 50, 51, 52, 53 are also responsible for the quiescence of VSELs in adult tissues. As imprinted genes (for example, those encoded at the Igf2\u2013H19 locus) are involved in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), epigenetically regulated resistance of VSELs to IIS regulates their quiescent state.54\nHowever, although these cells can be activated and mobilized into peripheral blood during several known physiological emergencies,55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 they may also be involved in maintaining the pool of tissue-committed stem cells. The number of VSELs correlates with lifespan,61, 62, 63 and their potential role in tumorigenesis requires further attention.64, 65\n",

Murine VSELs, however, do not form teratomas and do not complete blastocyst development, which is a key feature of classical PSCs, such as embryonic stem cells or induced PSCs. However, this lack of pluripotentiality of murine VSELs should not be surprising, because early-development stem cells present in the adult body should be well protected from the risk of teratoma formation.",

In studies performed on highly purified double-sorted VSELs isolated under steady-state conditions from murine BM, we observed that these cells highly express, at the mRNA and/or protein levels, genes involved in both specification of the epiblast (for example, Stella, Prdm14, Fragilis, Blimp1, Nanos3 and Dnd1) and PGCs.68, 69 The PGC-specific genes, such as Dppa2, Dppa4 and Mvh, are characteristic of late-migratory PGCs. The expression of some of these crucial genes has been confirmed subsequently by demonstrating the presence of transcriptionally active promoters.68 Based on the molecular similarity between VSELs and PGCs, we presented the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms that keep VSELs quiescent in adult tissues is similar to the one that governs quiescence of PGCs and is based on epigenetic modification of paternally imprinted genes (Figure 1b).",

            "text": "Moreover, several recent reports based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting multiparameter sorting strategies were published that supported the existence of small, primitive VSELs and VSEL-like cells in adult tissues (the most important are listed in Table 1). For example, murine BM-sorted Sca-1+Lin\u2212CD45\u2212 VSELs have been shown to give rise to type 2 pneumocytes, which produce lung surfactant protein after transplantation into surfactant-deficient mice.17 Furthermore, small SSEA1+Lin\u2212CD45\u2212 cells that express Oct4+ sorted from rat BM gave rise in vivo to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in an experimental model of rodent acute myocardial infarction.47 Furthermore, Sca-1+Lin\u2212CD45\u2212 VSELs cells from murine BM16 or human mobilized peripheral blood18 cells expressing the SSEA4+CD133+CXCR4+Lin\u2212 and CD45\u2212 phenotype and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting formed murine and human bones, respectively, when embedded in gelatin sponges and implanted into immunodeficient mice. This bone-forming activity exceeded the activity of the other populations of BM-purified cells that were evaluated using the same assay. Based on this finding, it has been proposed that these BM- and mobilized peripheral blood-purified VSELs are at the top of the hierarchy for the mesenchymal and endothelial lineages.16, 18 Cells similar to BM-derived VSELs have been reported to reside in the ovarian surface epithelium in postmenopausal ovaries19, 48 and normal testes20 and were able to differentiate into gamete-like cells. As reported, these gonadal VSELs express nuclear OCT-4A, whereas the immediate descendants of these cells express cytoplasmic OCT-4B isoform.19, 20",

Eukaryotic cells incubated with SYTO dyes generally show cytoplasmic or mitochondrial staining, as well as nuclear staining'. This was confirmed in recent publication.99 As cell ploidy is defined by DNA content, clearly SYTO dyes cannot be used as ploidy markers, and the accuracy of the authors' ploidy estimation can be called into question. Despite this obvious mistake, based on the cell distribution shown in Figure 2C in the original paper by Miyanishi et al.,29 the authors conclude that \u2018VSEL candidates' consist of the large cells (>10 \u03bcm) with high Syto16-related signals (interpreted by the authors as normal, 2n cells, original Figure 1C29 and shown here as Figure 2a, blue box). On the contrary, we consider the fraction of smaller cells (FCSlow) appearing as Sytox16dim cells (originally Figure 1C29 and shown as Figure 2a in this article, red box) to represent potential VSELs because of their well-known low cytoplasmic content and greater resistance to DNA staining, which has been characteristic of these cells in our experience as well as that of other groups.17, 19, 96, 100 Unfortunately, as Miyanishi et al.29 decided to sort the Syto16bri cells (which most likely belong to the CD45int subpopulation of progenitors or erythroblasts in the analyzed material) as \u2018VSEL candidates', we are not surprised that they were unsuccessful in isolating VSELs in subsequent steps. Because of this crucial mistake and their resultant focus on the wrong population, the authors' statement \u2018This indicated that our VSEL candidates were the relatively larger cells in the population analyzed, unlike the VSELs described in previous reports (Kucia et al., 2006; Ratajczak et al.45; Wojakowski et al.55; Zuba-Surma et al.29,94, 95, 96) is not supported by any evidence.",

Importantly, as mentioned above, Danova-Alt et al.27 focused on the subset of CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CXCR4+ UCB cells that we indicated as being least enriched in VSELs. Based on our data collected within the past few years, we clearly suggested that primitive Oct-4+, SSEA-4+ cells should be sought within the much rarer fraction of CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CD133+ cells.46, 97 Unfortunately, Danova-Alt et al.27 disregarded our recently published results and followed an incorrect population that we initially isolated 5 years ago and then further studied.15, 46, 97 Interestingly, although these authors concluded that CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212 cells from UCB essentially lack CD34 and CD133 antigens, these cells are visible even in their histograms (originally Figure 2B27 and shown as Figure 2b in this article, upper panel), but the authors inexplicably overlooked the rare objects, including the VSEL fraction,27 which we clearly indicated in our analysis done on dot plots (Figure 2b, lower panel). It is clearly apparent that both CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CD34+ and CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CD133+ cells are present in at least some UCB samples analyzed by Danova-Alt et al.,27 which are indicated in their original histograms by blue boxes marking rare objects corresponding to both populations (Figure 2b, UCB samples 1, 2 and 3). Another important technical problem is that the authors instead of using for CD133 staining as we recommended in our original protocols antibodies against CD133/1 epitope100 employed not optimized for VSEL isolation an anti-CD133/2 eiptope antibody (clone: 293C3).",

            "text": "Similarly, in the third of the \u2018con' papers, Szade et al.28 went a step further and tried to set up an entirely new protocol for isolation of murine VSELs, discounting our already published strategies, and eventually sorted a fraction distinctly different from very small CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ cells, thus presumably losing the VSELs during isolation. Using their de novo protocol, these authors28 made several cardinal mistakes, including: (1) setting up an enlarged input gate on the forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) plot that, on one hand, included granulocytes and apoptotic cells, resulting in enrichment of sorted fractions with artifacts reflected in further analyses (for example, Annexin V binding) and, on the other hand, excluded some of the critical very small objects from further sorting (originally Figure 1A28 and shown as Figure 2c in this article); (2) losing very small objects further by cutting them out during gating for \u2018singlets' (originally Figure 1A28 and shown as Figure 2c in this article); (3) focusing on selection markers that were not proven to be expressed on VSELs (for example, c-kit); and (4) a selective focus on some populations and discarding other fractions (containing potentially VSELs) based on a superficial interpretation of results such as Annexin V binding.28 For instance, the entire fraction of CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/c-kit\u2212/KDR\u2212 was excluded by the authors from further sorting because it was deemed \u2018apoptotic' (Figure 228), although it most likely contained not only real Annexin V+/FSClow/SSCdim/hi apoptotic objects, but also VSELs. Importantly, we have found that healthy normal cells (including VSELs and HSCs) may bind Annexin V following lysis of red blood cells because of microvesicle/microparticle release and posphatydylserine transfer to the membranes of the normal cells.101 Thus, not all Annexin V+ objects should be interpreted as \u2018apoptotic', as these may sometimes represent normal, functional cells.101",

Answers to these and several other questions are crucial for the academic community to understand the discrepancies in proper VSEL identification and sorting encountered by Miyanishi et al.29 as well as other groups struggling with VSEL isolation.27, 28 We plan to highlight these methodological aspects in more detail in a separate paper focusing exclusively on flow cytometric pitfalls and techniques in rare stem cell characterization, including for VSELs.",

They, for instance, compared the BM cell distribution with bead standards on different sorting machines (both Aria (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and MoFlo (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA)) and pointed to visible discrepancies. We understand that this approach was related to our sorting protocols suggesting standard-sized beads for gate set-up. However, when it was already clear from their initial experiments (shown in the first and second dot plots in the original Figure 1)29 that the cell-size measurement based on the beads employed was not accurate on the particular Aria instrument used for experiments (as all murine white blood cell populations appeared erroneously to be >10 \u03bcm), the authors continued the size comparison, which was in fact irrelevant to the final sorting outcome. On the other hand, the authors should re-evaluate gating on the instrument they used and VSELs should be sought in the fraction of objects between 4 and 6 \u03bcm or even between 4 and 8 \u03bcm rather than 4 \u03bcm, as all objects are shifted to the upper FSC values when compared with beads (original Figure 1)29.",

Apoptotic cell and erythrocyte contamination was reported in the paper by Szade et al.,28 the group that significantly modified sorting and eventually isolated a murine BM cell population distinctly different from VSELs. Moreover, the gating for sorting was performed in an untidy fashion, and very small cells were lost at different steps28 (Figure 2c). Thus, any major change in gate set-up that results in VSELs being unnecessarily mixed with other objects should be carefully avoided.Use dot plots to visualize populations. We generally do not recommend using histograms for any identification and sorting of rare fractions of stem cells, including VSELs. Although in our initial sorting protocols we used histograms visualizing, for example, CD45 expression for final separation of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells,14, 96 we gradually became aware that replacing such a histogram with dot plots (for example, CD45 vs SSC) was much more informative and gave a better gating set-up (Figure 3). Moreover, we found that rare cells such as human VSELs have been simply overlooked by other investigators using histograms showing expression of CD133 and CD34 in CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212 human UCB samples,27 although these very rare SCs would be clearly visible in the same samples and in the same analyses if, for instance, CD133 (or CD34) vs SSC dot plots are employed97 (Figure 2b).Importantly, we also exclude any contour plots from our sorting and analysis protocols, which were used by Miyanishi et al.,29 as in our opinion they flatten the view and do not provide complete information about low cell number clusters and the single-cell distribution when we focus on isolation of unique rare objects. We believe that employing contour plots may also potentially lead to technical problems in sorting of rare SCs, as the clear borders of subpopulations are not easily visible.Eventually, when gated properly, CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ cells will \u2018come back' as a homogeneous population of small objects in a FSC vs SSC dot plot following back gating (Figure 3).",

Indeed, the authors should be aware that all of our previous analyses (which they questioned in their paper29) were performed with a much more powerful, sophisticated and higher-magnification ImageStream (Amnis Corporation) system.94, 96, 97, 104 Based on our observations, although FlowSight is capable of analyzing a majority of large cells with its single \u00d7 20 objective and fixed optical configuration,105 it cannot provide images of VSELs of the quality required for reliable image processing, accurate masking and feature calculations by Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS). We have already performed such analyses in our laboratory with a FlowSight demo instrument, and we could not obtain reliable IDEAS data based on FlowSight acquisition, even for human VSELs, which are much larger cells than their murine counterparts (E Zuba-Surma, unpublished data). Therefore, and importantly, the majority of small murine VSELs would not be easily visible on a FlowSight instrument because of its limitations in object resolution. This is also reflected by images in the paper by Miyanishi et al.29 (original Figure S1C29 and shown as Figure 2d in this article, left panel). FlowSight, with its standard optics pixel resolution of 2 \u03bcm, which may be increased maximally to 1 \u03bcm/ pixel with the Quantitative Imaging Upgrade, still lacks sufficient resolution for accurate VSEL size measurements.105 Based on our extensive experience in VSEL size evaluation and imaging cytometry, the following facts have become apparent: (1) the only current imaging cytometer that is optically capable of visualizing VSELs is the ImageStream system (both ImageStream 100 and ImageStream X systems, which were used in our VSEL studies), (2) the quality of images of analyzed objects undermines the accuracy of size measurements by IDEAS software for such small objects as VSELs, which is related, for example, to accurate masking set-up by the software, (3) the masking performed by IDEAS should always be verified by the investigator and often fine-tuned (for example, decreased), as the contribution of the cellular halo is much more prominent for small objects than for larger cells, significantly affecting the size calculation when masking automatically based on the brightfield image.94, 95, 96, 97, 100, 104",

Furthermore, the population they focused on as VSELs (CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/c-kit+) was not comparable to our reported cells. On the other hand, the authors carelessly excluded potentially crucial objects (4-5 \u03bcm in size based on their unknown masking and diameter measurements) from size analysis in the CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/c-kit\u2212 fraction, which could contain VSELs (Figure S2 in Szade et al.28 and Figure 2d in this article, middle panel).

Moreover, it was the first paper that clearly showed that the fraction of FSClow/SSClow/CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ cells sorted by classical flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) may not only contain a great amount of debris and artifacts, but also include small cellular objects such as VSELs.96 We further showed a similar phenomenon, with even more debris because of enzymatic digestion, for isolation of VSELs from solid tissues.95 It is noteworthy that all of our previous VSEL size measurements were performed with a \u00d7 40 objective and a resolution of 0.5 \u03bcm per pixel (on ImageStream 100 and ImageStream X systems, Figure 2d, right panel).",

Is it really essential that a PSC should show these properties? There should be scientific deliberation on this\u2014in fact this inability to form teratoma may prove to be a very positive feature; such cells might be destined for regenerative medicine. On the other hand, we have always emphasized that, in contrast to their murine counterparts, much work still needs to be done to better characterize human VSELs.

            "text": "Figure 1: The overall concept of a presence of developmental early epiblast/germline-derived stem cells in adult tissues. (a) Retention of germline potential during ontogenesis. Cells with germline potential are shown in blue. The earliest and the most primitive cell in the germline is the totipotent zygote. The germline potential is subsequently retained during development in Oct-4+ cells located in the inner cell mass cells (ICMs) of the developing blastocyst, epiblast stem cells (EPSCs), primordial germ cells (PGCs) and gonocytes in gonads. Epiblast/germline potential could also be retained in rare early-development small VSELs deposited during development in peripheral tissues as founders for more differentiated monopotent tissue-committed stem cells. Some of these small cells express Oct-4 (shown in blue). (b) The cycle of life\u2014from zygote to germ cells. From a developmental and evolutionary point of view, the germline (shown by red arrows) carries the genome (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA) from one generation to the next, and all somatic cell lines bud out during ontogenesis from the germline to help germline cells accomplish this mission effectively. The germline potential is established in the fertilized oocyte (zygote) and subsequently retained in the morula, inner cell mass of the blastocyst (ICM), EPSC, PGCs and mature germline cells (oocytes and sperm). The first cells that bud out from the germ lineage are trophoectodermal cells, which give rise to the placenta. Subsequently, during gastrulation, EPSCs are a source of PSCs for all three germ layers (meso-, ecto- and endo-derm) and PGCs. We hypothesize that at this stage some EPSCs and PGCs are deposited as Oct-4+ VSELs in tissues developing from meso-, ecto- and endo-derm (blue circles). Blue box and yellow arrows pointing at VSELs indicate mechanism based on epigenetic modification of parentally imprinted genes (for example, at Igf2\u2013H19 and KCNQ1p57Kip2 loci) that keeps these early-development cells quiescent in adult tissues. A similar mechanism based on erasure of imprinting also regulates the quiescent state of PGCs.",

            "text": "Figure 2: Flow cytometric concerns regarding VSEL identification and isolation. (a) Miyanishi et al.29 described and subsequently isolated large-size, Syto16-bright, CD45\u2212/int/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ murine cells as \u2018VSEL candidates' (lower left plot, blue box), whereas in our opinion, a visible population of smaller, Syto16-dim cells is the most likely VSEL population (lower left plot, red box). Syto16 is not an optimal DNA dye, and its staining also depends on other intracellular components. It is, for instance, visible in the CD45hi/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ population (lower right plot, green box), which is almost a half log unit brighter than the majority of FSChi cells (lower right plot, black box). Moreover, we have a general concern about Sytox-Blue and Sytox16 staining in this study because unfractionated BM cells do not contain any debris or dead cells in such a sample (upper right plot, magenta box), which are visible within subfractions of these cells. (Dot plots were adopted from a paper by Miyanishi et al. (Stem Cell Reports; 2013, 1, 1\u201311; part of\nFigure 1C)\u2014published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivative Works License).29 (b) Danova-Alt et al.,27 in their recent studies focusing on human VSEL isolation, concluded that CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CD133+ cells (which we consider in fact to be a population enriched in human VSELs) as well as CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/CD34+ cells do not exist in CB, whereas such cells are not only found in our samples (lower dot plots, VSELs marked with blue circles), but also in some CB samples (1, 2 and 3) analyzed by Danova-Alt et al. (upper histograms, VSELs marked with blue boxes).27 These rare stem cell populations were overlooked by Danova-Alt et al.27 because of their visualization on histograms, but are clearly visible when dot plots are used for analysis.97 (Histograms were adopted from the paper by Danova-Alt et al. (PLOS One; 2012, 7, e34899; part of\nFigure 2B)\u2014published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution License).27 (c) Szade et al.28in their recent studies on VSELs tried to set up a new protocol for murine VSEL isolation. They were unsuccessful, as they focused on an incorrect fraction and, importantly, lost VSELs during an incorrect gating process.28 A fraction of the very small objects was lost during: (1) gating on the FSC vs SSC plot (left plot, original gate is shown in black, whereas the suggested classical gate for VSELs is shown by a red circle) and (2) excluding doublets (right-hand plots, original gates are shown in black, whereas suggested gates are shown as red boxes, and arrows indicate areas where VSELs were most likely excluded from sorting gates).

(PLOS One; 2013, 8, e63329; part of\nFigure 1A) published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution License).28 (d) Images of selected murine cell populations used for size calculation by imaging cytometry. The left panel shows FlowSight-derived brightfield images of CD45\u2212/int/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/Sytox16+ objects that were isolated as \u2018VSEL candidates' by Miyanishi et al..29 Despite the fact that these cells do not represent the VSEL population described by the Ratajczak group, the quality of images is too poor for accurate quantitative analyses, including size calculations.29 Importantly, images were collected on the instrument with a low sensitivity that may not be useful for VSEL characterization (scale indicates 20 \u03bcm). (Images were adopted from the paper by Miyanishi et al. (Stem Cell Reports; 2013, 1, 1\u201311; part of Figure S1C)\u2014published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivative Works License).29 The middle panel represents size analysis performed by Szade et al.28 using the ImageStream X system. The histogram shows size analysis of CD45\u2212Lin\u2212Sca-1+c-Kit\u2212 cells, where objects 4-5 \u03bcm in size are unfortunately excluded from analysis (as indicated by the orange box), whereas the images are confusingly derived from the distinct CD45\u2212Lin\u2212Sca-1+c-Kit+ cell fraction, which does not represent VSELs. Importantly, the quality of images is too poor for accurate data analysis. (Data were adopted from the paper by Szade et al. (PLOS One; 2013, 8, e63329; part of Figure S2)\u2014published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution License).28 The right panel shows representative images of murine VSELs (CD45\u2212/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/7-AAD+ cells), HSCs (CD45+/Lin\u2212/Sca-1+/7-AAD+ cells) and platelets (CD41+/7-AAD\u2212 objects) obtained with the ImageStream 100 system and used for VSEL size analysis.96 Importantly, with an optimized instrument and good-quality images, even objects as small as 2-\u03bcm platelets may be visible and quantified by IDEAS software. Cyan areas show masking used for calculations of cell size by Zuba-Surma et al.96",

Agranular, small events ranging from 2 to 10 \u03bcm (as initially set up with Flow Cytometry Size beads, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) are included in an \u2018extended lymphgate' on an FSC vs SSC dot plot (region R1; a). The population of cells from region R1 may be additionally depleted of doublets (gate R2; b) to enhance sorting purity (b). The single-cell fraction from gate R2 is further analyzed for Sca-1 and Lin expression and exclusively Lin\u2212/Sca-1+ cells are gated (R3) to avoid erythroblast contamination (c). The population from region R3 is subsequently separated into CD45\u2212 and CD45+ subpopulations visualized in regions R4 and R5, respectively, on a CD45 vs SSC dot plot (d). CD45-dim objects are preferentially included in the CD45+ population (region R5). If BM cells are gated strictly according to these steps (with special caution for R1, R3, R4 and R5 gate set-up), the populations of VSELs and HSCs derived from regions R4 and R5, respectively, separate cleanly when \u2018back-gated' on FSC vs SSC dot plots (e). Both stem cell fractions may be additionally purified by final gating, including size-related regions R6 and R7 for VSEL and HSC sorting, respectively.
