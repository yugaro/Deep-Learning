However, traditional surveillance systems mainly depend on case reports, such as influenza-like illness (ILI) reports, which have time-delays in reporting and case confirmation. To enable the earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks, a syndromic surveillance system should utilize real-time or near-real-time data, i.e., school or work absenteeism, over the counter medication sales, or the volume of Internetbased health inquiries [4567]. Among diverse alternative data sources, search queries, social media, and website visits have proven potential for digital surveillance systems [3578910]. In Korea, there is a national health alert system operated by the National Health Insurance Service which uses data from social media and blogs [11].",

In our previous works regarding influenza prediction, we conducted a survey by quota sampling based on sex and age to choose keywords [89].

The newly renovated Naver DataLab only offers weekly trends, and it requires several steps to download the output. Therefore, we only explain how to use Google Trends. Google Trends offers various data patterns starting from the previous minute's data to monthly data based on the selected time range. For example, Figure 2 shows the weekly trend of searches for \u201cinfluenza\u201d of Google Trends between September 9, 2007, and September 8, 2012. Trend data associated with the predefined keywords were retrieved by setting the location parameter to \u201cSouth Korea\u201d and setting the time parameters. The time parameters were based on previous disease outbreak seasons, for example, \u201cMay 2015 to Jun 2015\u201d for MERS in Korea. May 11, 2015 was the symptom onset day of the first laboratory-confirmed patient. The results can be downloaded in a CSV format by clicking the arrow located in upper right in the graph. The downloaded CSV file consists of two columns. The first column represents the week by indicating the starting date of the week and the second column is the trend data. The researcher should collect the necessary trend data for each keyword. Table 2 shows example influenza statistics from ILI reports (Figure 1) with Google Trends data for the following five keywords: \u201cNew influenza,\u201d \u201cNew flu,\u201d \u201cFever,\u201d \u201cTamiflu,\u201d and \u201cFlu\u201d (Figure 2).

Lag correlation analyses can be used to assess the temporal relationships between these sets of data for up to userdefined days or weeks. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In our work, we used the SPSS package to obtain statistical values, and the proposed method is summarized as follows. The KCDC data values are placed tidily in a column (Table 2). The search engine query data values to be compare are placed next to it. The data must be arranged in rows so that each row represents a specific time period. The correlation value obtained in this state means present (0 week lag) [8]. To get the correlation coefficient of preceding or lagging week, the column containing a search engine query data value is moved in the desired direction and correlation analysis is performed. In this case, the data that differ by the number of weeks to be compare is placed in the same row.",

First, in our work, it was difficult to choose keywords although they have a considerable effect on the performance of a prediction model. More importantly, keywords should be changed periodically. For example, before 2015 only experts were aware of MERS. However, most Koreans know about MERS nowadays. Since people continuously learn new terminology and change the search keywords they use, keywords should be updated regularly to maintain prediction performance [9]. Second, as in the case of Google Flu, this system can fail to predict disease outbreaks correctly [20]. Therefore, the proposed digital surveillance system should be used with caution or as a complementary method.",
