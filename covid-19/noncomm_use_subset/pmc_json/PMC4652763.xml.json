Because ssRNA replicates by a simpler mechanism than DNA, it is used as the genome in primitive life-forms that evolved in the RNA world or the later RNA-protein world (1,2), and is also proposed to be useful as the basis of a genome for an artificial cell (3).",

This dsRNA formation is a problem for recursive replication in the RNA world (3) and is one of the most serious problems in the reconstitution of a replication system of an artificial ssRNA genome (4,5).",

The molecular mechanism of the replication has been intensively studied recently (7\u20139). This replicase requires CCC at the 3\u0384-teminus (10), stem structures at the 5\u0384-terminus (11), an internal C/U-rich domain (12) and a long-range interaction between 5\u0384- and 3\u0384-termini (13) for efficient replication. However, even if all of these requirements are satisfied, RNA-encoding genes that originate from organisms other than bacteriophage Q\u03b2 mainly produce dsRNA and then terminate replication (14\u201321). Although some factors, such as components in a cell-free translation system and ribosomal protein S1, are known to inhibit dsRNA formation (22\u201324), they were insufficient to render ssRNA-encoding arbitrary genes replicable without dsRNA formation (22). In addition, rigid secondary structures of a template RNA have been reported to inhibit dsRNA formation (25,26). Because quantitative requirements for the structures (i.e. the size or stability of structures) have not been determined, it is not possible to design an ssRNA that encodes an arbitrary gene at this time.",

For viral genome analysis, we obtained all viral genome sequences registered in the NCBI database on 8 January 2015 (the list of accession numbers is provided in the Supplemental text), and the centroid secondary structures were predicted using the RNAfold algorithm in the 2.1.8 Vienna RNA package (32,33). We applied this analysis to sequences of all types of genomes (ssRNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, dsDNA and retrovirus genomes). Based on the secondary structural predictions, we counted the average loop size and average GC number in loops. For genomes larger than 4500 nt, we separated the sequences to a set of fragments less than 4500 nt, and after secondary structure prediction of the fragments, the GC numbers in loops of all of the separated fragments were averaged. Extremely large genomes (>40 000 nt) of some bacterial dsDNA viruses were removed before analysis to reduce the calculation load. The numbers of virus genomes in each category are shown in Supplementary Table S3.",

To examine this prediction, we performed replication experiments using RNAs with insert sequences that consist of only U and A (6. Loop UA5, 7. Loop UA10, 8. LoopUA15 and 9. Loop UA20) and compared to the results with the loops that consist of half G and half A described above.

To further investigate the effect of the GC ratio, we compared the dsRNA ratios of the RNAs with 10-nt loops inserted with various nucleotide compositions, such as all G (10. Loop G10), all A (11. Loop A10), all U (12. Loop U10), G and A (4. Loop GA10) and U and A (7. Loop UA10). The dsRNA ratio exhibited larger values for two RNAs (Loop G10 and GA10) that had higher GC ratios (100% and 50%, respectively, Figure 3F).

To examine the usefulness of this rule, we attempted to design an ssRNA that is continuously replicable as a single strand and that encodes an active gene by following this rule. As a criterion of \u2018continuously replicable as a single strand,\u2019 we employed the condition of \u2018less than 0.5 dsRNA ratio,\u2019 because if the dsRNA ratio becomes >0.5, the ssRNA only decreases as replication proceeds. As a target gene, we used the \u03b1-domain of \u03b2-galactosidase of Escherichia coli. The activity of this small gene (\u223c300 nt) is monitored by \u03b1 complementation in the presence of the omega-domain of \u03b2-galactosidase (31,37). We introduced the \u03b1-domain into the same site of MDV-1 as with the RNAs in Figure 2 to obtain mdv-\u03b1 RNA (original mdv-\u03b1). Secondary structure prediction of this RNA revealed the existence of many large loops (Figure 7A, original mdv-\u03b1). We performed the replication experiment with this RNA and found that almost all synthesized RNA was dsRNA (Figure 7B, original).",

The predicted secondary structure of m1 exhibited reductions in size and the number of loops compared to the original (Figure 7A, m1). The replication experiment with m1 indicated that the synthesis of ssRNA increased significantly, but the dsRNA ratio was still greater than 0.5 (Figure 7B, m1), likely because the mutant m1 still had six remaining loops that contained three or four GCs (Loops 1\u20136 of m1, Figure 7A). Further reduction of the GC number by introducing synonymous mutations would be difficult in most of these loops because it would require massive reconstruction around the loop regions. Therefore, we first attempted to identify target loops that must be improved and then to reconstitute the structures around the loops. To identify the target loops, we deleted the remaining Loops 1\u20136 with various combinations to obtain the mutants m2\u2013m12 and measured the dsRNA ratios of the replication products (Table 1). The dsRNA ratios of these deletion mutants were all lower than that of m1. Among the deletion mutants, m3, which lost Loops 1\u20135, showed the lowest dsRNA ratio (0.34), and m11, which lost three loops (Loops 1, 2 and 4), lost the fewest loops, yet exhibited a dsRNA ratio of <0.5. We then attempted to modify the Loops 1, 2 and 4 regions to reduce the GC number by introducing synonymous mutations instead of deletions. For Loops 2 and 4, we reconstructed structures around the loops by introducing 10 synonymous mutations to decrease the GC number in the loops to <3. For Loop 1, which locates in the 5\u0384-untranslated region, we simply deleted G and C in this loop to obtain mutant m13 or substituted the sequence of the loop with all U bases to obtain mutant m14. Both mutants (m13 and m14) exhibited dsRNA ratios of <0.5 (0.47 and 0.45, respectively, Figure 7B) while maintaining the original amino acid sequence of the encoding gene.",

The RNAs (mdv-\u03b1, m1, m3, m13 and m14) were mixed with a reconstituted translation system containing a fluorescent substrate and the omega protein, and the fluorescence was monitored during the incubation (Figure 7D). For mutant m3, which lost Loops 1\u20135, the fluorescence was at the same level as that with no RNA, while for the original mdv-\u03b1, mutants m14, m1 and m13 showed higher fluorescence than that with no RNA, indicating that these RNAs, except for m3, encoded active \u03b1-domain genes.

To further examine the generality of the rule, we investigated all sequence data of ssRNA viral genomes that have been registered in the NCBI database and analyzed the secondary structures to count the GC numbers in the loops. A plot of the GC number against the genome size revealed that the GC numbers in loops of the ssRNA genomes of bacteria and fungi are specifically localized to a region of <1 GC in the loops (Figure 8A), suggesting that the ssRNA viral genomes of these organisms obey the rule. Next, we applied the same analysis to bacterial and fungal viruses possessing other types of genomes (double-stranded RNA, single- and double-stranded DNA) (Figure 8B). The GC numbers in loops of other types of genomes are higher than those of ssRNA genomes, indicating that the rule of less GC number in loops is specific to ssRNA genomes. These results suggest that the rule obtained in the in vitro experiments using artificial RNAs is a general rule that governs natural viral ssRNA genomes of all bacteria and of most fungi presently known.",

Nevertheless, if this dsRNA formation mechanism is independent of the types of replication enzymes, this rule might be applicable to other RNA replications catalyzed by different replication enzymes, including ribozymes. The formation of dsRNA is considered to be a serious problem in RNA replication by ribozymes in the hypothetical RNA world (3) and in in vitro RNA replication systems (39).

            "text": "A remaining unanswered question is why the \u2018less GC in loops\u2019 rule is valid for bacterial and fungal virus genomes, but not for other higher organisms, such as vertebrates and plants. Some vertebrate or plant ssRNA viruses replicate with an intermediate dsRNA stage, known as replicative intermediate forms (RF). Examples of these are poliovirus (42), enterovirus (43), corona virus (44), tobacco mosaic virus (45) and cowpea mosaic virus (46). During the replication of these viruses, a single-stranded RNA genome is synthesized from the double-stranded intermediate form. Therefore, the nascent strand can be synthesized as a single strand, even if it possesses a high GC content in loop. Another possibility is that RNA-binding proteins might bind and inhibit the hybridization between a template and a newly synthesized strand. SsRNA viruses of vertebrates include clinically important viruses, such as coronaviruses and hepatitis C virus. Although further investigations are required, the discovery of the mechanisms that inhibit dsRNA formation in vertebrates might provide a new drug target for ssRNA virus infection.",
