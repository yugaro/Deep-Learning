            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of PED, was first described as a devastating enteric disease of pigs in the United Kingdom in 1971 (1). PEDV is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus that has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (2). PEDV infection induces diarrhea, causing high mortality in suckling piglets and weight loss in older hogs, which have led to significant economic losses in the swine industry (3). The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames encoding four structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope protein, and nucleocapsid protein (4). Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 protein has been considered a major target Ag inducing neutralizing Ab production, because it interacts with aminopeptidase N (APN), a functional receptor involved in PEDV infection, on the host cell membrane (5). Based on the observation that PEDV infection occurs mainly in epithelial cells of the small intestine via the fecal-oral route, and gross lesions are detected in the gastrointestinal tract of PEDV-infected animals, the establishment of mucosal immunity is required to induce protective immunity against PEDV infection (67). However, a mucosal PEDV vaccine is not available, and inducing mucosal immunity is difficult with current PEDV vaccine materials, which are administered intramuscularly, because the gut mucosa has a unique immune system, into which Ags enter only from the intestinal lumen due to the lack of afferent lymphatic vessels in mucosal immune-inductive site, compared with that of the systemic immune system. Interestingly, recent reports suggest that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein also interacts with 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, a possible sugar co-receptor, expressed on epithelial cells and aids in PEDV infection in the host (8). Consequently, use of the NTD as a mucosal vaccine material is a plausible vaccination strategy to protect against PEDV infection.",

PPs do not have afferent lymphatic vessels; therefore, the main gateway of Ags into PPs is via microfold (M) cells, specialized epithelial cells mainly found in the follicle-associated epithelium of PPs in the gut (10). M cells are distinguished from enterocytes by their unique morphological features, such as a thin glycocalyx, short and irregular microvilli, and an internal pocket containing Ag-presenting cells (APCs) (11). Luminal Ags transported across the interior of M cells interact with APCs, resulting in induction of Ag-specific IgA+ B cells. Dimeric IgA secreted from plasma B cells of the LP plays a major role as a mucosal defender through immune exclusion, intracellular neutralization, and Ag excretion (12). Consequently, it is required to induce pathogen-specific mucosal immunity to protect the host against pathogen infection in the mucosa.",

            "text": "To induce gut mucosal immunity against pathogen infection, targeting vaccine materials to M cells is the ideal strategy, because the uptake of luminal Ags is tightly regulated in gut epithelial cells (13). It has been suggested that targeting Ags to M cells can be enhanced by facilitating the interactions of Ag with M cell-specific molecules, such as GP2 protein, complement 5a receptor, and \u03b1 (1,2)-fucose-containing carbohydrate moiety (14-16). For example, tetanus toxoid can be targeted to M cells by complexing with an M cell-specific Ab (NKM 16-2-4), which interacts with \u03b1 (1,2)-fucose-containing carbohydrate moiety, and oral administration of the complex with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) effectively induces tetanus toxoid-specific immune responses in the systemic and mucosal compartments (16). In that sense, it is presumed that the NTD of the S protein of PEDV interacts with the mucosal surface based on its ability to interact specifically with 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid. In this study, we demonstrate that the partial NTD (NTD231\u2013501) of the PEDV S1 protein effectively interacts with M cells, and oral immunization of recombinant NTD231\u2013501 alone or together with the mucosal adjuvant CT induces Ag-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments. Consequently, we believe that recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein is a good candidate molecule for application in a mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection.",

The genomic sequence of the currently prevalent PEDV strain spreading rapidly in South Korea, the United States, and China differs from that of the CV777 strain (18). The BM1 strain of PEDV isolated from South Korea during October 2013 to June 2014 belongs to subgroup 2a, genogroup 2 of PEDV, and its genomic sequence is 99.2% similar to those of North American strains of PEDV (19). The S gene of PEDV BM1 strain consists of the S1 region (residues 21\u2013793) encoding the receptor-binding domain and the S2 region (residues 794\u20131385), involved in viral fusion to host cells. The S1 region in the PEDV BM1 strain consists of an NTD (residues 231\u2013501) with sugar-binding ability and a CTD (residues 502\u2013780) containing a pAPN-binding site (Fig. 1). Previous studies have suggested that the NTD has sugar-binding ability and aids in host receptor binding of PEDV (8). However, the role of the domain as a mucosal vaccine Ag has been poorly studied. We first attempted to express recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein and constructed pGEX 4T-1 encoding the NTD231\u2013501 gene with an N-terminal GST tag (Fig. 2A).

Based on these observations, we assumed that the NTD231\u2013501 interacts with specific glycan motifs expressed on M cells such as M cell-specific NKM 16-2-4 Ab. To this end, we aimed to determine whether recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein binds on the apical area of M cells. Therefore, recombinant NTD231\u2013501 was incubated with whole-mount PPs to monitor potential specific binding of the protein to the apical area of M cells (Fig. 3B). Recombinant NTD231\u2013501 localized to the apical area of M cells, which stained with NKM 16-2-4 but not with WGA.

To confirm the role of recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein as a mucosal Ag, we administered the Ag orally to BALB/c mice once a week for 3 weeks, and the level of NTD231\u2013501-specific serum IgG was monitored. The level of NTD231\u2013501-specific serum IgG2a was significantly (p<0.05) enhanced by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501 or NTD231\u2013501 together with the mucosal vaccine adjuvant CT, compared with administration of PBS (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that the elevation of Ag-specific IgG2a was closely related to induction of Th1-type immune responses and viral elimination in the systemic compartment (21). Oral administration of NTD231\u2013501 also resulted in increased levels of NTD231\u2013501-specific IgA in feces (Fig. 4B) and an increased number of NTD231\u2013501-specific IgA Ab-secreting cells in the LP, a mucosal immune effector tissue related to the level of mucosal secretory IgA (Fig. 4C). Collectively, we conclude that recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein is a candidate molecule for application in a mucosal vaccine, because its oral administration induces Ag-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments.",

Consequently, application of an oral mucosal vaccine using a recombinant Ag against the currently prevalent PEDV strains should be considered in the development of effective PEDV vaccines. One candidate Ag to be used as a recombinant PEDV vaccine is the S1 protein, although it is clear that the production of recombinant PEDV S1 protein in a prokaryotic expression system is not plausible. Herein, we addressed these issues and discussed the potential use of NTD231\u2013501 of the S1 protein from the PEDV BM1 strain, a currently prevalent strain in South Korea, as a mucosal vaccine candidate Ag.",

The NTD231\u2013501 gene of the PEDV S1 protein was inserted into the pGEX 4T-1 expression vector containing a thrombin recognition site for cleaving the target protein. After expressing the construct in E. coli (BL21 Star (DE3)), the recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein yield was 20 mg/L. Although host infection by PEDV begins with the interaction between the PEDV S1 CTD and APN of host cells, recognition of the sugar moiety by the PEDV S1 NTD is also critical in PEDV infection in host cells (8). Additionally, it was recently reported that knockout of porcine APN in swine testicle (ST) cells did not inhibit PEDV infection (24). Consequently, we were interested in determining the function of the NTD of the PEDV S protein. We found that the recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein produced in this study specifically binds to mucin and to the apical area of M cells.",

            "text": "Oral delivery of Ag can induce Ag-specific secretory IgA generation in the mucosal lining of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, salivary glands, and mammary glands (25). Therefore, we assumed that oral administration of Ag would be a suitable strategy to induce protective immunity against PEDV infection. However, a currently licensed oral mucosal subunit vaccine does not exist due to the lack of a mucosal adjuvant that can potentiate delivery of the Ag into M cells and enhance the immune response. In that sense, Ag, which is capable of targeting the Ag itself to M cells, is an attractive target for developing an oral mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection. For example, when fed orally, the rice-based cholera vaccine MucoRice-cholera toxin B subunit was taken up by M cells as a result of its M cell-targeting ability and efficiently induced cholera toxin B subunit-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments (26). Therefore, our finding that the NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S protein specifically targets itself to M cells suggests that NTD231\u2013501 is a promising Ag candidate for an oral mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection. More importantly, the Ag-specific IgG2a isotype, which was efficiently induced by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501, is closely related to the induction of protective immunity against a number of viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and yellow fever virus (11227). In addition, the Fc region of IgG2a activates Fc receptors with a high affinity by interacting with complement components, resulting in efficient induction of Fc receptor-mediated effector functions, such as Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and opsonophagocytosis by macrophages (28). Moreover, IgG2a production is closely associated with the induction of Th1-type immune responses (21). Consequently, we believe that Ag-specific IgG2a induction by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S protein is a promising strategy to develop an oral mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection.",
