To further simplify this system for engineering purposes and to minimize its immunogenicity, we tried to truncate the SpyCatcher protein while maintaining its conjugation activity. A structural analysis found that aa 53\u2013118 are probably essential for the conjugation activity. An immunogenicity analysis revealed four major immune epitopes at the N-terminus (aa 32\u201350, aa 57\u201366) and C-terminus (aa 104\u2013112, aa 121\u2013138) (Figure S1). Considering these together, we performed several truncations, as shown in Figure 1a. The truncation with deletion at the N-terminus (24\u201347 aa) was named SpyCatcher\u0394N, and the truncation with deletions at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus (24\u201347 and 121\u2013138 aa) was named SpyCatcher\u0394NC. The truncated SpyCatcher proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Figure 1b). The full-length and truncated SpyCatcher proteins were then used to immunize C57BL/6 mice. Fourteen days later, antibody levels in the sera were determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1c, the antibody levels induced by SpyCatcher\u0394N and SpyCatcher\u0394NC were significantly lower than those induced by full-length SpyCatcher. No significant difference was found between SpyCatcher\u0394N and SpyCatcher\u0394NC. Next, we further tested the efficiency of the binding of the truncated SpyCatcher proteins to the SpyTag fusion protein, \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag, which was made by genetic fusion of SpyTag with a single-chain antibody against murine DEC205 (\u03b1DEC205) at its C-terminus. As shown in Figures 1d and 1e, there was no significant difference in binding efficiency between SpyCatcher\u0394N and full-length SpyCatcher, consistent with the results of a recent study24. However, the binding efficiency of SpyCatcher\u0394NC was obviously lower than that of full-length SpyCatcher. Therefore, SpyCatcher\u0394N was chosen for further studies.",

The modified single-chain antibody \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was used as a functional unit in the present study. The OVA8-TBEV ED3 DNA sequence, which encodes model antigens including both a CD8 T-cell epitope (ovalbumin257-264) and a B-cell epitope (TBEV ED3), was genetically fused to the C-terminus of SpyCatcher\u0394N (Sc-OVA8-ED3). Conjugation of \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag and Sc-OVA8-ED3 would result in a fully functional vaccine (Figure 2a). \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was expressed in FreeStyle\u2122 293-F cells and purified by Protein A chromatography (Figure 2b, Lane 1). The Sc-OVA8-ED3 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (Figure 2b, Lane 2). The covalent binding reaction was tested under different conditions and with different molar ratios. A 1:1.5 molar ratio of \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag:Sc-OVA8-ED3 at 4\u00b0C for 2 h was found to give rise to an optimal binding efficiency for the proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that more than 90% of the input \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag was conjugated (Figure 2b, Lane 3). The synthetic DEC205-targeted vaccine (\u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3) was then purified by Protein A chromatography, with a purity above 90% (Figure 2b, Lane 4).",

After staining with a fluorescent secondary antibody, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3a, conventional DCs were gated as MHC class IIhigh and CD11chigh cells, and the CD8\u03b1+ DC and CD8\u03b1\u2212 DC subsets were then each further gated and analyzed. As shown in Figure 3b (top panel), the \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein preferentially bound to CD8\u03b1+ DCs, rather than to CD8\u03b1\u2212 DCs or other immune cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the specific expression of DEC205 on the former subset of DCs. To further test its targeting ability in vivo, na\u00efve WT mice were immunized with the \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein, together with CpG/Poly I:C. Next, 24 h after immunization, draining lymph nodes (DLNs) were isolated and digested to form single-cell suspensions. \u03b1DEC205 fusion protein-bound cells were visualized with fluorescent secondary antibody staining followed by flow cytometry. Preferential targeting to CD8\u03b1+ DCs was confirmed (Figure 3b, bottom panel). Thus, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system allows assembly of SpyCatcher fusion proteins with \u03b1DEC205-SpyTag, without influencing its DC-targeting ability.",

For the IFN\u03b3 intracellular staining assay, 5 days after the last injection, splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice and stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/ml OT1 peptide in a U-bottom 96-well plate for 6 h. The IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells were then stained and analyzed by flow cytometry. The splenocytes from the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3-vaccinated mice showed a significantly higher percentage of IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells compared with the splenocytes from Sc-OVA8-ED3-immunized mice (Figures 4a and 4b). For the in vivo specific killing assay, 4 days after the secondary injection, target cells (an equal mixture of OVA8 peptide-loaded, CFSE-high, labeled na\u00efve splenocytes and non-loaded, CFSE-low, labeled na\u00efve splenocytes) were transferred to the immunized mice. Next, 20 h later, the proportion of CFSE-labeled cells in the spleen was analyzed. A significantly higher specific killing rate was found in mice immunized with the \u03b1DEC205-Sc-OVA8-ED3 vaccine than in control-vaccinated mice (Figure 4c).

The discovery of effective antigens and immunomodulatory molecules is a major challenge in the field of vaccine development34. Modern immunology and genomics provide a large amount of candidates for each. Simple, rapid and efficient experimental screening of the optimal composition of a vaccine is generally in demand, especially when facing pandemic outbreaks of infections, such as SARS-CoV in 200325, H1N1 influenza in 200926 and MERS-CoV in 201227. The traditional de novo generation of gene-based synthetic vaccines is both time consuming and costly. In our present study, based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique, we have developed a novel method of vaccine construction by protein assembly based on pre-prepared vaccine components. We have employed this technique for the construction of a DC-targeting vaccine and have found it highly efficient to induce both T- and B-cell responses. Although this strategy still relies on genetic manipulation and protein production, it does not require synthesizing a large, complex fusion protein de novo every time; the strategy only produces smaller protein components as building blocks, which is easier and faster. This block-building strategy may allow people to construct various formulations of vaccines conveniently and efficiently when needed. The approach may simplify the whole process of vaccine generation and accelerate antigen screening and verification (Figure 6). In addition, certain vaccine components (building blocks) may be easily reused for the construction of other vaccines.",

            "text": "Different methods have been developed to construct synthetic vaccines. The traditional way is genetic manipulation, which provides great flexibility. However, this de novo generation usually takes a long time, and it is occasionally difficult to express large molecules. Chemical conjugation offers an alternative, fast way to overcome the shortcomings mentioned above. However, the chemical conjugation process is usually not easily controlled, resulting in poor homogeneity in terms of the degree of conjugation and the number of conjugation sites. An isopeptide bond is an amide bond formed between the side-chain amine of lysine and the side-chain carboxyl group of either glutamate or aspartate. This bond has been shown to be very useful for protein-protein coupling and protein modification28. SpyTag/SpyCatcher was recently developed and found to be highly efficient for site-specific protein conjugation. Impelled by the limitations of current methods for vaccine construction and inspired by the concept of synthetic vaccinology, we hypothesized that this new technique might be useful for easily and precisely assembling different vaccine components at the protein level. This approach may possess several advantages: (1) In contrast to genetic manipulation, this system does not generate a whole vaccine de novo; instead, it produces different protein components and assembles them as needed. This method may thus significantly reduce the time spent and the cost, especially when many designs need to be tested. (2) In contrast to chemical conjugation-based approaches, this system allows quantitative and site-specific installation of antigens at a designated position in the antibody that does not influence the antibody-targeting ability. (3) SpyTag and SpyCatcher can efficiently react with each other to form a stable covalent bond under diverse conditions. (4) SpyTag is reactive no matter it is at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or the internal site of a protein and therefore offers greater flexibility than other split protein-derived systems or intein/sortase tag systems do2930. In addition, recent work by the Howarth group has optimized this system to potentially provide further advantages31: (1) SpyCatcher can be shortened to KTag, allowing SpyTag and KTag to form a peptide-peptide ligation. Thus, this new system could further reduce the influence of SpyCatcher's own immunogenicity, if any. (2) The SpyTag-and-KTag system allows cycles of conjugation, which enables assembly of a vaccine with multiple components, such as protein-based adjuvants and multivalent antigens. (3) The short KTag makes high-throughput screening of epitopes feasible because the short KTag-epitope fusion peptides can be easily prepared by total synthesis.",

By taking advantage of a protein assembly-based method (right), each vaccine component can be prepared and then simply assembled into a full vaccine, as needed. This procedure could be easier, faster, more flexible and more efficient. Ag, antigen.",
