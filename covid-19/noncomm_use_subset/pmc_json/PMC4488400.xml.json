Some of the RT-PCR-positive samples were sequenced and primarily analyzed by\ncomparison of nucleotide sequences using the online Basic Local Alignment Search Tool\n(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to confirm the detection of astroviruses.\nSubsequently, we amplified the 3\u2032-end of ORF2 and the ORF1b/ORF2 regions, which have been\nconfirmed by subgenomic RNA analysis for characterization of astroviruses. Since the direct\namplification with gene specific primers (GSPs) failed, the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends\n(RACE) method was implemented to amplify the 3\u2032-end of the ORF1b/ORF2 region. The 3\u2032-end\nRACE amplification was performed as described previously [16] with the following modifications to the primer pair: QT 5\u2032-CCAGTGAGC\nAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCT (T)16-3\u2032 and QO 5\u2032-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACG-3\u2032. The RACE\nproducts were reused as templates in a nested PCR performed to amplify desired sequences\nusing GSPs designed in this study based on the B76-2/HK sequence available in the GenBank\ndatabase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) under the accession number HQ916317.1.The\nGSPs were designed using OLIGO 7 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Colorado\nSprings, CO, U.S.A.). The nucleotide sequences of the primer pairs used to amplify the\npartial 3\u2032-end of ORF2 were as follows: (forward, B1205F and B1350F)\n5\u2032-CAGGTCACCCCAGGCAACAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATCATACAGGCGGGCACGAGT-3\u2032, respectively, and (reverse,\nB1205R) 5\u2032-CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3\u2032 (expected products length, 1,200 and 1,426 bp,\nrespectively). The two primer pairs used to amplify the ORF1b/ORF2 region were as follows:\n(1) (forward, B-GSP2-2F) 5\u2032-AACAGC ACAGGGAGAGGTATAAGCA-3\u2032 and (reverse, B5130R)\n5\u2032-TGGCACGTGTTTCATAGGTCT-3\u2032 (expected product length, 1,850 bp); and (2) (forward, B1350F)\n5\u2032-ATCATA CAGGCGGGCACGAGT-3\u2032 and (reverse, B1205R) 5\u2032- CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3\u2032 (expected\nproduct length, 1,426 bp). For PCR, the final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5l\nconsisted of 2.5 \u00b5l of 10x L.A Taq Polymerase buffer, 4.0\n\u00b5l of dNTP mixture (2.5 mM each), 0.25 \u00b5l of LA\nTaq Polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.), 0.5 \u00b5l forward (DPF)\nand reverse (DPF) primers each, 2.5 \u00b5l of cDNA template, and 14.75\n\u00b5l of ddH2O. The PCR cycling conditions consisted of 95\u00b0C for 5 min\nfollowed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 52\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final\nextension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nInc., Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). 3\u2032-RACE PCR and amplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region were\nperformed under the same conditions as for the PCR analysis described above with cycling set\nat 58\u00b0C as the annealing temperature for 3\u2032RACE and 56\u00b0C as the annealing temperature for\namplification of the ORF1b/ORF2 region and an elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 1 min for each 1\nkb.",

Five of six isolates from water buffalo\n(BufAstGX M52, BufAstGX M53, BufAstGX M54, BufAstGX M541 and BufAstGX M552) clustered\ntogether appeared to form a new independent subgroup. However, one water buffalo isolate\n(BufAstGX 141) formed a new subgroup and appeared to be very closely related to the\nCcAstV-1/DNK/2010 isolate from a roe deer in Europe [17], suggesting that the Guangxi isolates from water buffalo could be classified\ninto two subgroups. Seven of eight isolates (BAstGX J7, BAstGX J8, BAstGX J22, BAstGX J23,\nBAstGX J27, BAstGX J251 and BAstGX 252) from Dairy Farm B formed a new subgroup, while one\nisolate (BAstGX G1) from Dairy Farm C formed a new subgroup on its own from other cattle\nisolates. Regardless of origin, the isolates from cattle were divided into three subgroups,\nwhile those from water buffalo were divided into two subgroups. However, five subgroups of\nthe Guangxi cattle and water buffalo astrovirus isolates belonged to one genogroup\npreviously composed of bovine and roe deer astroviruses (BAstv-B76-2/HK, BAstV-B18/HK,\nCcAstV-1/DNK/2010 and CcAstV-2/DNK/2010) in the genus Mamastrovirus,\ngenotype MAstV33 (Fig. 1a). To confirm this classification, we next constructed another phylogenetic tree based\non the seven predicted full-length ORF2 sequences deduced from amino acid sequences (five\nfrom cattle and two from water buffalo) obtained in this study together with other\nfull-length ORF2 sequences of other mammalian astroviruses retrieved from the GenBank\ndatabase. The phylogenetic relationships within the complete ORF2 sequences of different\nmammalian astroviruses were addressed in reference to the taxonomic proposals for astrovirus\nclassification criteria as described by the Astroviridae Study Group in\n2010, and each genotype was represented at least by one prototype strain. The obtained\nresults confirmed the classification under the genus Mamastrovirus,\ngenotype MAstV33, which, thus far, includes only cattle and roe deer\nastroviruses (Fig. 1b). Both the partial and full\nlength ORF2 sequences of water buffalo isolates constituted new subgroups in the clade of\nthe genotype MAstV33. The above results classified water buffalo as new\nhost species of the genus Mamastrovirus, genotype MAstV33\n(Fig. 1a and 1b).",

            "text": "Here, we detected a high prevalence of bovine astrovirus by RT-PCR from rectal swabs\ncollected from young calves of cattle and water buffalo with diarrhea. However, more studies\nare needed to determine whether the persistent diarrhea observed in these calves was mainly\nassociated with the high prevalence of astroviruses, as previous studies reported that\nbovine astroviruses were not directly associated with severe diarrhea in calves under\nnatural conditions [4, 24]. However, other reports [14, 26] indicated that bovine astrovirus may evolve to severe\ndiarrhea in co-infections with other gastrointestinal viruses, as in the case of BAstV\nco-infection with BRV or BToV (Breda virus) [26].\nNonetheless, the epidemiology of bovine astrovirus remains unclear, especially considering\nthe limited number of studies of cattle and water buffalo. While excretion of BAstV may\noccur in up to 60\u2013100% of calves on farms [4], only 5\n(2.4%) of 209 rectal swabs collected from asymptomatic adult cattle were positive for BAstV\n[21]. In the present study, sampling at different\ntime points demonstrated a high prevalence of up to 56.52% among calves with diarrhea.\nMoreover, in our complementary study, astrovirus was detected alongside other\ngastrointestinal viruses, including BEV, BCoV, BRV and BVDV, in 87.5% of cases.\nSurprisingly, 12.5% of these cases were positive for bovine astrovirus, but yet negative for\nother tested gastrointestinal viruses. In contrast, titers of BRV and BToV, which have been\npreviously reported as principal gastrointestinal co-infecting viruses with bovine\nastrovirus, were minimal or undetectable in this study. From these results, it is clear that\nastrovirus may be directly associated with diarrhea or possibly linked to other factors,\nsuch as poor hygienic conditions or associated with other non-viral pathogens, such as\nbacteria or parasites, which are known causative agents of diarrhea in calves. Similar\nresults were reported in Korea, where co-infection of bovine astrovirus with\ngastrointestinal viruses, other than BRV and BToV, was associated with clinical symptoms of\ndiarrhea in 20- and 14-day-old calves [14].",

Moreover, most sequences derived from one farm belonged to one subgroup, although\nsequence analysis clearly demonstrated origins from different strains. In addition, no\nsignificant genetic differences were observed between the bovine and water buffalo\nastrovirus strains investigated in this study (Table\n4). These results further support previous evidence that one farm could serve as\na reservoir of different bovine astrovirus strains, suggesting possible outbreaks of novel\nastroviruses due to mutation or recombination events. Notably, considering the history of\nastroviruses, recombination events have been described in cattle, swine, humans and poultry\n[19, 21,\n22], and co-infection of two different astroviruses\nin one head of cattle has been previously reported as well [21]. Consequently, it is important to screen for and control astrovirus infection\nin order to prevent eventual outbreaks of highly pathogenic astroviruses resulting in\nmutation or recombination events on farms. Furthermore, the astrovirus isolates from cattle\nand water buffalo isolated in this study displayed relatively close relationships,\nindicating that these animals were infected with diverse astroviruses, which probably\nevolved from the same viral ancestor. Consequently, given these close relationships,\nevidence exists of possible cross-infection between the two hosts; therefore, control\nmeasures against bovine astrovirus should also be taken into consideration when screening of\nviruses in water buffalo populations.",
