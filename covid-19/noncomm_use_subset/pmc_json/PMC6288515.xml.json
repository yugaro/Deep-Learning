A few studies have reported the characteristics of AFOP in recent years, but the etiology is still not fully understood. AFOP may occur at any age, but usually presents in the elderly people. The clinical presentation of AFOP is nonspecific and often similar to common pneumonia, so it is easily misdiagnosed. The confirmation of AFOP diagnosis depends on pathological biopsy.",

A pulse therapy of steroids was also administered in some fulminant patients[7,10,15,16]. Besides steroids, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine and azathioprine have been tried in AFOP patients complicated with connective tissue diseases[4,6,7,17]. In addition, Zhou et al[18] reported that low-dose indomethacin combined with methylprednisolone was a new choice of treatment. The role of anti-infective agents is not acknowledged, but in fact, most patients had been treated with sufficient anti-infective agents before a definite diagnosis could be established.

Although AFOP is a rare entity, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infection unresponsive to optimum antibiotic therapy. On the other hand, AFOP might be under diagnosed and under reported especially in the developing countries due to the complicated means of obtaining a tissue diagnosis which are not routinely performed in the community and secondary hospitals. Our case is distinct. The patient was an 81-year-old woman and she had a good response to short-term steroid treatment. The last follow-up showed that no relapse occurred during tapering steroids. This case will contribute to a better understanding of the treatment of AFOP in geriatric patients, and provide a new choice of dosage and duration of it. Further more studies are needed to describe various clinical aspects of this rare disease.",
