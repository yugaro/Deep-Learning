Prevalence of mental illness rose from 9.1% in 2006 to 10.2% in 2011, and a prevalence of a lifetime of mental illness increased from 12.6% to 14.4% [1,2] In spite of the high prevalence of mental illness, it was found that the proportion of patients receiving counseling from a psychiatrist or another mental health professional was 15.3% in 2011, and thereby approximately 85% of the patients had no experience of using mental health services [3]. Compared to 39.2% in the US (2010), 34.9% in Australia (2009) and 38.9% in New Zealand (2006), mental health services were significantly underutilized [4]. Thus, it is important to prepare national strategies for mental health problems in all age groups in Korea.",

Three research institutes affiliated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, (i.e. the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism), spent approximately 16%\u201317% of the total NIH budget in 2016 on R&D [10\u201313]. With respect to the proportion of investment, translational research, service and intervention research accounts for 35% or more in National Institute of Mental Health, and NIDA invests approximately 42.1% in translational clinical research and epidemiological research. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism actively performs and supports research for the prevention of alcohol abuse and addiction and its development, and carries out an exchange program with other nations and state governments [10]. In the UK, the R&D budget to support mental health was increased by 1.5% (about 58 million euros) from 2004 to 2014 [14], with approximately 45% of the proportion of national R&D healthcare investment for basic research (fundamental research, research for investigating the causes) from 2004 to 2014, 10%\u201317% for T1 (screening and diagnostic research, treatment development research), and about 45% for T2 (treatment evaluation research, research for prevention and health promotion, disease control research, and research for healthcare service), thereby indicating a high percentage of investment for translational and service research [14]. Australia emphasized mental health promotion amongst the general population, focusing on chronic mental illness patient care (1st\u20132nd plan), and prevention of mental illness in the high-risk group, and enhancement of mental health research support and service quality improvement (3rd plan) by establishing national mental health strategies as a 5-year plan from 1992. Currently in the 4th plan, the focus has been on prevention of mental illness and early intervention [15].",

In particular, it was shown that mental health R&D projects have great effectiveness in reducing socio-economic costs relative to the investment [8,16]. This is because disease prevention through early intervention and mental health promotion, may reduce national health expenditure, and indirectly improve human productivity, and reduce public sector expenses (for instance judicial administrative expenses) [8,16]. Mental health R&D investment in Korea, may be disparate at each research stage, and application and diffusion of research outcomes to local communities are insufficient compared to developed countries. Therefore, support and enhancement of translational research are required to improve mental health research [8,16\u201318]. This study was conducted as a preliminary analysis to examine R&D projects in mental health in Korea, and to evaluate crucial projects according to the relative priority of national policy coordination meetings assessing the mental health problem in 2016 [5]. This may be considered as the current national mental health policy of Korea. The aim of this study was to assess the validity in establishing medium- and long-term plans for national mental health R&D strategies.",

In addition, there are insufficient independent R&D projects, medium- and long-term R&D promotion strategies, and roadmaps that can play a central/integrated role in national mental health R&D [27]. In Europe, mental health research is developed through a medium- and long-term roadmap which focuses on 6 major priority fields for mental health and wellbeing in Europe. This process is based on translational research essential to field applications to offer assistance in solving mental health problems connected with overall issues including politics, society, and economy in Europe [28,29]. The National Institute of Mental Health in the USA also set 4 strategic objectives as a roadmap for mental health promotion. It promotes brain and behavioral science discoveries as priority, with a broad roadmap to influence public health for the next 5 years [30]. Therefore, the national mental health R&D investment and its supporting systems in Korea should be secured as a long-term policy.",
