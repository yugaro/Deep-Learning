The purpose of culture and susceptibility testing in cats with chronic bacterial URI is usually to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility of severe secondary bacterial infections that occur secondary to an untreatable underlying cause (eg, idiopathic inflammatory rhinitis). Antimicrobial treatment of these cats might provide relief from severe clinical signs, but it should be recognized that these cats will continue to be predisposed to opportunistic infections, often with antimicrobial\u2010resistant bacteria.

            "text": "The Working Group discussed whether antimicrobial treatment should be delayed while waiting until the results of culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are available. However, as not all clients can afford the diagnostic procedures and pneumonia can be a life\u2010threatening disease, the consensus opinion was to provide empirical antimicrobial treatment while waiting for test results with potential for de\u2010escalation of treatment based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. While hospitalized, parenteral antimicrobial treatment is generally recommended by the Working Group for the treatment of animals with pneumonia, regardless of the severity of disease. Once the animal is discharged, treatment can be continued by means of the oral route. It is the opinion of the Working Group that doxycycline is a reasonable empiric choice for dogs or cats with mild pneumonia that is suspected to be from infection with B. bronchiseptica or Mycoplasma spp. (eg, the animal is from a shelter or boarding environment) and no other systemic signs of disease like fever, dehydration, lethargy, or respiratory distress are present. This is based on the known susceptibility of these organisms to doxycycline (see Section on Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex) and published case reports of successful treatment with doxycycline (Table 2).74, 75, 78 Fifteen reviewers (88%) agreed and 2 (12%) disagreed with this Working Group recommendation. One reviewer stated that they doubted that pneumonia would be present without fever and if pneumonia exists, it should be treated with bactericidal drugs. The other dissenting reviewer commented on the lack of breakpoint data for doxycycline and the bacteria from dogs and cats as well as the concern that doxycycline might not penetrate into the extracellular fluids of the lungs.",

In 1 study, most bacteria from the lower airways of dogs with respiratory disease were susceptible to enrofloxacin.91 Other drugs for parenteral use with a Gram\u2010negative spectrum might be indicated in lieu of enrofloxacin based on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Table 2). The Working Group states that common options for Gram\u2010positive and anaerobic bacteria include ampicillin or clindamycin administered parenterally (Table 2). Which of these drugs to choose while waiting on antimicrobial susceptibility test results will depend on the most likely infectious agent suspected, previously prescribed antimicrobials (if any), and historical antimicrobial resistance in the geographical region. Fourteen reviewers (82%) agreed and 3 (18%) disagreed with this Working Group recommendation.
