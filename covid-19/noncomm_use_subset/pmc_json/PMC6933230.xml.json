            "text": "The decisions that individuals make over an epidemic outbreak depend on multiple factors. Here, they are assumed to depend on available information, misinformation, and the income/education of those making them (Del Valle, Hethcote, Hyman, & Castillo-Chavez, 2005; Fenichel et al., 2011; Herrera-Valdez, Cruz-Aponte, & Castillo-Chavez, 2011; Perrings et al., 2014; Towers et al., 2015). There are multiple possible scenarios that consider the decisions that individuals may make over the course of an outbreak. Individuals may modify their behaviors in order to reduce their environmental susceptibility to a disease by washing their hands frequently, avoiding handshakes and avoiding kissing salutes, not taking public transportation during rush hours, using masks and more. The frequency and effectiveness of these decisions may depend on the perceived risk of infection, a function of what each individual \u201cknows\u201d. In short, individual responses to new circumstances are adaptive and may depend on real or perceive risks of infection. Current disease prevalence, may become a marker or a tipping point, that when crossed, triggers individual or policy decisions. Whether or not individuals follow public health officials\u2019 recommendations may be a function of individuals\u2019 economic/educational status. The determination to make a drastic decision may be weakened or reinforced by each individual\u2019s networks of friends. Responses are altered by the opinions of work-related connections. Personal needs play a role, and they include the need to use public transportation or the desire to attend a social event.",

            "text": "The landscape where behavioral decisions take place is not fixed. On the contrary, it may be altered from within (individual decisions) or by the use of preventive or active public health policy decisions or recommendations, some \u201cobvious\u201d like vaccination or quarantine, others drastic like mandated social distancing, as in the 2009\u201310 flu pandemic in Mexico (Herrera-Valdez, Cruz-Aponte, & Castillo-Chavez, 2009). Now, whether the dynamical changes experienced by the socio-epidemiological landscape are slow or fast, will depend on many factors. It is within this, often altered, complex adaptive dynamical system, that individual decisions such as individually-driven social distancing, the use of face masks, frequent hand washing, increased condom use, and or the routine use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, takes place (Wang, Andrews, Wu, Wang, & Bauch, 2015). It has been theoretically and computationally documented (Barrett et al., 2009; Funk, Gilad, Watkins, & Jansen, 2009; Funk & Jansen, 2013; Hyman & Li, 2007; Misra, Sharma, & Shukla, 2011; Perra, Balcan, Gon\u00e7alves, & Vespignani, 2011; Tracht, Del Valle, & Hyman, 2010) that massive behavioral changes can impact the patterns of infection spread, possibly playing a critical role in efforts to prevent or ameliorate disease transmission. Today policies are implemented regardless of our knowledge of who are the \u201cdrivers\u201d responsible for inducing behavioral changes. Modeling frameworks exist that allow for the systematic exploration of possible scenarios. Through a systematic exploratory analyses of appropriately selected classes of scenarios, it is possible to identify possibly effective (model-evaluated) public health policies. The use of highly detailed models including individual-based models has some advantages since they can incorporate individuals\u2019 awareness of risk based on available of local information. The evaluations carried out on the effectiveness of changes, at the individual level, can be used to assess, for example, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing disease prevalence.",

These models have been used to explore the impact of behavioral changes on the spread of infection. In the review paper of Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2015) classify models as Rule-Based Models, those where individuals make their decision about changing behavior independently of others, and Economic-Epidemiology models (EE models), that is, models where individuals change their behavior in order to maximize their own utility function (what they value) subject to available resources. The EE models account for the responses that individuals take in response to infection risks on disease prevalence at the population level. The modeling and results reported in this manuscript are more closely related to those used in Rule-Based Models.",

These models have been used to study the dynamics of highly diverse diseases including, for example, influenza and HIV (Fraser, Riley, Anderson, & Ferguson, 2004; Poletti et al., 2011), or in the study of generic infections (Kiss et al., 2010; Misra et al., 2011; Perra et al., 2011; Poletti et al., 2009, 2012). Compartmental models (often using a phenomenological approach) categories designed to capture levels of awareness of infection. Such approach that can be used to incorporate \u2018awareness\u2019 in network models, is the objective of this manuscript. Some models assume that \u201cawareness\u201d spreads along with the invading disease, that is, through identical contact networks. Here, it is assumed that the disease and information spread over the same social network (a drastic simplification). The possibility that awareness and responses to the presence of a new infection among a subset of the population at risk, may significantly alter regular temporal patterns of disease prevalence (lower highs) have been studied. Studies have also shown that epidemic thresholds can be altered (Perra et al., 2011; Poletti et al., 2009; Sahneh et al., 2012) in response to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical intervention. Here, the focus is on the role of policy decisions/recommendations in altering disease dynamics, possibly the final epidemic size, within a model where awareness (generated by official actions) spreads among those susceptible to infection and their \u2018friends\u2019.",

Fig. (4) shows the results for network structures GE, GW, and GS. We observe that all networks, with or without awareness, support an outbreak for the chosen parameters (that is, the probability of extinction is low or the results are conditioned on non-extinction). Due to a lack of epidemic threshold for Scale-free network (Chowell & Castillo-Chavez, 2003; May & Lloyd, 2001; Moreno, Pastor-Satorras, & Vespignani, 2002), we always observe an outbreak with severity that depends on the initial infected index. For the other network structures, we observe an epidemic threshold depends on the network topology; specifically, on the average number of neighbors and the levels of heterogeneity in the number of neighbors (mean and variance of degree distribution) (Kiss et al., 2017). For example, for the case of Small-world networks Moore et al. (Moore & Newman, 2000) derived an analytic expression for the percolation threshold pc, above which there will be an outbreak. For the case when the network is homogeneous (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network), the epidemic threshold is proportional to the average number of neighbors (average degree) (Pastor-Satorras, Castellano, Van Mieghem, & Vespignani, 2015). Hence, for our simulation for both networks GE and GW we approximated the basic reproduction number using epidemic take-offs, when we had an outbreak, that is, whenever R0>1 (probability of extinction for the parameters used seemed to be negligible).",

Our result is also related to (Chowell & Castillo-Chavez, 2003), in which Chowell et al. tested the severity of an outbreak using an SIR model over a family of Small-world networks and an Scale-free network found out that the worst case scenarios (highest infection rate) are observed in the most heterogeneous network, namely, Scale-free networks.",

In our model infection spreads within an SIR framework while awareness disseminates only among susceptible individuals. Specifically, when a fraction of the infected people reaches a pre-determined threshold, public health officials start a massive information campaign on the risk and severity of infection. Information is transmitted by those not infected only. Awareness dynamics are triggered by public health authorities with the objective of conveying information about risk and severity of infection via aware susceptible individuals to unaware susceptible neighbors in the network. The level of awareness achieved is tied in to the educational level of each individual and the disease prevalence. Aware susceptible individuals can become indifferent, stop propagating information on the risk of infection, after sometime.",

These result are somewhat similar to those obtained by Chowell et al. (Chowell & Castillo-Chavez, 2003) and Moreno et al. (Moreno et al., 2002) as they studied the rate of infection rate of growth on an SIR model over Small-world and Scale-free networks, in the absence of awareness. These researchers observed that the spread of infection on Scale-free complex networks is faster than in a Small-world one. Pastor et al. (Pastor-Satorras & Vespignani, 2002) and Dezs\u0151 et al. (Dezs\u0151 & Barab\u00e1si, 2002) focused on identifying the best strategy that can be used to control (reduce) an epidemic peak on a scale-free network. They concluded that in order to control infection public health workers needed to immunize the hubs at an early stage. Our results are somewhat related, that is, we find that in order to control an infection, public health workers need to start awareness spread soon, that is, before hubs play the role of super-spreaders.",

This optimal point is the value that provides the best outcome under the prevalence P* at the time, t*, the time when temporary protection was promoted by aware susceptible individuals, Fig. 5a and 5b. The existence of this optimal P* is because of lack of enough infected cases to spread the infection for prevalence less than P*, and lack of enough susceptible individuals to protect themselves against the infection for prevalence bigger than P*. This trend is observed for more homogeneous network structures as the infection spreads more slowly than in heterogeneous networks such as Scale-free ones. For Scale-free network, for which there is no epidemic threshold, a monotonic increasing function final size is observed, a function of the prevalence threshold P*, there is no optimal point P* that minimizes infection final size, Fig. 5c.",
