In 2011, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korean Ministry of Environment began a program to collect information on individuals with respiratory disease, including lung injury, who presumed their disease to be related to the use of humidifier disinfectants (HDs), in order to determine the veracity of these claims. Approximately 75.6% of Korean children used humidifiers, and 31.1% of children were exposed to HDs.3 As of March 2018, the number of cases of respiratory damage reported by people who thought their diseases were related to HDs exceeded 6,000. Among these cases, to date, a total of 416 people (179 deaths and 237 survivors) have been judged as having suffered from HDLI.4",

For example, among the 474 people who were exposed to methyl isocyanate gas in India, the frequency of anxiety was 65% and depression 25% even 9 years after the disaster.13 Similarly, 32% of the Tokyo subway disaster victims exposed to sarin gas experienced PTSD symptoms even after 5 years.12 The reasons for psychological responses lasting for such long periods after disasters could include hidden exposure and prolonged potential complications including cancer and genetic disorders.1718",

Also, Brewin et al.20 reported that outreach with screening, linked to the provision of evidence-based treatment, significantly mitigated posttraumatic symptoms among London bombing victims. In addition to the absence of psychological support, there can be several stressors such as monetary compensation and legal suits that arouse prolonged psychological distress.

However, considering that psychological aftereffects of HD disaster have been disregarded due to the legal problems related to judgement and compensation, it is valuable to reveal the need of psychological intervention as well as financial compensation for the HDs victims. Further research is needed to elucidate the predictors of psychological responses and which way of intervention will be as effective when toxic chemical disasters occur.",
