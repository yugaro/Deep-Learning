Bovine RVAs\nare distributed to young calves worldwide and are causes of an economic loss in the cattle\nindustry [9, 13].\nSince there are many infectious causes for neonatal calf diarrhea, laboratory assays are\nrequired of diagnosis of RVA infection [3]. RVA is a\nnonenveloped, triple-layered icosahedral virus possessing an 11-segmented double-stranded RNA\ngenome that encodes six structural viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six\nnonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6) [3]. VP4 and VP7 are the outer capsid proteins that independently elicit neutralizing\nantibodies, which mediate protective immunity [3].\nSerotype is defined by a classification based on the neutralization of viral infectivity;\nhowever, the serotype of a rotavirus isolate can be predicted from the sequence of these\nregions [5]. Hence, genotyping is important for the\nclinician and diagnostician to obtain such information to interpret the results of vaccine\nstudies and epidemiologic surveillance [6, 7].",

First, total RNA was prepared from fecal\nsamples diluted 1:9 (W/V) in sterile PBS using ISGEN LS (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and this\nwas followed by DNase I treatment (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Quantification of the RNA samples was\nperformed using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). RNA samples were\nnormalized to 10\u2013100 ng of RNA, and RNA library preparation was performed\nusing a NEBNext\u00ae Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs,\nIpswich, MA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s intruction. Briefly, RNA was fragmented,\nand then double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. The resulting double-stranded cDNA was\nend-repaired before ligation of Illumina-specific adaptors and size selection of the libraries\nwith approximately 200 bp inserts and was finally PCR enriched. After assessing the library\nquality on a Bioanalyzer\u00ae (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.),\nsequencing was carried out on a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) using 51\nsingle-end reads. Data analysis was performed using the MiSeq Reporter Software (Illumina) to\ngenerate sequence data in FASTQ format. To obtain consensus sequences for 11 segments of\nbovine RVA, respectively, reads were aligned with the sequences of all 11 segments (G6-P\n[5]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3) of the bovine RVA\nstrain WC3 [1, 15] as reference sequences using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC bio, Cambridge, MA,\nU.S.A). For VP4, VP7 and NSP1, the sequences of NCDV Lincoln (P [1]), B223 (P [11]) [17], A5 (G8) [16],\n61A (G11) [15] and B383 (A13) [8] were also used as references.",

Though these methods are gold standards for diagnosis of bovine RVA,\nthey require expensive equipment and complicated techniques. In addition, it is difficult to\nisolate RVA using cell lines [18]. In the clinical\nfield, clinical veterinarians need rapid and sensitive detection methods that are routinely\navailable in daily clinical practice. Of the seven commercial kits in this study, the Dipstick\nshowed the highest sensitivity to the three bovine RVA strains, and these results were\nconsistent with those obtained with equine RVA [11].\nAlthough the sensitivity of the Dipstick was lower that than with RT-PCR, the Dipstick would\nbe useful for field diagnosis because of its simple, easy and rapid procedure. RT-PCR has been\nemployed as a useful method for the detection of pathogens. In Japan, the primer pair\nBeg9/End9, which has been applied to each human serotype virus [4], is usually used in livestock hygiene service centers for the detection and\ngenotyping of VP7 of bovine RVA. Genotyping VP7 using this primer pair is useful. In a limited\ndilution study, the primer pair Beg9/End9 amplified VP7 of KK3 up to a 103\ndilution; on the other hand, the primer pair BRVF/BRVR amplified VP6 of KK3 up to a\n105 dilution. The reason for this may be the variability of the VP7 reverse\nprimer region, and this indicates that amplification of VP6 is better for detection of bovine\nRVA.",
