FCoV consists of two biotypes\nincluding feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIP virus (FIPV). FECV infection is\nasymptomatic or exclusively causes mild gastrointestinal clinical symptons, while FIPV causes\nfatal symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distention and neurological\nsymptoms in young cats [2, 13]. The clinical symptoms differ depending on the form and organ\ndistribution of the lesion, and in cases with lesions in central nervous system, neurological\nsymptoms such as depression, ataxia and seizures appear in 85% of cases [15]. It was assumed that FIPV originating from FECV acquired its monocyte-\nor macrophage- tropism responsible for viral dissemination and developed specific FIP lesions\ndue to vasculitis [17, 18].",

These lesions\nare often accompanied with granulomatous or necrotizing phlebitis and/or periphlebitis, which\nhave been considered as a typical hallmark of FIP [3,\n10]. Lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) are\nfrequently observed mainly in the leptomeninges, ventricles, choroid plexus and sometimes\nneuroparenchyma [5, 12, 16]. Although histopathological features\nof FIP lesions in the CNS have been well documented [6,\n14, 15], the\nassociation between inflammatory cell types and the distribution of viral antigens remains to\nbe clarified. The present study describes the inflammatory cell types and viral antigen\ndistribution in the brain lesions of 4 cats diagnosed as FIP. Also, considering that the FIPV\nhas monocyte and macrophage tropism, immunohistochemical examinations were performed using two\nkinds of macrophage markers: CD204 (monocyte and macrophage marker) and Iba-1 (microglia and\nmacrophage marker).",
