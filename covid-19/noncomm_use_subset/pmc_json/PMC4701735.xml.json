            "text": "Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been widely used as human and veterinary drugs, especially for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases in domestic animals, poultry, and fish [21]. FQs act through inhibition of DNA-gyrase, abolishing activity by interfering with the DNA rejoining reaction [314]. The widespread use of FQs has led to contaminating residues in foodstuffs derived from treated animals, which can induce unwanted reactions such as erythema, burning, and itching in humans and animals [25]. Furthermore, antibiotics released into the natural ecosystem can modify the local environmental microbiota by changing the composition or activity [123]. Many regulatory agencies have established a maximum residue limit for FQs in milk, meat, and other foods [56]. For example, the maximum sum of enrofloxacin (ENR) and its metabolite ciprofloxacin in muscle was set at 100 \u00b5g/kg for all animal species in the European Union [14].",

            "text": "Conventional methods such as liquid chromatography coupled to various detectors including ultra-violet (UV), mass spectrometry, or fluorescence detection are used for detection of drug residues [231]. These techniques have been shown to be highly specific and sensitive, but such traditional methods require expensive equipment and interpretation of complicated chromatograms or spectral results [13]. Therefore, a rapid, reliable, and easy screening method is required for monitoring of large samples [4]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is based on specific antigen-antibody interactions, is the most suitable method for rapid screening of ENR residue in the veterinary field [2930]. Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies have been developed for use in immunochemical detection assays [920]. Many organic solvents or immunoaffinity columns are required to separate FQs from the matrix to enable their analysis. The magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) has emerged for various applications such as gene and drug delivery, treatment of disease, and diagnosis [1124]. MNP can bind to different functional groups such as oligonucleotide probes, antibodies, and proteins to produce nanoprobes [19]. Previous studies have indicated the usefulness of nanoparticles for identification of pathogenic bacteria in DNA-microarrays, isolating target organisms from food matrices and screening metal ions in water [81726]. Additionally, we reported a rapid purification method using monoclonal antibodies against mycotoxin and MNPs [18].",

The IC50 data of anti-ENR-HRP conjugate binding to six FQs analogs were analyzed to investigate the relationship of the anti-ENR-HRP conjugate affinity with the structural factor of the FQ analogs. The IC50 values of the FQ analogs demonstrate that loss of the cyclopropyl group and 4-ehtyl-piperazinyl ring of ENR have various effects on antibody binding. The structures of ENR and ciprofloxacin are very similar in all respects except for the ethyl group in the piperazinyl ring, which is substituted by hydrogen. Similarly, an analogous comparison of ciprofloxacin to norfloxacin results from alkyl substitution on the piperazinyl ring and cyclopropyl group replaced by a fluorophenyl group or ethyl group, which produces an increase in the IC50 value. These results indicate the possibility that anti-ENR strongly recognizesthe cyclopropyl group and the ethyl group in the piperazinyl ring, leading to its higher reactivity with the antibody. According to other reports, the cross-reactivity of anti-ENR mAb produced in the laboratory for ciprofloxacin and sarafloxacin was100% and 16%, respectively, indicating that the antibody strongly recognized oxygen and fluorine atoms [16].",
