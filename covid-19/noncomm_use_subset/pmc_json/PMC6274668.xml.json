More than 90% of these cases were reported from six countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates) making MERS one of the biggest health security threats in the Region. Based on past experience, and as demonstrated by the recent case of MERS in Republic of Korea with travel history to Kuwait, the virus can spread internationally as well, raising global health concerns.",

With this three-day workshop, WHO\u2019s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean aims to establish a pool of MERS experts that can be deployed rapidly during any future outbreaks, in the Region and globally.",

These include avian influenza and other influenza and novel viruses. Additionally, the workshop will allow the participating experts to share and discuss the latest evidence on MERS, review key action points regarding surveillance, field investigation, infection prevention and control, early detection, prevention and response, review operational checklists, and participate in a simulation exercise to better prepare for deployment.",
