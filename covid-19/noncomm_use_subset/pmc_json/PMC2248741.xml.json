Approximately one third of the probes had between 1 and 20 randomly introduced mismatches. The plus and minus (reverse complement) strands of each sequence were deposited, in duplicate. In addition to the flaviviral specific probes, the array contained nearly 36 500 probes for other viral families, negative and positive controls.

The number of mismatches was calculated for each expected probe-target pair. The change in Gibbs free energy at 65\u00b0C (hybridization temperature) was calculated using PairFold version 1.7 (27) as a separate measure of probe-template binding strength. PairFold employs a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the minimum free energy structure (excluding pseudo-knots); the standard free energy model is used (28) with empirical nearest neighbor energies (29).

            "text": "Probe sequence composition is a major determinant of hybridization signal and is responsible for much of the variance between probes that target the same nucleic acid strand. Probe-target thermodynamics have been successfully modeled to predict fluorescence (41,42), control for variance (43) and even estimate concentrations of target detected in samples (44). Observing that some probes with more than five mismatches to their targets showed strong fluorescent signal, we concluded that sequence composition is a major factor in our array platform. We sought to validate the probe design method by generating a simple thermodynamic model to predict hybridization signal based on sequence composition. We computed the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) for all expected probe-viral nucleic acid pairs in the West Nile virus hybridization experiments described above. The calculation method employed finds the most thermodynamically stable structure (minimum free energy) (28) based on empirically established nearest neighbor energies (29). Strong signal was observed from probe-virus hybrids with \u0394G of \u221232.5 kJ or less. Thus, this value was chosen as the threshold to classify a probe as likely to generate high signal when the cognate viral target is present (Figure 6).\n",

Viral microarray probe design poses unique challenges due to the rapid increase in sequence data and the high propensity for sequence divergence within viral taxa. To ensure coverage of the newest isolates it is essential to consider partial as well as complete genomic sequences in probe design. Probe design based on multiple alignments or pairwise comparisons of nucleic acids for all known sequences is computationally intensive and scales poorly with database size. Protein sequence comparisons are rapid and incorporate rich evolutionary models, but require a cumbersome mapping step to extract underlying nucleic acid sequence. We have described a method that capitalizes on the Pfam protein alignment database and a motif finding algorithm to automate the extraction of nucleic acid sequence for probes from conserved protein regions. The protein motif-centric method has several advantages: (i) the majority of viral nucleic acid sequences encode proteins; thus, using this information leverages knowledge about function; (ii) protein sequence comparison and the resulting probesets are independent of viral taxonomy; this may enable incorporation of misclassified sequences; (iii) the Pfam is a well established and highly annotated database that will provide a basis for future design efforts; and (iv) probes designed in conserved regions may be able to detect novel viruses.",
