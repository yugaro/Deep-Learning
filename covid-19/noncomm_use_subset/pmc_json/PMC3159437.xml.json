            "text": "There are two types of exceptions to universality of the genetic code. In one, the meaning of a codon is globally reassigned in a context independent manner (1). In the other, codon redefinition is in competition with standard decoding and it is codon context dependent (2). Though there is an example where the meaning of a sense codon is redefined (3), most cases of codon redefinition involve one of the three stop codons of the standard code (UGA, UAG or UAA) specifying an amino acid at least a proportion of the time that it is decoded. Where the significant feature of stop codon redefinition is to allow ribosomes to continue translation into a downstream open reading frame (ORF), rather than the identity of the amino acid specified, then it is generally termed stop codon readthrough (RT) (4). In contrast, when selenocysteine or pyrrolysine are specified by UGA or UAG, respectively, then the important features are the special properties of these non-universal amino acids (5\u20137). Both types of non-global codon redefinition are just one aspect of the variety of ways (collectively referred to as \u2018recoding\u2019) in which genetic readout can be dynamically altered in a site- or mRNA-specific manner (8,9).",

Of great interest was the discovery that RT of the coat protein (CP) gene terminator of the phage Q\u03b2 yields a greatly extended protein that is important for viral propagation (17,18). Shortly afterwards, studies that utilized purified yeast suppressor tRNAs in in vitro experiments found that several plant viruses, including tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV), also utilize RT to express their replicase proteins (19\u201321). Similarly murine leukemia gammaretrovirus (MuLV), whose relevant sequence is identical to that in xenotropic MuLV-related virus (XMRV), utilizes RT of the gag gene terminator to allow ribosomes to enter the pol gene and synthesize the Gag-Pol polyprotein that is the source of viral reverse transcriptase (22,23). MuLV Pol binds to the translation release factor, eRF1, and non-interacting mutants of Pol failed to synthesize adequate levels of Gag-Pol to permit replication (24). This raises the possibility of temporal control of RT (25). The efficiency of RT in the Drosophila gene kelch also appears to be developmentally regulated (26). Two other Drosophila genes are known to employ RT\u2014headcase and out-at-first\u2014though another approximately 150 candidate cases have recently been identified via comparative genomic approaches utilizing sequences from 12 Drosophila species (27\u201329). Although some of these candidates may actually be cases of alternative splicing or RNA editing, the indication is that utilized RT may be significantly more common in cellular organisms than previously supposed.",

For SINV, primarily on the basis of in vitro translation studies, the only contextual feature reported to be important for RT was the identity of the cytidine nucleotide immediately 3\u2032 of the stop codon, directly analogous to the results of the early stop codon leakiness studies (32). Similarly, in the tobraviruses (specifically tobacco rattle virus) and, by implication, the pecluvirus, furovirus and pomovirus replicase gene, and the furovirus CP-extension gene, it has been reported that RT of the UGA stop codon might depend on just the three 3\u2032-adjacent nucleotides (33). For these plant viruses, and alphaviruses that utilize RT, the consensus motif in wild-type (WT) viruses is UGA-CUA or UGA-CGG (34). In contrast, for TMV (where the RT codon is UAG), plant tissue culture experiments showed that the 6 nt immediately 3\u2032 of the stop codon are relevant, with the consensus motif for efficient RT being UAG-CAR-YYA (35,36). The same motif is utilized by a number of other plant viruses, while the motif UAG-CAR-NBA stimulates RT in yeast (37). In terms of 5\u2032 stimulatory motifs, adenines at the \u22121 and \u22122 nucleotide positions have been shown to positively modulate RT in yeast and are a feature common to many virus RT sites, notably in the tobamoviruses, poleroviruses and luteoviruses (38).",

The location of the pseudoknot (8 nt 3\u2032 of the stop codon) may permit it to act at the mRNA unwinding site half-way through the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome (43). A very different stimulatory element is present in the plant luteoviruses, where RT at the end of the CP gene produces a much larger CP-extension protein that is important for aphid transmission (44). In the best-studied of these viruses, barley yellow dwarf, both 3\u2032-adjacent sequences and an element \u223c700\u2013750 nt 3\u2032 of the UAG stop codon have been identified as important for RT and long-range RNA base pairing between the 3\u2032-proximal and 3\u2032-distal elements has been suggested as a possible mechanism (45).

Thus we hypothesized that, at least in vivo, RT in SINV and other alphaviruses might be modulated by additional sequence elements. To test for the existence of such elements, we investigated the degree of phylogenetic conservation at synonymous sites downstream of known RT stop codons in alphavirus genomes, and then extended the analyses to other RNA viruses and selected cellular RT genes. Regions of enhanced conservation at synonymous sites are indicative of overlapping functional elements such as RNA secondary structures or primary nucleotide sequences with functions in addition to amino acid coding. In many cases, and in particular those cases where RT of a UGA codon had been previously assumed to be stimulated simply by the 3\u2032-adjacent nucleotides CUA or CGG, we found considerably enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in the 3\u2032-adjacent sequence, typically extending over a region of 100\u2013200 nt 3\u2032-adjacent to the stop codon. Here, we computationally and experimentally explore these conserved regions and their significance for RT.",

            "text": "The genus Alphavirus encompasses approximately 30 described species, many of which infect humans and livestock, causing rashes, painful arthritis, fever and potentially fatal encephalitis (reviewed in reference 47; see reference 48 for a phylogeny). Transmission is generally via arthropods such as mosquitoes. The single-stranded positive sense genomic RNA is about 11\u201312 kb long and contains two long ORFs separated by a short non-coding sequence (Figure 1A). The 5\u2032-proximal ORF codes for the non-structural proteins nsP1\u2013nsP2\u2013nsP3\u2013nsP4 while the 3\u2032-proximal ORF, which is translated from a subgenomic RNA, codes for the structural polyprotein C-E3-E2-6K-E1 and, via programmed ribosomal frameshifting, C-E3-E2-TF (49). In SINV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV), western equine encephalitis (WEEV) and related alphaviruses, a UGA stop codon separates the coding sequence for nsP4 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) from the coding sequence for nsP123 (30,50). In contrast, the salmonid alphaviruses lack the UGA stop codon while, for alphaviruses in the Semliki Forest complex, the stop codon tends to be present in some but not all strains even within a single species, possibly as a result of conflicting selective forces in alternating arthropod and vertebrate hosts (passaging in cell culture may also drive selection for or against a stop codon at this location; see ref. 51 and references therein).\n",

The procedure takes into account whether synonymous site codons are 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold degenerate and the differing probabilities of transitions and transversions. Briefly, for a given pair of sequences within an alignment, a codon position was defined as a synonymous site if the same amino acid was encoded in both sequences. A \u2018null\u2019 substitution model was defined such that the relative probability of each possible synonymous codon substitution (including substitution with itself) at such sites may be calculated by assuming that the component nucleotides evolve neutrally. Neutral evolution was modelled using a Kimura nucleotide substitution matrix with \u03ba = 3 (59). For each sequence pair, the divergence parameter t was set so that the total expected number of nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites under the null model was equal to the total observed number. Next, the difference between the expected number and observed number of nucleotide substitutions was calculated at each synonymous site in the pairwise comparison. The variance at each site was calculated from the expected probabilities of each possible synonymous codon substitution, assuming a multinomial distribution. Statistics were summed, at each alignment codon position, over a phylogenetic tree as described in ref. (60). Finally the statistics were averaged over a sliding window. An approximate P-value (probability that the mean conservation in the sliding window would be as high as observed if the null model were true) was also calculated, under the assumption of a normal distribution as an approximation to the sum of many independent multinomial distributions.",

For an alignment of 63 VEEV, EEEV and WEEV sequences, this analysis revealed significantly enhanced conservation in a region comprising the \u223c140 nt 3\u2032-adjacent to the RT stop codon and a 9-codon sliding window size clearly resolved the conservation into two distinct peaks (Figure 1B). Inspection of the sequence alignment demonstrated the potential for base pairing between the sequences corresponding to these two peaks to form a stem\u2013loop structure. In VEEV, the 5\u2032-end of the 5\u2032 component of the stem is separated from the stop codon by an 8\u20139 nt \u2018spacer\u2019 and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 components of the stem are separated by a less-conserved \u2018loop\u2019 region (which may nonetheless contain structured elements) of 101 nt (Figure 2). The predicted stem has 11\u201312 bp with a 1 nt asymmetric bulge in the centre of the 5\u2032 component and, despite the enhanced conservation, is further supported by a compensatory A:U to G:C substitution that occurs in some strains at the fourth base pair from the \u2018top\u2019 of the stem. In EEEV and WEEV, the predicted stem has 10 bp with a 1 nt asymmetric 5\u2032 bulge, and is separated from the stop codon by a 9 nt \u2018spacer\u2019 (Figure 2). Again, the predicted stem is supported by a compensatory G:C to A:U substitution in the related Fort Morgan virus (FMV). High conservation was also noted for the 1\u20132 codons immediately 3\u2032-adjacent to the 3\u2032 component of the predicted stem in VEEV, EEEV and WEEV.\n",

In the furoviruses, the RT context is generally UGA-CGG (UGA-UGG in the highly divergent sorghum chlorotic spot virus, AB033692) and there was evidence for tandem synonymous site conservation peaks and an associated stem\u2013loop structure that, together with a 7 nt \u2018spacer\u2019, covered 96 nt 3\u2032-adjacent to the stop codon (Figures 3 and 4). In the pomoviruses, however, the RT context is generally A-UAG-CAA-UYA (A-UAA-CAA-UUA in the highly divergent broad bean necrosis virus, D86637) and the synonymous site conservation analysis failed to reveal extended conservation in the vicinity of the RT site (Figure 4). Thus the furovirus context and predicted structure is alphavirus-like while the pomovirus context and lack of predicted structure is tobamovirus-like (see below). The animal-infecting coltiviruses also have an alphavirus-like RT site (UGA-CGG) in the VP9/VP9\u2032-coding sequence and, again, there is potential to form a 3\u2032-adjacent RNA stem\u2013loop structure (Figure 3; as noted previously in ref. 65), which is tentatively supported by our conservation analysis (Figure 4).\n",

In the case of the tobamoviruses, greatly enhanced synonymous site conservation is seen from codons \u22121 to +3 relative to the UAG stop codon, and the motif xxA-UAG-CAA-UUA-xxG is completely conserved in the 105 sequences analyzed (despite lack of amino acid conservation at the \u22121 and +3 codons). However, more extended conservation of the type seen in the alphaviruses was not observed (Figure 4). In the luteoviruses and poleroviruses (family Luteoviridae), the stop codon context AAA-UAG-GUA is completely conserved in all except one of 247 sequences analyzed (rose spring dwarf-associated virus, EU024678, has GAA-UGA-CGG), and enhanced synonymous site conservation was also observed over several further codons, especially codons \u22121 to +5. However, while this region may well interact with distal elements as discussed in ref. (45), the extended 3\u2032-adjacent conservation of the type seen in the alphaviruses was not observed in the Luteoviridae (Figure 4). The highly conserved local nucleotide contexts of the different RT sites mentioned here have been noted, discussed and characterized in detail in a number of previous works (34 and references therein).

To address base pairing within the predicted stem, two mutations were constructed that were predicted to disrupt Watson\u2013Crick interactions: 3 G residues in the 5\u2032 part of the stem were changed to Cs or 3 C residues in the 3\u2032 part of the stem were changed to Gs (Figure 6C).

However, when the two mutations were combined such that the predicted base pairings were restored, RT recovered to near the WT level (Figure 6A and B, lane 7). The importance of the sequence between the two halves of the stem (referred to here as the \u2018loop\u2019 region but without implication about internal structure) was tested by deleting all but 5 nt of its sequence. Interestingly, this resulted in substantially higher RT than the WT level in both assay systems (Figure 6A and B, lane 8).",

Computational analyses provide strong evidence that similar structures are relevant for RT in several other alphaviruses, and in plant viruses where RT occurs at a UGA codon. Although this RNA structure is clearly not essential for some level of RT to occur in some systems [as in many previous analyses the predicted WT structure was not present (32,33,74) and, in our own experiments, \u223c1% RT was achieved in tissue culture without the WT structure], it does have a pronounced stimulatory effect on RT efficiency (3- to 4-fold for SINV, 10- to 14-fold for VEEV). As with the gammaretrovirus 3\u2032 pseudoknot, the precise mechanism by which the stem\u2013loop affects RT remains to be determined. Possibilities include direct interaction with the ribosome (including pausing and/or promotion of conformational changes in the ribosome); provision of a physical block that preferentially occludes release factor from the A-site in favour of tRNAs; or an indirect action via some trans-acting factor. The function of the RNA structure may simply be to achieve a higher RT level that is optimal for the virus. Alternatively, the structure may provide a regulatory mechanism, perhaps allowing different RT levels to be achieved in different hosts or at different stages in the viral cycle.",

While long-distance base pairings have been demonstrated to play important regulatory roles in RNA viruses (reviewed in ref. 75), the distances involved in the RT base pairings identified here are very much smaller and a genome-scale regulatory role seems unlikely. Furthermore, our loop-deletion mutant promoted even higher RT than the WT construct, suggesting that the presence of a long loop region, or any sequence motifs therein, play little if any role in stimulating efficient RT. Thus, we hypothesize that evolutionary selection simply acts to place the 3\u2032 component of the stem in a convenient location (e.g. with regards to minimizing interference with the encoded amino acid sequence). Although we refer to the region between the two components of the stem as a \u2018loop\u2019, it should not be taken to imply that this region does not fold. In fact the region generally is predicted to fold, and the fact that it can fold may indeed be functionally important\u2014perhaps just to provide stability to the basal stem. However, in most cases, the nature of the fold seems to be relatively unimportant as it is not well-conserved between related sequences.",

There are several possibilities. Previous analyses of the RT cassette in SINV alphavirus, and also tobacco rattle tobravirus, were performed in in vitro systems (32,33). However, RT efficiency may vary considerably between in vitro and cell culture systems, depending on the absence or presence and abundance of various relevant near-cognate tRNA species (34), and potentially also on the concentration of various trans-acting factors, salt concentrations, temperature, ribosome loading density and intracellular architecture. Thus a high RT efficiency measured in vitro for a short insert does not mean that the full complement of elements that stimulate efficient RT in cell culture or in vivo has been recapitulated faithfully. Such factors may also explain why our in vitro experiments produced much lower RT efficiencies than previous in vitro experiments, and highlight the importance of our experiments in mammalian cell culture (32,76,77). Although ref. (32) compared, in vitro, the RT efficiency for a short insert (that excluded the predicted structure) with a long insert (comprising the entire nsP3 + nsP4-coding sequences), such comparisons between inserts of very different sizes are not always straightforward, in part because the different protein products may be degraded at different rates, and because chance base pairings with the construct sequence could affect RT efficiency differently for the long and short inserts. In contrast, guided by our computational analysis, we were able to make small but targeted substitutions that allowed for more precise comparisons in the context of a long VEEV insert that included the predicted RNA structure elements. Accurate measurements of the RT efficiency in alphavirus-infected cells are not readily obtainable due to the multiple cleavage products of the non-structural polyprotein and rapid degradation of excess nsP4 (31,47,78). Nonetheless, in ref. (31), 5- to 8-fold less nsP34 was found in WT SINV-infected cells than in cells infected with mutant viruses in which the UGA was replaced by a Ser, Trp or Arg codon, thus suggesting a WT RT efficiency in the range 12.5\u201320%. Our measurement of \u223c7% for WT VEEV and SINV sequences in the dual luciferase construct suggests that there may be additional factors that affect alphavirus RT.",

In eukaryotes, this process is dependent on an RNA stem\u2013loop structure containing specific nucleotide motifs, known as the SECIS element, usually located in the 3\u2032-UTR of the corresponding mRNAs (5,6). In certain cases, an additional stem\u2013loop structure close to the recoded stop codon has also been identified (79,80). For example, in the human SEPN1 gene there is a phylogenetically conserved 16 bp stem (with a 1 nt symmetric bulge) and a 5 nt loop, separated from the UGA by a 6 nt spacer. Interestingly, this structure has been shown to stimulate RT in cell culture (but not in vitro) even when the SECIS element is absent. Howard et al. located potential 3\u2032-adjacent structures for at least 5 of 36 human selenocysteine-encoding UGA codons analyzed. However, their initial computational selection involved RNA-folding of just nucleotides +1 to +60 of the human sequence\u2014an analysis which would have missed most of the 3\u2032 RNA structures predicted in this report. Thus 3\u2032-adjacent structures may be a feature of a larger proportion of selenocysteine RT sites than these, though it does not appear to be an essential feature for selenocysteine RT (61).",

There are exceptions to the rule (e.g. enamovirus UGA-G, various pomovirus cases with atypical stop codons, and so on). One reason for this may be that the required level of RT may vary between different viruses, and may also be modulated by other sequence elements (e.g. 5\u2032 nucleotide and/or amino acid context) so that, in certain cases, deviations from one of the \u2018canonical\u2019 RT motifs may be tolerated. With this proviso, our results suggest that the definition of the Type II motif should, in general though perhaps not ubiquitously, be modified to include a 3\u2032 RNA structure component. Our discovery in alphaviruses and phylogenetically supported predictions for many plant viruses and the Drosophila gene kelch, together with the small number of previously identified cases of structure-stimulated RT, now suggest that 3\u2032 RNA structures as a component of efficient RT cassettes in eukaryotes (especially those that lack a CAR-YYA tobamovirus-like stimulator), rather than being exceptional, may in fact be the norm.",

The following reference sequences (GenBank accession numbers) were used: VEEV NC_001449, SINV NC_001547.",
