However, there are also some viral NTDs, including rabies and the major arbovirus infections, such as dengue and yellow fever. A universal feature of the NTDs is their disproportionate impact on populations living in extreme poverty (Box 1).

However, while modeling and other evidence support the economic dominance of NTD and antipoverty vaccines, these aspects by themselves have not yet been sufficient to promote substantial and timely global investments. In the end, the long-time horizons, risk of failure, and absence of robust commercial markets make vaccines daunting financial investment prospects. Fueling investor hesitancy are the recent shortcomings and public reactions to newly introduced vaccines for malaria and dengue despite billion-dollar investments from Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur, respectively,30,31 on top of an accelerating global antivaccine movement. Still another factor is the fact that recent financial \u201cpull mechanisms\u201d such as advanced market commitments and priority review vouchers so far benefit only larger for-profit organizations that have the ability to use internal resources in order to advance development of products.

These challenges are due to multiple global, regional and national issues which will require increased global efforts to promote more R&D, increase immunization campaigns, reduce vaccine hesitancy and address the systemic weaknesses that are limiting equitable vaccine access.30,31 Furthermore, and to enhance the knowledge-sharing and the collaborations for the R&D and translational science agenda of the GVAP, WHO, in partnership with the US National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH-NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have launched the Global Vaccine & Immunization Research Forum (GVIRF) held every two years.38 The latest forum, held in 2018, included a special focus on the GVAP goal to develop and introduce new and improved vaccines and technologies with an emphasis on the thought-processes to develop robust business cases with full public health value propositions (FPHVP), which are needed to make decisions for an end to end development, integration and delivery. This initiative, supported by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization,39 provides the framework starting during the early stages of vaccine product development to ensure a clear definition of the global value of vaccines, allowing accurate prioritization and eventually avoid delays in the uptake especially in (LMICs).40 Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has also made significant progress in support of making vaccines more equitable, affordable and accessible.41",

More recently, the NIH through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has made selective gap funding available to PDPs through their contracting mechanisms. Such funds have it possible to participate in the NIAID-NIH network of Vaccine Trial Evaluation Units (VTEUs), and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology contractors, which were critical path elements of advancing our schistosomiasis vaccine. NIAID-NIH has also directly supported the early clinical trials of the hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccines. Outside of NIH, the Department of Defense (DOD) has provided some needed support for early-stage vaccine development through its Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP), which was instrumental in advancing our leishmaniasis vaccine. In the United Kingdom and Europe, promising research into vaccines has been supported through organizations such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative with European Commission funds such as those coming from the Horizon 2020 mechanism, but similarly, as in the US, these mechanisms do not typically bring innovative discoveries into a commercialization path.

Therefore, these vaccines will need to rely primarily on public markets in LMICs and high-risk development prospect and with the added difficulty of predicting the accurate return on the investments. A recent observation that a surprising burden of NTDs occurs among the poor living in a wealthy group of 20 nations (G20), a group sometimes referred to as the \u201cpoorest of the rich\u201d potentially points a way to bring in G20 government investments from outside the US, United Kingdom, and Europe.52 However, this framework known as \u201cblue marble health\u201d has not yet been widely accepted by the leaders of G20 and their policymakers.",

To attract investors better transparency is needed to predict R&D spending, clinical development and market entry, which generally can span between $200 and $900 million.Organizational, methodological, and cultural barriers within and among research institutions are necessary.We urgently need innovation in the finance sector to identify a new sustainable business model for these urgently needed technologies.We propose a new call to action for NTD vaccines.",
