These communities may be derived from bioreactors, environmental, clinical, or industrial samples; in short, from anywhere in our unsterile biosphere. The classical questions in metagenomics that are asked about the sampled microbial community are \u201cWho is there?\u201d and \u201cWhat are they doing?.\"1 Originally an approach to answer these classical questions, metagenomics as a field has made great progress in the past decade. Applications include the use of metagenomics for the discovery of novel genetic functionality,2 for describing microbial ecosystems and tracking their variation,3 in untargeted medical diagnostics and forensics,4 and as a powerful tool to determine the genome sequences of rare, uncultivable microbes.5",

However, a persistent concern in the analysis of metagenomes has been the unknown fraction, consisting of the reads that cannot be annotated by using database searches.

This is both overwhelming and exciting, highlighting how much remains to be discovered in biology. This genetic diversity has been referred to as biological \u201cdark matter,\"11,12 and is especially pronounced in viral metagenomes.8 This issue can only be resolved by expanding reference databases, as exemplified by recent studies of one of the most studied microbial ecosystems: the human gut. The first metagenomic snapshots of the microbiota in the human gut were taken from 2 healthy adults, and revealed a high inter-individual diversity and many unknowns.13 To a large extent, these unknowns were resolved when a reference catalog was created based on the sequences in the gut metagenomes themselves, decreasing the percentage of unknowns from \u223c85% to \u223c20%.14 Moreover, subsequent large scale sequencing efforts revealed that in fact, many people share a similar intestinal flora, regardless of whether these similarities are viewed as discrete enterotypes15 or as gradients.16 These results illustrate how unknowns can be depleted by expanding the databases with appropriate reference sequences. This not only requires increased sequencing effort of phylogenetically diverse isolates17 or single cells,11 but also mining of draft genomes from metagenomes,18 sampled from microbial environments around the globe.19 Thus, by mapping the global sequence space, we can provide reassurance that at least some level of sampling saturation can be achieved.

Because the advances in DNA sequencing technology have greatly outpaced improvements in computer power,20 bioinformatic approaches to analyze metagenomes often cut corners. For example, reference databases may be reduced to include only those references that are expected in the sample a priori. Moreover, read annotation may be limited to identifying almost exact sequence matches, as this can be computed much faster than if sequence variations needs to be taken into consideration in a permissive homology search. These issues lead to an inherent blind spot for discovering true novelty, such as sequences that are not expected in the sample, or organisms that have not been observed before. One way to, at least partially resolve this issue is by de novo assembly of the metagenome. Depending on the diversity of the sample, assembly can combine many short sequences (individual reads) into fewer, longer ones (assembled contigs). Reducing the number, and increasing the length of the sequences allows homology searches to be performed with more sensitive, computationally more expensive algorithms such as translated homology searches or profile searches, leading to more specific annotation and improved biological interpretation. Moreover, larger and more comprehensive reference databases can be used, allowing unexpected hits to be found.",

Most research projects that generate metagenomic sequencing datasets deposit the read files in large repositories, provide an accession number in the associated publication, and move on. It is not unlikely that many of these data sets, consisting of files sometimes gigabytes in size, are never looked at again. Thus, while a certain sequence may have been \u201cseen\u201d in a metagenome and is thus strictly no longer \u201cdark matter,\" it will still not be recognized when it is observed again. Re-identification of this sequence would only be possible if the publishing researcher identified it as an interesting sequence in his or her (assembled) metagenome, and submitted it to a searchable database like Genbank.21 Because GenBank maintains very high standards for the sequences it accepts, submission can be a tedious process that is rarely worthwhile for unknown metagenomic contigs. An in depth investigation of the unknowns is rarely within the scope of a research project, and those sequences are thus first ignored and later forgotten. This is a waste of valuable resources: time, money, and work. The metagenomes available in public databases should be better exploited and mined for common sequences. To facilitate this, it is critical that metadata annotations of the metagenomes include a detailed description of the samples and sequencing protocol.22 Exploiting these datasets will allow us to create more comprehensive maps of sequence space, and greatly improve our understanding and interpretation of metagenomes.",

Besides sequencing reference strains or single cells, it may be expected that metagenomic sequencing, assembly, and binning will greatly add to improving these reference databases, for example by identifying common sequences in many metagenomes, and prioritizing them for targeted characterization. Characterizing unknowns will be vital to fully exploit the increasingly available metagenomic data sets from all ecosystems, toward understanding the roles of microbes and viruses in the biosphere.
