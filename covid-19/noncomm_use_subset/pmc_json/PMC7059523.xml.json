Affective risk perception proportion was defined as the number of participants who were \u2018worried\u2019 by the number of eligible respondents.

Trust in government includes expectations of government\u2019s competence to prevent people from risk and develop and implement follow-up measures.31 This trust concept can be termed competence-based trust.32 33 We tried to assess the competence-based trust in the government using presidential job approval rating. Presidential job approval was evaluated using the question \u2018Do you approve or disapprove of the way President Park Geun-hye is handling her job as president?\u2019 and required the following responses: \u2018approval\u2019, \u2018disapproval\u2019.

The association of education with affective risk perception was non-significant except university degree in the overall survey (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.96). Lower economic status and those living in metropolitan cities paid more attention to the affective risk of MERS-CoV in the overall model.

Those who did not support the president were reported to have had higher risk perception in both the affective and cognitive levels. In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension. In the early days of the MERS-COV outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scienti\ufb01cally uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did the government disclose which hospitals the con\ufb01rmed patients had visited. This resulted in increased public distrust in the government.4 5 8 9 Similar patterns of distrust in the government were associated with the spread of infection, during the outbreak of Ebola.34 35 Those who disapproved of the ruling party had also higher risk perceptions. Identification of party can be classified in the political aspect of trust.36 There is need to investigate further comprehensive understanding of trust\u2019s effect on risk perception.",

Further research is needed to determine why the same female group showed differences in perceived risk for affective and cognitive levels. The older the respondents, the lower the perceived cognitive dimension, but the opposite occurred weakly in the affective risk perception. The correlation with age and affective risk perception was not significant in most models (survey 1, survey 2 and survey 3 models).
