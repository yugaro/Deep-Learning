Moreover, one case of W. chondrophila-associated miscarriage was documented by immunohistochemistry, specific PCR and micro-immunofluorescence (MIF) 6. These observations are of major importance, since human miscarriage has no aetiology in about 50% of cases and since 32% of women with miscarriage exhibited anti-Waddlia antibody reactivity 5. In addition, W. chondrophila may also represent a novel agent of respiratory tract infection since its DNA was detected by PCR in (1) 9.4% of nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from children with bronchiolitis and tested negative for the respiratory syncytial virus 7, and (2) the sputum sample of a patient with pneumonia 8.",

The extracellular infectious elementary body (EB) infects host cells and then differentiates into a replicative form called the reticulate body. The obligate intracellular lifestyle of the members of the Chlamydiales order has rendered their detection by culture particularly tedious. The diagnosis of these bacterial infections is thus now mainly performed using molecular tools and/or serology. The current reference standard method in chlamydial serology remains MIF, based on whole-cell bacteria, despite its lower sensitivity compared to ELISAs 9,10. Moreover, MIF is a time-consuming and fastidious technique, in which there is almost no automation and which is largely dependent on a reader's objectivity. Conversely, although ELISA is more difficult to implement, it has the advantages of being easily automated, providing quantitative results and allowing large-scale screenings of samples.",

Furthermore, when testing human sera known to exhibit anti-Waddlia reactivity, their reactivity against each of the 13 individual proteins identified by Kebbi-Beghdadi et al. 12 was heterogeneous, with only a third of sera reacting against some of these 13 proteins. Finally, two candidates were identified as putative immunogenic proteins for the development of an ELISA.

The children with pneumonia were sampled at day 0 (serum A) and day 14 (serum B) during the course of their disease.

Sera from British women (tested in MIF) were systematically added in each experiment to calculate receiver operating curves (ROCs) and to define a grey zone: sera above, inside and below this zone were considered positive, doubtful or negative, respectively. When the sera from children were tested by the W. chondrophila specific ELISA, the patients were considered positive when seropositivity was observed in the three independent experiments.",

Proteins were first loaded on a 12% acrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie blue. Then, the gel was excised from the loading point to the bottom into five equal bands that were subsequently digested with trypsin (Promega) 14,15. The derivated peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS on a hybrid linear trap LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) coupled to a nanocapillary HPLC with a C18 reversed-phase column. Analysis of the raw data was performed by Mascot Distiller 2.3.2 and Mascot 2.3 (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the Uniprot database (http://www.uniprot.org) restricted to Waddlia chondrophila WSU 86-1044 and against a custom-built database containing the sequence of common contaminants (enzymes, keratins). Trypsin (cleavage at K, R, not before P) was used as the enzyme definition. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. The iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification. N-terminal acetylation of protein, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of methionine were specified as variable modifications. The software Scaffold version 3 was then used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications and to perform dataset alignment. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 90.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm 16. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Protein Prophet algorithm 17 and contained at least two identified peptides. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. The relative abundance of the proteins identified was estimated using the calculation of an exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) 18. Details of this index can be found at the website http://www.matrixscience.com/help/quant_empai_help.html. This index was based on the theorical and observed number of unique peptides after trypsin digestion of the proteins: emPAI = (10^(Nobserved/Nobservable) \u2212 1, with N for the number of peptide.",

A MIF protocol based on heat-inactivated bacteria (hereafter called \u2018h-MIF\u2019) and read at a magnification of \u00d7400 was compared to a MIF protocol using formalin-inactivated bacteria (hereafter called \u2018f-MIF\u2019) read at a magnification of \u00d71000. In a previous study, 95 samples of serum taken from British women tested with the h-MIF 5, were tested in this work by the f-MIF. The number of positive, negative or doubtful serology for W. chondrophila is summarized in Table1. The number of doubtful results was 1.4 times higher with the h-MIF compared with the f-MIF. When comparing results of the f-MIF with the h-MIF, the overall correlation was 39% considering positive, negative and doubtful sera. Fig. S1 illustrates the validation of the ELISA using both MIFs as a reference standard. In Fig. S1a, sera from British women which tested positive and negative with both MIFs (n = 32) were analysed by the ELISA. The results indicated that the ELISA was able to discriminate between positive and negative sera. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the ELISA, ROCs were calculated using the OD492nm values obtained with positive and negative sera according to the h-MIF or the f-MIF (Fig. S1b). The mean area under the ROC for h-MIF or f-MIF (Fig. S1b) was 0.968 \u00b1 0.012 and 0.967 \u00b1 0.010, respectively. These values close to 1 showed the high performance of the ELISA. The statistical analysis using the unpaired t test demonstrated that MIF-based negative and positive human sera were significantly discriminated by the ELISA (p value <0.0001 for both MIFs). Considering OD492nm values that gave 100% specificity, the ROCs proposed cut-offs corresponding to the highest sensitivity. Overall, five and eight independent experiments of ROC were performed for h-MIF and f-MIF, respectively. The calculated OD492nm cut-off for the ELISA based on the h-MIF gave a mean sensitivity of 71.7 \u00b1 11.3%. For the ELISA based on the f-MIF, the optimal cut-off gave a mean sensitivity of 86.6 \u00b1 3.0%. For each experiment, the optimal determined cut-offs were applied on all the 95 sera tested with the ELISA and each serum was classified according to the serological results obtained with the h-MIF (Fig. S1c) or with the f-MIF (Fig.2). In the ELISA based on the f-MIF, mean OD492nm values increased when the score of the MIF increased. With 100% specificity for the ELISA based on both MIF, the sensitivity of the ELISA was higher when based on the f-MIF (Fig. S1b). The f-MIF was thus chosen as the best reference standard to calculate OD492nm cut-offs for the ELISA in the subsequent experiments. All \u2018doubtful low\u2019 sera taken from British women were also used to define a high threshold. Thus, the calculated cut-off using the ROC and the high threshold determine a grey zone (Fig. S1c and Fig. 2). The sera with OD492nm values above, inside or below this grey zone were then considered in the next experiments as positive, doubtful or negative, respectively.",

            "text": "Waddlia chondrophila is now emerging as a human pathogen. In order to specify the pathogenic role of this bacterium, tools allowing large-scale screenings are needed. As serology is one key approach for diagnosing infections due to such strictly intracellular bacteria, the development for an ELISA specific of Waddlia chondrophila was warranted. Commercial chlamydial ELISA assays or anti-Chlamydia vaccines often use recombinant membrane proteins such as the major OMP (MOMP) or the outer membrane complex protein B (OmcB) with good reliability 19,20. The cell wall of Chlamydia species is organized in a complex of disulfide cross-linked proteins whose major components are the MOMP, OmcA and B providing rigidity to the bacterial membrane 13,21. The genome of W. chondrophila did not reveal any MOMPs but instead 11 cysteine-rich outer membrane proteins (Omp) 11. A potential Omc family with OmcA and B and a putative polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp) were also identified. Cross-linked chlamydial outer membrane proteins were already documented as being insoluble in the detergent sarkosyl 21 as well as being highly immunogenic 22\u201326. Indeed, the outer membrane proteins of Waddlia represented good antigen candidates for the development of serological tests. Therefore, the elementary bodies of Waddlia were used to prepare an enrichment of outer membrane proteins. These proteins were then coated as antigens in the present ELISA, which showed high responses with homologous mice and rabbits anti-sera as well as the absence of significant cross-reactivity with sera specific of other members of the Chlamydiales order. No animal serum reactive against the more phylogenetically distant members of the Chlamydiaceae family was tested in this work. However, no cross-reactivity was observed for the closest relatives of W. chondrophila. Moreover, C. trachomatis positive Waddlia negative human sera from British women (n = 10) were negative with the new ELISA, indicating that Chlamydiaceae-specific animal sera will unlikely exhibit cross-reactivity with Waddlia-enriched outer membrane protein fractions used in this ELISA. Furthermore, dominant outer membrane proteins of Waddlia (i.e. Omp proteins) showed no homology with members of the Chlamydiaceae family.",

In this work, when comparing two different protocols of MIF (using heat- and formalin-inactivated bacteria; h-MIF and f-MIF, respectively) the correlation was 39%, revealing a weak robustness of this technique. The limit of the MIF was already highlighted for C. trachomatis serology when comparing a commercial MIF with four additional commercial serological tests 9. Nevertheless, no alternative method could be used as a \u2018reference standard\u2019 to validate the new ELISA. The correlation between the MIF and the ELISA, illustrated by the ROCs based on positive and negative sera, was excellent (area under the curve >0.96). The MIF based on formalin-inactivated bacteria and observation of the sample at a magnification of \u00d71000 demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity of the MIF method. Indeed, the number of detected seropositive sera from British women was higher and the number of doubtful results reduced with the f-MIF compared to the h-MIF. The new ELISA was validated using serological results from British women tested previously by h-MIF and in this work by f-MIF. The sensitivity of the ELISA was higher when correlated with the results of the f-MIF than with the h-MIF (86.6% vs. 71.7%), indicating that the f-MIF is an optimization of the MIF protocol. The formalin inactivation may better preserve the integrity of bacterial membrane structures and epitopes compared to heat inactivation. This latter method likely significantly damaged the bacterial membrane, exposing to the surface intracellular epitopes from numerous conserved proteins which may increase the number of false positive or doubtful results. In addition, in the f-MIF protocol, fluorescence was observed at a magnification of \u00d71000, which enabled a better distinction between the fluorescence of stained bacteria (W. chondrophila) from background fluorescence or from non-specific staining, a distinction which was not possible at the magnification \u00d7400 used in the h-MIF.",

Nevertheless, MS also detected inner membranes and cytoplasmic proteins, illustrating that the enriched membrane fraction was contaminated with proteins not located in the outer membrane. Working with this undefined preparation of proteins has some disadvantages since it is a complex mixture that is difficult to quantify and with a relative composition subjected to variation between different protein preparations. Thus, the ELISA settings required a new optimization of the conditions of the ELISA for each protein preparation. Using 2D gels and immuno-blots with Waddlia-positive and -negative human sera, the main putative immunogenic proteins unique to Waddlia were identified and would represent good candidates as antigens for the future development of a Waddlia-specific ELISA based on recombinant proteins. As the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA is probably based on the immunogenicity of different proteins and not on a single protein, the use of several candidates should be favoured for future development of a Waddlia-specific ELISA. Several putative immunogenic proteins such as GroEL, the elongation factors Tu and G are much conserved bacterial components among bacterial species. They were recognized by Waddlia-positive and -negative human sera (Fig. S2) and thus should be avoided. The eight identified putative uncharacterized proteins, showing Waddlia-specific immunogenic properties and low or no identity with other Chlamydiales proteins should be considered (Table4) as best putative candidates for the development of a defined Waddlia-specific ELISA.",
