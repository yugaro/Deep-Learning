Thus, in a hospital-based severe epidemic outbreak, the general practitioner has to be competent in all fields while taking a strong interest in clinical epidemiology.",

This term address the consequences of the non-agreement between the doctor and the patient as in the chaos described in the Stacey diagram [5], developed for management issues, which shows how chaos surges from the discrepancy between the meeting of the uncertainty of the supplier (here, the doctor) and the consumer (here, the patient). It also highlights how complexity is the core problem of health care [6]. Public health specialists are aware of the chaos provoked some years ago by the predicted epidemic of H1N1 [7].",
