Advances in understanding bronchiolar disorders in humans have been hampered by lack of a widely accepted classification scheme because of different viewpoints of clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists. In humans, bronchiolar disorders are classified by inciting cause (eg, infection, drug related, immune\u2010mediated, or occupational or environmental exposures), clinical sequelae (eg, restrictive, obstructive, or mixed disorders), imaging, histologic features, or some combination of these.11, 14, 15 Bronchiolar disease can be focal or diffuse, acute, or chronic, inflammatory or fibrotic, and confined to the lungs or develop as part of a variety of systemic diseases.8, 9 In primary bronchiolar disorders, disease centers on bronchioles and spares other parts of the respiratory tract. In secondary bronchiolar disorders, disease extends to small airways from either the large airways or pulmonary parenchyma (eg, interstitial lung diseases [ILDs]).10 Bronchiolar disorders, although recognized in humans, have not yet been described as distinct clinical entities in veterinary medicine.",

Known or suspected exposures causing bronchiolar disorders in humans have been reviewed11 and include chemicals (eg, cleaning compounds, pesticides, artificial flavorings), inhalant particulates, animal or mineral dusts, and gas and smoke inhalation. Previously, environmental bronchiolar disorders were thought to be an acute sequela to a severe, overwhelming exposure, but more recently, disease with an insidious onset of clinical signs without a recognized overexposure event (perhaps representing cumulative smaller exposures) or a mild single exposure has been appreciated.24 Injury to bronchiolar epithelial cells leads to inflammation and a fibroproliferative repair response, ultimately resulting in mural fibrosis (constrictive bronchiolitis) or intraluminal fibrosis (proliferative bronchiolitis).25 Four histopathologic types of disease have been proposed: cellular bronchiolitis (inflammatory infiltrate of the bronchioles), constrictive bronchiolitis (concentric fibrosis of the wall leading to narrowed airway caliber), proliferative bronchiolitis (polyps of connective tissue within the bronchiolar lumen), and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (proliferative bronchiolitis with polyps extending into the alveolar ducts and alveoli).11\n",

Furthermore, there is no distinctive recognizable pattern of analogous bordering venules and lymphatics arranged in discrete polyhedral shapes that might comprise this unit. Thus, even in disease, pathology on CT scans of cats would not reflect distribution around a pulmonary lobule. Terms used in imaging of human lung such as centrilobular, panlobular, interlobular, and intralobular are not appropriate descriptors in cats. Dogs are similar to cats and also lack secondary pulmonary lobules, and the pulmonary acinus has been suggested to be the important high\u2010resolution CT (HRCT) unit of the canine lung.26 The acinus is defined as the region of the lung supplied by a single terminal bronchiole, representing the smallest functional unit of the lung. Because it is smaller than the secondary pulmonary lobule that is the smallest visible structure on HRCT, we believe that the pulmonary acinus is not a replaceable term as the important HRCT unit of the feline (or canine) lung. Instead, descriptors of collective changes of multiple acini visible on HRCT will need to be developed and refined.",

Thoracic radiographs in humans with bronchiolar disease may be normal or show nonspecific changes such as hyperinflation, nodules, and reticular to alveolar infiltates.11, 21 In our experience, thoracic radiographs in cats with histologic evidence of bronchiolar disease can have bronchial or bronchointerstitial patterns (with or without bronchiectasis), patchy alveolar patterns, ill\u2010defined nodular opacities, and hyperinflation or hypoinflation. The radiographic appearance of histologically confirmed bronchiolar disease in cats does not present as a single pathognomonic radiographic pattern, but is highly variable, reflecting the different diseases encompassed in the spectrum of bronchiolar disorders. Importantly, without clinical recognition of these disorders, bronchiolar disease is not considered as a differential diagnosis. In humans, HRCT has been instrumental in improving diagnosis of bronchiolar disorders, establishing them as important disease entities in pulmonary medicine. With more commonplace use of CT in cats, we are recognizing some features similar to those described in humans.

These signs include centrilobular nodules (humans only), tree\u2010in\u2010bud pattern (nodular opacities connected to branching linear structures originating from a single stalk reflective of impacted debris, cells, or fluid within bronchioles), peribronchiolar ground glass opacity or consolidation, and dilatation (bronchiolectasis).5, 14, 27 Indirect signs reflect changes to the pulmonary parenchyma distal to the diseased bronchiole and include mosaic attenuation (because of air trapping) or, in the setting of bronchiolar disorders, rarely mosaic perfusion.27 Because air trapping may be imperceptible on inspiratory images, expiratory scans are crucial to accentuate air trapping.8 Direct findings reflect inflammation or proliferative changes within the bronchiolar lumens, whereas indirect findings reflect fibrosis within the bronchiolar wall (eg, constrictive bronchiolitis).8\n",

            "text": "Definitive confirmation of bronchiolar involvement requires histopathology. The microscopic anatomy of bronchioles is similar between humans and cats. Distal bronchioles are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium supported on a thin lamina propria and surrounded by smooth muscle. Airways end as respiratory bronchioles before the alveolar parenchyma in the cat (Figure 1) and in humans. Microscopic morphology has been used to categorize lesions as inflammatory or fibrotic, recognizing there are a limited number of ways airways respond to injury.9 Inflammatory or cellular lesions often are subcategorized as acute, chronic, acute on chronic, granulomatous, or eosinophilic. Fibrotic lesions reflect the site affected (intraluminal or intramural); overlap in inflammatory and fibrotic changes can be noted within the same patient.9 Multiple wedge biopsy specimens are recommended to capture patchy and sometimes subtle lesions.29 A particular histologic pattern of disease may have a wide variety of causes. For example, inflammatory bronchiolitis can be caused by infection, aspiration, transplant rejection, and extension from large airway disease or systemic collagen vascular disease, among other causes.9 Fibrosis may be a sequela to chronic inflammation so that in end\u2010stage disease, the inflammatory etiology can be missed. Thus, classification schemes based solely on histopathologic features are likely to be less clinically useful, and multidisciplinary input should be sought to allow meaningful interpretation of histologic findings. This should not dampen enthusiasm for the central role of histopathology in an understanding of bronchiolar disorders. In fact, in humans, histopathology may be the only means to document bronchiolar disease in the subset of symptomatic patients with normal lung function (as assessed by spirometry, diffusion capacities, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing) and normal HRCT scans.30\n",

Additionally, it is critical to realize that veterinarians are likely to detect bronchiolar disorders late in the disease course for several reasons: (i) cats hide respiratory disease well, (ii) aggressive diagnostic testing, including lung biopsy, is rarely advocated unless underlying disease is serious and there are potentially treatable differential diagnoses, (iii) serious disease is associated with anesthetic risk, and (iv) advanced diagnostic tests are expensive. Detection of end\u2010stage lesions will not provide much needed clues about common underlying etiologies because the inciting factor may be gone, and there are likely many insults that share a final common pathway with similar clinical, physiological, and histologic appearances.25 At the present, we believe that CT provides the best minimally invasive antemortem evidence of bronchiolar disease in cats.

The owner herself recently had been diagnosed with small airway disease. Thoracic radiographs showed hyperinflation, a diffuse bronchial pattern, a multifocal unstructured interstitial pattern with progression toward an alveolar pattern, lung atelectasis, subpleural thickening, and bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis in peripheral opaque regions (Figure 2 A, B). The cat did not respond to multiple courses of antibiotics or antifungal drugs but had a partial clinical response to prednisolone. The cat died and was submitted for necropsy. Grossly, the lungs were hyperinflated. Histologically, mixed chronic inflammation involved the pulmonary interstitium and was especially prominent in subpleural areas (Figure 2 C). Respiratory bronchioles were obliterated by loose fibrous tissue (Figure 2 D). The lesions noted in this cat represented a spectrum of early (markedly inflammatory) and late (predominantly fibrosis) foci. Furthermore, although distribution was centered on small airways reflective of a primary bronchiolar disorder, there was extension into the interstitium with a subpleural distribution.

The large area of complete opacification on the CT scan comprised confluent inflammation, and the smaller nodules on CT corresponded to affected small airways on histopathology. Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus was negative. Trichrome staining identified minimal fibrosis of alveolar walls; periodic acid\u2010Schiff staining was positive in smooth muscle of respiratory bronchioles. Immunohistochemistry performed to identify CD3+ T cells, CD80+ B cells, and E\u2010cadherin showed a mixed population of cells consistent with inflammation. Polarized light failed to identify particulates. Owners were instructed to bring the cat back for baseline pretreatment thoracic radiographs after healing from the thoracotomy and before starting immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids. They were unable to do so until 10 weeks postoperatively. At that time, evaluation of thoracic radiographs indicated dramatic improvement of previously documented lesions in the absence of any treatment (Figure 9 A,B). It was unclear if this improvement was a result of spontaneous remission or waxing and waning disease. Other primary bronchiolar variants are described in Box 5.",

With more common use of CT, lesions suggestive of small airway (bronchiolar) disorders are being detected. Clinical signs and some features of thoracic radiographs can be identical for large and small airway disorders, making additional diagnostic testing necessary for definitive diagnosis. We used CT and histopathologic examinations in cats with a wide spectrum of clinicopathologic features allowing proposal of an initial classification scheme for bronchiolar disorders. Broadly, diseases of the bronchioles can be subdivided into primary bronchiolar disorders in which disease originates and is anatomically limited to small airways and secondary bronchiolar disorders at which disease in large airways or the interstitium extends to involve bronchioles. Multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will allow further refinement of the proposed classification scheme. This review represents the first step toward recognizing and understanding a new clinically important category of respiratory disease in the cat. Future studies targeting early recognition and evaluation of therapeutic strategies for bronchiolar disorders in cats are warranted.",
