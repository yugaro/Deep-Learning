            "text": "Peptidases (proteases or proteinases) are enzymes that hydrolyse the peptide bonds between amino acids in a protein or peptide chain. Hydrolysis of such bonds is required for removal of targeting signals (signal and transit peptides (1), ubiquitin (2), SUMO (3) and NEDD8 (4) peptides), the release of a mature protein from its precursor (5), the switching off of a biological signal by degradation of the signal protein (6), and for widespread catabolism of proteins for recycling of the amino acids. When proteolysis occurs unchecked, then diseases can result, such as Alzheimer's (7), osteoarthritis (8), emphysema (9), tumour invasion (10) and acute pancreatitis (11). Pathogens use peptidases to enter the host and to degrade host proteins for food (12).",

One of the most popular substrates has been the oxidized insulin B-chain, because this is a peptide without tertiary structure, and cleavage depends solely on the preference of the peptidase (13). (The terms \u2018specificity\u2019, \u2018selectivity\u2019 and \u2018preference\u2019 are used interchangeably here.) However, peptidase preference is exactly that: a preference only. Researchers often find that after prolonged exposure to a peptidase other bonds are degraded, albeit slowly, once none of the preferred bonds remain. If the peptidase preparation is not pure, then there is the danger that some of the observed cleavages are due to contaminating peptidases.",

Where cleavage does occur in a protein is due to a combination of the preference of the peptidase and the availability of bonds in the substrate. Although the preference of the peptidase can be quite simple, for example trypsin (MEROPS identifier S01.151) cleaves lysyl and arginyl bonds (15) and caspase-3 (C14.003) cleaves only aspartyl bonds (16), very often peptidase preference is cryptic. It is relatively easy to predict trypsin cleavages in a denatured protein, but few lysyl and arginyl bonds will be cleaved in a native protein. This has proved useful for researchers wishing to separate structural domains in a multidomain protein using limited proteolysis (17). It is not possible to predict where in a peptide cathepsin B (C01.060) will cleave, for example, despite its known preferences for a hydrophobic residue in the S2 pocket and arginine in S1 (18).",

A protein will have few bonds flexible enough to thread into a peptidase active site if the protein is in a native state, because of the stabilizing interactions within and between secondary structure elements within the substrate. It is widely assumed that the susceptible bonds will be within surface loops and interdomain connectors.

Given that nearly all proteins are eventually degraded, and that any one protein can be degraded by several different peptidases often by cleavages at multiple peptide bonds, the potential total number of cleavages will always exceed the number of known proteins. Up until recently each cleavage had to be characterized biochemically, which meant N-terminal sequencing of the products, a time-consuming and labour-intensive task. Now that proteomic analyses are possible, where cell lysates or similar samples are subjected to cleavage by a peptidase, peptides isolated, composition determined by mass spectroscopy, and possible source protein(s) determined from the composition (19), the amount of data is set to rise exponentially. This makes it vitally important that the information be accurately stored and curated. Such a collection made readily available would provide a comprehensive training set for algorithms and software for the prediction of physiological substrates and cleavage positions.",

The collection of known cleavages in substrates which was started in 1998 (22) has now been added to the MEROPS database. For each peptidase there is a page listing known substrates, and, where enough substrates are known, the peptidase summary has displays to show peptidase specificity. For each protein substrate, the sequence is displayed showing where cleavage occurs and which peptidase performs that cleavage. In addition to the MEROPS collection, there is also a collection of physiologically relevant protein cleavages assembled by the CutDB database (23) and more specialist collections of substrates for individual peptidases or peptidase families, such as CASBAH for caspases (24).",

A bespoke program (in Perl) was written to add each cleavage in a protein substrate to ensure consistency; the program connects to the locally installed version of UniProt so that each cleavage position can be confirmed as the data are entered. Some data were acquired from proteomics studies. Again a bespoke program was written to parse the data from the Excel spreadsheets available as Supplementary Data to the published papers.

The number of cleavages in common between the MEROPS and CutDB collections is 5876, of which 3424 were originally found in the literature by the CutDB researchers. The number of cleavages from the CutDB database that failed to make the MEROPS collection, excluding 892 isoforms and 35 duplicates, was 560 (9.5%), mostly due to being mapped to the wrong residue or sequence. The CutDB curators have been informed of these discrepancies. Because the CutDB database includes only cleavages thought to be of physiological relevance and those that can be included in their proteolytic pathways, it has fewer cleavages than in the MEROPS collection.

Where a cleavage site was not conserved, a paralogue was identified in an alignment as a second protein from the same species that was clearly not a splice variant.UniRef50 entries contain many translated genes from genome sequencing projects; gene finding in eukaryote genomes is notoriously difficult and it is possible that erroneous gene building has resulted, for example, in the loss of the exon encoding the cleavage site or the inclusion of part of an intron in its place.It is also probable that for some peptidases there are not enough substrates known to be sure that any amino acid is really excluded from a particular binding site. The number of substrates known for each peptidase is included in Table 4, because the greater the number of substrates the more likely that an amino acid is really atypical and not just unobserved.The alignment is incorrect. This is unlikely given the close relationship between the sequences, which are all 50% or more identical; however there are situations where an insert or deletion occurs within the range P4\u2013P4\u2032.Some endogenous cleavages (for example removal of signal and transit peptides) may be the result of more than one cleavage, because aminopeptidases nibble away the N-terminus (1), and may thus be incorrectly mapped to the specificity of the leader peptidase.It is theoretically possible that if the substrate and peptidase are from the same organism both will have evolved to accommodate a change in the cleavage position.A single residue mismatch may also be due to a single-base sequencing error. Potential errors of this kind can be identified using a codon dictionary, provided the atypical residue could be the result of a single base change, and that it is the only residue not conserved, regardless of the number of sequences in the alignment.Some cleavages regarded as \u2018physiological\u2019 are actually fortuitous. If a cleavage site is extremely poorly conserved it is unlikely to be physiologically relevant.\n",

There are N-terminal extensions to most homologues so that the known methionyl aminopeptidase 2-cleavage site is not aligned. Five of these sequences may be derived from erroneous gene builds (point b). The UniRef50 database entry for 60S ribosomal protein L10 (P27635) includes a wide range of species (the cleavage is known in the human protein) and the peptidase performing the cleavage (granzyme B) is not present in Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, where the substrate cleavage is also not conserved. The replacements that are reported as atypical in hemoglobin subunit alpha (P69905) by Schistosoma cathepsin D (A01.009) (34) are the rarest naturally occurring amino acids, tryptophan and cysteine, and despite there being 109 known cleavages for this peptidase, this may still not be enough to properly exclude these rare amino acids. On the other hand, this is the cleavage of a host protein by a parasite peptidase and the specificity may have adapted to limit the availability of hosts.",

For example, despite there being few cleavages for cathepsin H, the reported cleavages in the BID protein (36) are in particularly poorly conserved regions (see Figure 3). Cleavage of the BID protein leads to the induction of apoptosis. That the cleavage sites are not well conserved amongst mammalian orthologues is not surprising given that the cytoplasmic substrate and the lysosomal peptidase should not meet under normal circumstances. The mouse protein in which the cleavage was identified may therefore be unusually susceptible to cleavage should the lysosomal membrane be ruptured.",
