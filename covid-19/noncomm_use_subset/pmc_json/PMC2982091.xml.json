            "text": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped virus with a positive single strand RNA genome, which has emerged in the human population during winter 2002\u20132003 causing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infections with a 10% mortality rate (Peiris et al., 2004). The reasons for the severity of illness in SARS-CoV infected patients are still not clearly understood. The SARS-CoV mainly targets epithelial cells, the respiratory tract being the primary site of infection (Nicholls et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2006). One of the major pathological features of SARS-CoV infection is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) of the human lung, more prominent in the terminal stage, with occasional extensive damage of the lung epithelium (Kuiken et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003). Several hypotheses have been made to explain DAD, invoking either intrinsic cytopathic effect of the virus or dysfunction of the immune system (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Perlman and Netland, 2009; Yoshikawa et al., 2009). Another clinical feature is the extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus with other organ dysfunction including lymphoid tissues, liver, intestine, and kidney (Farcas et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2005). One possibility is that viral proteins disrupt mucosal integrity by interfering with the regulation and maintenance of specialized epithelial functions, such as intercellular junctions and apicobasal polarity and, as a consequence, induce viral dissemination. In this line, recent studies using a recombinant virus lacking the SARS-Cov E gene suggest that E envelope protein is a virulence factor influencing replication level, virus dissemination, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV in animal models (DeDiego et al., 2007; DeDiego et al., 2008). However, the molecular mechanism involving E in pathogenesis is not known. Interestingly, in vitro studies on monolayers of human airway epithelial cells have shown that morphology of cells was affected at late time points following infection (72 and 120 h) and suggested that cellular junctions and polarity were altered (Sims et al., 2005).",

The CRB complex consists of CRUMBS3 (CRB3), PALS1, and PATJ (Roh et al., 2002; Hurd et al., 2003; Roh et al., 2003). PALS1 (Protein Associated with Caenorhabditis elegans Lin-7 protein 1) belongs to the group of PDZ (Post-synaptic density protein-95/Discs Large/Zonula occludens-1) domain-containing proteins that function as scaffolds for signaling proteins and are involved in diverse cellular functions (reviewed in Schneeberger and Lynch, 2004; Miyoshi and Takai, 2005; Shin et al., 2006; Wang and Margolis, 2007). PALS1 is the central component of the CRB complex and is the ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster Stardust, key regulator of cellular polarity during embryogenesis (Kamberov et al., 2000). It is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family and is also known as MPP5 (membrane protein, palmitoylated 5) in humans. PALS1 contains 675 amino acids organized in the following functional domains: two L27 motifs, one PDZ, one SH3 (Src Homology 3), one band 4.1, and one Guk (Guanylate kinase) domains (Kamberov et al., 2000).",

CRB3, ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells, docks the CRB complex at the apical domain of the plasma membrane where it is specifically anchored (Makarova et al., 2003). PALS1 PDZ domain binds to CRB3 carboxy-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM), which consists of four terminal amino acids, E-R-L-I (Roh et al., 2002; Hurd et al., 2003; Roh et al., 2003). In MDCKII cells, knockdown of PALS1 expression by small interfering RNA leads to concurrent loss of expression of PATJ, decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and disruption of cell polarity, as illustrated by formation of cysts with multiple lumens when MDCKII are grown in a collagen gel matrix (Straight et al., 2004). Wang and coworkers have further demonstrated that depletion of PALS1 in MDCKII cells alters the intracellular trafficking of E-cadherin, which is retained as intracellular puncta at the cell periphery and is not effectively delivered to the cell surface. As a result, both TJ and adherens junction (AJ) formation are disrupted (Wang et al., 2007). In summary, PALS1 functionally regulates and maintains the integrity of TJ and AJ, and as a consequence cell polarity in epithelial cells.",

Here we show that the CT of the SARS-CoV envelope protein E binds the human TJ protein PALS1 in human epithelial cells. E is a small hydrophobic integral membrane protein of 76 amino acid residues, which plays a major but not fully understood role in virus morphogenesis and budding (Liu et al., 2007; Siu et al., 2008). In transfected and infected cells, it is known that E localizes at the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi apparatus, where virus assembly occurs (Nal et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Siu et al., 2008). In this report we study the biochemical interaction between SARS-CoV E and human PALS1 and investigate the consequences of E expression in MDCKII epithelial cells on cyst morphogenesis and tight junction formation. We propose a model which places E as a virulent factor that hijacks the TJ-associated protein PALS1, causing severe damage to the epithelial barrier. Our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to SARS-CoV-induced pathogenesis in infected epithelia.",

In brief, the cDNA coding for the CT domain of SARS-CoV E was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pB27 vector enabling fusion with the LexA binding domain. The bait construct was checked by sequencing the entire insert and was subsequently introduced into the L40\u0394GAL4 yeast strain (Fromont-Racine et al., 1997). A random-primed human placenta cDNA library that consists of ten million independent fragments was transformed into the Y187 yeast strain, and both strains were allowed to mate. In the screening, 70 millions interactions were tested with E CT. After selection on medium lacking leucine, tryptophane, and histidine, 146 positive clones were picked, and the corresponding prey fragments were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal ends. Sequences were then filtered and contiged as described previously (Formstecher et al., 2005) and compared with the latest release of the GenBank database using BLASTN. A Predicted Biological Score (PBS) was attributed to assess the reliability of each interaction, as described earlier (Rain et al., 2001; Formstecher et al., 2005).",

Five microliters of each purified GST fusion protein were run on 4\u201312% acrylamide SDS-PAGE in parallel to serial dilution of bovine serum albumin of known concentration (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue, and the protein concentration, ranging between 0.08\u20130.40 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, was estimated in comparison to the band intensity of the BSA control. The purified GST fusion proteins were stored at 4\u00b0C for further usage.",

We found that its four carboxy-terminal amino acids (D-L-L-V) share a high degree of similarity with the carboxy-terminal PBM of CRB1 and 3 (E-R-L-I), the natural ligands of PALS1 PDZ domain. Indeed both sequences start with an acidic amino acid and end with two hydrophobic residues ([E,D]-X-\u03a6-\u03a6).

As negative control, the cells were mock-transfected and individually transfected with these plasmids (Figure 4B, panels a and b). All proteins were expressed in transfected cells, although we observed that Flag-PALS1 protein levels were slightly lower in cells coexpressing HA E (wt) (Figure 4B, panel a, compare lanes 4, 5, and 6). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Flag M2 agarose resin and analyzed by immunoblotting. Membranes were hybridized with either the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 HRP-conjugated or anti-HA tag antibody. As expected, the HA-E (wt) protein was efficiently coprecipitated with Flag-PALS1 (Figure 4B, panels c and d, lane 5). In contrast, only trace amounts of HA-E (\u0394PBM) mutant protein were coimmunoprecipitated by Flag-PALS1 (Figure 4B, panels c and d, lane 6). The binding ability of SARS-E protein to PALS1 was reduced by \u223c85% by deleting the putative PBM formed by the last four amino acids of the CT tail. Neither HA-E (wt) nor HA-E (\u0394PBM) mutant protein was coimmunoprecipitated from the negative control cell lysates (Figure 4B, panels c and d, lanes 2\u20133). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that the D-L-L-V motif is a PDZ domain-binding motif, which mediates E binding to the PALS1 PDZ domain, both in vitro and in vivo.

MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 control cells could rapidly form TJ (Figure 6), as indicated by a maximum TER value of \u223c400 \u03a9/cm2 reached at 2 h post-calcium switch in the experiment shown. A similar time course of TJ formation was also recorded with MDCKII cells expressing eGFP-PALS1 together with HcRed fluorescent proteins (data not shown). At later time points, TJ were gradually loosing strength, with lower TER values of 100 \u03a9/cm2 measured after 17 h post-calcium switch, as previously reported in two different studies (Straight et al., 2004; Latorre et al., 2005). Interestingly, ectopic expression of HA-E protein led to a significant delay in TJ formation, which started only 4 h post-calcium switch, with TER values gradually raising to attain a maximum of 700 \u03a9/cm2 recorded at 17 h post-calcium switch (Figure 6). Conversely, monolayer cells of the MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 expressing HA-E (\u0394PBM) reached maximum TER 2 h post-calcium switch with a maximum of 700 \u03a9/cm2 (Figure 6). Interestingly, two opposite effects were observed for cells expressing E (wt) and E (\u0394PBM) when compared with control cells. Whereas E (wt) expressing cells presented a significant delay in establishment of TER, E (\u0394PBM) cells could reach higher TER values more rapidly than control cells. These data suggest that both expression of E (wt) and E (\u0394PBM) affect the kinetics of TJ formation and that the DLLV C-terminal motif of E is responsible for the delay in TJ establishment in MDCKII epithelial cells. A similar pattern was observed for clones of MDCKII cells expressing E (wt) or E (\u0394PBM) on an endogenous PALS1 background (Supplemental Figure 4).",

Relative localization of eGFP-PALS1 was also analyzed. Confocal microscopy and Z-sectioning allowed three-dimensional analysis of samples and monitoring of TJ formation and polarity establishment. At 2 h post-calcium switch, MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 cells had formed a regular monolayer of cubical cells (Figure 7A, panels a and b). In these cells, eGFP-PALS1 was present at cell\u2013cell contacts in apical regions where it colocalized with ZO-1. Analysis of XZ and YZ dimensions showed that both proteins were present at TJ (Figure 7A, panel b, black arrowheads). The GP135 marker was found on apical surface of the cells (Figure 7A, panel a), whereas the E-cadherin protein was present at cell\u2013cell junctions on lateral membranes, underneath eGFP-PALS1 and ZO-1, delineating AJ (Figure 7A, panels a and b).

At 8 and 24 h, although TER values of both cell lines were similar (400\u2013500 and 100\u2013120 \u03a9/cm2, respectively), differences could be observed.

At 24 h, cells were in contact with each others. At this time, more round cells with higher expression of E (wt) and cytoplasmic localization of PALS1 were seen (Figure 8B, panel e, red arrow).

Moreover, we have demonstrated that E possesses a novel PBM motif at its carboxy-terminal tail, which mediates binding of E to PALS1 PDZ domain (Figure 4, A and B), and that a CT peptide of E but not E (\u0394PBM) competes against CRB3 interaction with the PDZ domain of PALS1 in vitro (Figure 4C and data not shown).

These viral PBM bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins involved in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity and induced epithelial-to-mesenchyme transformation in a PBM\u2013dependent manner (reviewed in Javier, 2008; Liu and Baleja, 2008; Thomas et al., 2008; Tungteakkhun et al., 2008; Wise-Draper and Wells, 2008; Tomaic et al., 2009).

We argue that in these cells, PALS1 trafficking is altered through mis-targeting to/or retention at the ERGIC/Golgi site. Conversely, the tight junction protein ZO-1 was maintained at cell\u2013cell contact domains in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells, indicating the specificity of PALS1 mislocation. Additionally, in Vero E6 cells transiently expressing EYFP-PALS1 and E, we observed that these proteins also colocalized in the perinuclear region (Supplemental Figure S1). Interestingly, we observed that morphogenesis of MDCKII cysts is significantly disrupted when E is expressed (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S3). However, polarity was not affected at the time of analysis, as indicated by the apical distribution of GP135, ZO-1, PALS1, and CRB3 (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S3). Strikingly, similar findings were observed when E (\u0394PBM) was expressed, but not a control HcRed protein (data not shown). Correct tissue morphogenesis is a very sensitive marker, which depends on intact polarity (Schl\u00fcter and Margolis, 2009) but also on cdc42-dependent spindle morphology (Jaffe et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2010) independently from tight junction formation. It is possible that E interacts with a cellular pathway that regulates cyst morphogenesis, independently of its PBM. It is reasonable to postulate that E contains more than one region that interacts with host cell factors. It is indeed well known that pathogens usually develop several strategies to ensure their optimal adaptation/interaction/virulence within the host cell environment.",

            "text": "Our data also showed that expression of E (wt), but not E (\u0394PBM), delayed TJ formation in MDCKII cells in calcium switch assays (Figure 6). This is well illustrated by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis of these cells (Figures 7 and 8). Indeed, two hours post-calcium switch, E (wt) expressing cells present a strong defect of polarity with a mis-location of polarity markers, whereas control cells and E (\u0394PBM) expressing cells are polarized, with TJ (ZO-1, PALS1), AJ (E-cadherin) and apical (GP135) markers correctly localized. These data indicate that E expression alters TJ formation in a PBM-dependent manner, and affects establishment of polarity. A significant number of E (wt) expressing cells were round with presence of PALS1 in the cytoplasm, occasionally found associated with E in the Golgi region. This was generally observed for cells with higher expression levels of E. However, TJ could form, although with a delay of several hours, suggesting that the kinetics of trafficking of PALS1 was affected but not the process of TJ formation. At 120 h post-calcium switch, PALS1 was present at cell\u2013cell contacts for both E (wt) and E (\u0394PBM) expressing cells, witch are most likely back to a steady state with low TER values, common for this MDCKII cell line (Figure 8, panels g and h). However, round cells were still present in E (wt) expressing cells. Conversely, E (\u0394PBM) expressing cells showed enhanced TER values, which indicated a rapid formation of junctions. E (\u0394PBM) was not present in the Golgi region but was rather diffuse in the apical region of the cytosol. PALS1 was not mislocalized and did not colocalize with this truncated form of E. Therefore, we conclude that SARS-CoV E alters PALS1 distribution in monolayers of MDCKII cells and, as a consequence, disturbs TJ and polarity in a PBM-dependent manner.",

However, a molecular mechanism that contributes to the destruction of the alveolar walls remains unclear. Several studies have revealed that human airway epithelial cells produce chemokines and cytokines that contribute to the massive recruitment of leukocytes at the site of infection and strongly suggest that inflammation of the lung contributes to DAD (reviewed in Lau and Peiris, 2005; Thiel and Weber, 2008). Similarly, mechanisms leading to dysfunction of other organs, such as the kidney, at late times of infection, are unknown.",

We have verified that PALS1 and CRB3 are expressed in pneumocytes in immunohistochemistry experiments on post mortem lung biopsies (Kim Tat Teoh and John Nicholls, the University of Hong Kong). We hypothesize that E binds to PALS1 and alters its localization in infected cells in vivo. Loss of PALS1 at TJ could cause TJ and AJ disruption and contribute to the desquamation of the alveolar wall, as observed in lung biopsies from SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques and patients (Nicholls et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005). We propose that alteration of TJ and AJ would create a breach in the epithelial barrier allowing virions to reach the basal matrix and eventually the systemic circulation to disseminate to distant organs (Figure 9B, panel b).",

(B) A scheme illustrating a working model of sequential events that occur during SARS-CoV infection in alveolar epithelial cells. (a) Infection of alveolar epithelial cells by incoming viruses. The SARS-CoV virions attach to ACE2 receptors, which are localized at the apical surface. Virions are internalized into endosomes where the acidic pH triggers envelope fusion. The viral RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm and is transcribed to a set of subgenomic (sgmRNA) strands that encode for structural proteins S, M, N, E, and other accessory proteins. S, M, N, and E accumulate in the ERGIC compartment where virions assemble. At this stage, SARS-E could bind to PALS1 and disrupt its trafficking to TJ. (b) Disruption of TJ and virus dissemination. Loss of PALS1 at TJ results in a progressive disruption of TJ, which leads to leakage between adjacent epithelial cells, loss of barrier function, and infiltration of SARS-CoV virions into underlying tissues. Eventually, viruses reach the systemic circulation and disseminate to distant organs. Hijacking of PALS1 by SARS-E in infected pneumocytes may explain the severe alveolar damages observed in post-mortem lung biopsies from SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients.",
