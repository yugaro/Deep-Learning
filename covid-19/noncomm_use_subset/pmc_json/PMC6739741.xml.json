There was no\ninformation about the pelvic limb reflexes; however, the cat had started to have\noccasional urinary and fecal incontinence. Appetite seemed normal; however, the cat\nremained thin. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C),\nheart rate of 170 beats per min and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per min. BCS was\n3/9; however, the weight was not noted. Abdominal palpation revealed a large, easily\nexpressible urinary bladder. Neurologic examination findings revealed normal\nmentation with no involuntary movements such as tremors. The cat was still very\nataxic and ambulatory but now tetraparetic, which was much worse in the pelvic\nlimbs. There was no information about cranial nerve abnormalities, and the eyes and\nretinas were within normal limits. From a video provided by the owner (see supplementary material), tail paresis was identified. The lesion was\nconsidered to affect the CNS and was localized as multifocal.

The R793M mutation\nin the spike protein S1/S2 cleavage-activation site is a major chemical change from\na basic to a hydrophobic residue, and is consistent with an elimination of\nfurin-mediated proteolytic processing of the S protein, as seen by Licitra et al,17 and a proposed change in the activation properties and entry pathway of the\nvirus. It is interesting to note that the R793M mutation was not present in other\ntissues tested in this cat at the time of necropsy but was found in our previous\nstudy (cat ID #08-153990),17 where samples were of neural origin. While biological confirmation is not\navailable, we consider that the other changes found in the viral spike protein from\ncentral nervous tissue of this cat (A770V and T786A) are not related to changes in\nthe activation properties and entry pathway of the virus, as they are not in defined\nfunctional regions of the spike protein and are not markedly different in their\nchemistry. Interestingly, all samples tested from this cat contained a distinct\nleucine residue at position 791 (the P3 position of the furin cleavage site,\ntypically serine or alanine as defined in Licitra et al).17 The relevance of this is currently unclear. Overall, our results provide\nevidence that mutation of the viral spike protein is linked to FIP outcome,\nspecifically in the S1/S2 cleavage-activation site (residues 789\u2013794).",
