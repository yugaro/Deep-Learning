Claiming numerous safety precautions in his biosafety level 3 (BSL3+) laboratory, Fouchier calculates P1 = 1 \u00d7 10\u20137 per person per year, and since there are 10 workers with access to his laboratory, P1 = 1 \u00d7 10\u20136 per lab per year. Compare this to P1 = 2 \u00d7 10\u20133 per lab per year for BSL3 laboratories calculated from CDC statistics for undetected or unreported LAIs (2, 3), here called \u201ccommunity LAIs,\u201d as it is assumed that an undetected or unreported LAI represents an infection that has traveled outside the lab and into the community.",
