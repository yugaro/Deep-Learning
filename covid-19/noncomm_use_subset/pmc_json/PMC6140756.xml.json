The results show that the majority of patients with asthma had several viral pathogens, which contributed to symptoms and airway resistance (Tables 1 and 2). The clinical impact of the respiratory pathogens on asthma control is shown in Table 1. Patients 2 and 3 had increased CCQ scores in association with colonizations with HI and BP on the second sampling. The increased airway resistance in Patient 5 on the second sample collection could be due to colonization with HI or adverse events of prior AdV. Similarly, the increased airway resistance in Patient 8 could be due to prior CoV OC43. The high airway resistance in Patient 14 could be due to PIV-3. As the course and severity of asthma are also related to the role of many environmental factors (such as air pollution, humidity, and smoking), medication adherence, and poor inhaler technique, it is not totally unexpected that the role of respiratory pathogens cannot be considered in isolation and cannot be solely responsible for asthma control. With respect to the controls (Table 3), Children 1 and 6 both had high airway resistance associated with multiple colonizations. Child 1 was found subsequently to have symptoms of allergic rhinitis and mild night cough.",

Specific measures that have been suggested to minimize recurrent infections in children with asthma include hand hygiene, a healthy balanced diet, active probiotic supplements, and the immunostimulant OM-85.22 Further studies, however, are needed to investigate whether reducing exposure to pathogens would improve asthma control. In addition, the role of other environmental factors (such as air pollution, humidity, and smoking), medication adherence, and poor inhaler technique has to be taken into consideration in future studies.",

Regular surveillance could play a role in asthma care, especially in those with poorly controlled disease. Effective strategies to minimize exposure to respiratory pathogens, such as hand hygiene should be incorporated in childhood asthma guidelines. Such approach would emphasize the importance of environmental control measures rather than relying solely on escalating asthma drug therapy with its potential toxicity. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether strategies that minimize children\u2019s exposure to pathogens would improve asthma control.",
