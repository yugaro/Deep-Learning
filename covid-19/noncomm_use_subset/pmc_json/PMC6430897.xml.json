There is a close parallelism between these forms of equine disease and human asthma.1, 2\n",

Other more thermotolerant fungi can grow at both environmental and body temperatures and thus act as both aeroallergens and opportunistic pathogens (Candida, Penicillium, and Aspergillus). When infective, they can further damage their host by producing toxins. Aspergillus species are the most prominent cause of fungal lung infections in humans.7\n",

The inhalation of a combination of molds and endotoxin exacerbates RAO signs, including loss of respiratory function in experimental models.19 The involvement of fungi in the pathogenesis of IAD remains unclear. As in RAO, exposure to inhaled dust and allergens could play a critical role in the development of the disease.20, 21 The association of various dust components found in stable air with IAD has been investigated and includes organic dust, endotoxin, and ammonia,22, 23 but no link has been made between IAD and exposure to fungal particles.",

These findings support the role that aerosolized fungal elements play in the pathophysiology of IAD, as it is the case in RAO. Fungi can be allergenic, infective, toxic, or any combination of the above. The role of fungi in equine IAD needs to be further investigated. Although fungi might not necessarily be the primary cause of IAD, it is possible that deficits in immunity might modify the equine ability to react to infection. In humans, in addition to asthma or invasive fungal pneumonia, other more moderate fungal infections have been described, such as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, aspergillus bronchitis, ABPA, and severe asthma with fungal sensitization. The results of our study suggest that this category of intermediate pathological fungal conditions also exists in the airways of horses as well. The identification of proliferating fungi in the airways is a sign of fungal infection and warrants further investigation.",

This raises the question about a possible link between bacterial and fungal infections. In people, airway inflammation leading to decreased mucus clearance can lead to environmental bacteria getting trapped within the mucus and not being eliminated normally which promotes infection.34 The same could be true for fungi. In people, fungi like Aspergillus are suspected to decrease the local immune response and mucus clearance via the secretion of mycotoxins like gliotoxin35, 36 and verruculogen.37 These mycotoxins have shown to damage human epithelial cells and modify the electrophysiological properties of human or porcine epithelial cells in vitro.37\n",

Thus, mycology was not a sensitive method to detect horses with a more severe fungal condition. Although no relationship could be established between fungal growth and a diagnosis of IAD, horses with developing hyphae in their airways should be cautiously evaluated as it has been shown that most fungal allergens are released after spores germinate.38 In people, routine fungal culture methods underestimate the presence of fungi in respiratory samples.39 When comparing the cytological detection of fungal elements with fungal culture in respiratory samples of patients who died of pulmonary aspergillosis, cytology was found to have superior sensitivity and specificity, using postmortem as the gold standard reference.40 In the context of a diagnosis of IAD, the authors recommend that both cytology and mycology be performed on the TW. Identification of fungal elements in the TW was far more frequent than in the BAL. Although not useful for the diagnosis of IAD in itself, a cytological examination of the TW might be a good way to evaluate exposure of the horse to fungal particles in this environment.",

However, cough and nasal discharge were more prevalent in horses with IAD or with a positive TW mycology. Exercise intolerance was also significantly more prevalent in horses with a positive TW mycology. None of the horses showed the severe clinical signs typically described in the cases of fungal pneumonia (depression, deep cough, fever, anorexia, and weight loss).44 Thus, it is not possible to rely solely on clinical signs to diagnose IAD and the presence of fungal particles in the airways.

Their use cannot be recommended in performance horses. Fungal spores naturally contaminate hay and straw during harvest.45, 46 The storage of hay and straw can also lead to an exponential increase in fungal proliferation within the batches. The degree of contamination and proliferation is directly related to harvesting practices, initial levels of soil contamination, as well as storage conditions. On the contrary, wood shavings decreased the risk of IAD and the detection of fungal particles in the airways. This bedding type seems to be an appropriate solution to maintain equine respiratory health. The use of high\u2010temperature hay steaming also had a significantly protective effect against the development of IAD and the contamination of airways with fungal particles in our study. Hay steaming has been shown to significantly reduce bacterial as well as fungal contamination47 and could be an effective means to improve the hygiene of forage. Interestingly, soaking the hay, which is often recommended as a protective measure for horses with respiratory inflammation, did not significantly decrease the risk of being IAD nor the risk of having fungal elements in the airways. Similarly, the use of haylage did not reduce the risk of IAD in our study. The absence of a significantly preventative effect of haylage could be attributable to its use in a limited number of horses and the large variation in the quality of haylage products used. Similarly, hay commercialized as \u201cdust\u2010free\u201d hay was not a good alternative in our study as it did not reduce the risk of IAD nor the risk of finding fungal particles in the airways.",
