            "text": "STING is activated by several distinct mechanisms. For detailed information on the mechanisms of STING activation in response to DNA PAMPs, the reader is directed to two recent reviews by Unterholzner, and Ran et al. [6], [7]. Fig. 1 summarises the mechanisms by which RNA virus infection is thought to activate STING. While STING has been shown to directly bind DNA, it does not interact with the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) [19], suggesting that STING itself does not function as a PRR for the recognition of RNA virus PAMPs. However, STING has been shown to function as an adapter in the sensing of RNA viruses via RIG-I [reviewed in 7]. STING interacts with RIG-I, but not MDA-5, and consequently STING is activated by ligands that bind RIG-I, but not those detected by MDA-5 [3], [4], [7]. MDA-5 senses long dsRNA molecules, while RIG-I senses shorter dsRNA elements and the uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphate of exogenous RNAs [reviewed in 20]. STING can also be activated through the exogenous expression of a C-terminally truncated RIG-I construct (\u0394RIG-I) that is constitutively active because it encodes only the N-terminal CARD signalling domains of RIG-I [3], [21]. Ultimately this results in STING participating in immune responses mounted against RNA viruses sensed by RIG-I, including Sendai virus (SeV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not those sensed exclusively by MDA-5 [7]. Following activation via RIG-I, STING interacts with the adapter protein MAVS at the MAM or mitochondria, and after its translocation to perinuclear vesicles, STING then acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of TBK1 and other signalling components required for IRF-3 activation and type I IFN induction [3], [4], [7], [8]. This role in modulating RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses is likely one of the major ways in which STING contributes to immune sensing of RNA viruses. However, several recent reports suggest that there may be additional RIG-I-independent ways by which STING helps sense RNA virus infection [22], [23], [24].",

            "text": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a recently-discovered cytosolic PRR that detects double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and produces the signalling molecule cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds and activates STING during DNA virus infection [6], [7]. Interestingly, in a recent screen for the antiviral activity of known ISGs, Schoggins et al. identified cGAS as one of the most potent restriction factors for all positive-sense RNA viruses tested [22], [23]. The antiviral effects of cGAS were still evident in the absence of RIG-I [23]. Importantly, mortality and virus replication were increased in cGAS knock-out mice infected with the positive-sense RNA virus West Nile virus (WNV) [22]. Whether cGAS acts as a bona fide RNA sensor remains controversial. While, cGAS does not bind poly(I:C) in vitro\n[6], [7], [25], a recent report showed that cGAS was able to bind a synthetic 50mer dsRNA, although this did not result on the generation of cGAMP [26]. Since cGAMP is required for cGAS-mediated STING activation [6], [7], [25], it remains somewhat mysterious how cGAS contributes to RNA virus sensing. Schoggins et al. proposed that, because basal expression levels were reduced for a subset of ISGs in the absence of cGAS, cGAS might modulate the overall refractoriness of cells to RNA viruses [22]. Nevertheless, negative-sense RNA viruses are not restricted by cGAS [22], and this exquisite specificity of cGAS for positive-sense RNA viruses suggests that cGAS might be directly involved in sensing positive-sense RNA virus infection.",

Direct evidence that such membrane modifications activate STING and/or cGAS is lacking. However, STING signalling has been shown to be induced by fusion events at the plasma membrane [24]. Both cationic liposomes and herpesvirus-derived virus-like particles that lack nucleic acids were shown to cause the relocalisation of STING to TBK1-containing perinuclear vesicles, as well as the induction of cytokines in a manner that was dependent upon STING, TBK1 and IRF-3 [24]. This activation of STING did not require the RIG-I signalling pathway [24]. Instead, the fusion-mediated activation of STING involved an as-yet poorly-characterised mechanism involving phospholipase C-\u03b3 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) [24]. Therefore, membrane-remodelling events during viral entry or later on in the viral life cycle may also be sensed by STING to induce STING activation. It is interesting to speculate that STING might also sense other disruptions to the normal cellular equilibrium, such as the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm or mitochondrial dysregulation during infection with certain viruses.",

DENV is arguable the most significant arboviral pathogen of humans with up to 2.5 billion people at risk of infection in the tropics and subtropics, and an estimated 50 million cases of dengue fever and the more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever annually, resulting in over 20,000 deaths [29], [30], [32], [33]. The ways in which DENV evades STING signalling is of particular interest because the dysregulated production of cytokines and chemokines during DENV infection is known to contribute to symptoms associated with severe dengue disease [29], [34]. Furthermore, developing a DENV vaccine has so far proven challenging [35], [36], and understanding how DENV modulates the immune response may lead to improved vaccine strategies.",

Type I IFN is also poorly induced in DENV-infected plasmacytoid and blood-circulating DCs, B cells, monocytes and in whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [9].

Specifically, we demonstrated that the NS2B/3 protease complex inhibited activation of a luciferase reporter controlled by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in 293T cells stimulated with poly(I:C) or after infection with SeV [39]. We verified these findings by measuring endogenous IFN-\u03b1 production in MDDCs infected with an NDV mutant expressing the DENV NS2B/3 protein. This NDV virus exhibited impaired IFN-\u03b1 induction relative to its parental wild-type (wt) [39]. Yu et al. later showed that NS2B/3 inhibits type I IFN induction above the level of IRF-3 phosphorylation [12], which we had also observed during DENV infection in MDDCs [39]. In addition to its protease activity, NS3 by itself also functions as a helicase, NTPase and 5\u2032 triphosphatase during viral RNA replication [29]. We were able to distinguish between these diverse functions of NS3 by showing that a construct encoding a truncated NS3 containing only its proteolytic core, as well as the minimal NS2B accessory region, was just as efficient at inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation as wt NS2B/3 [39]. Importantly, we also confirmed that a proteolytically-inactive NS2B/3 mutant harbouring a serine-to-alanine mutation at position 135 (S135A) did not inhibit type I IFN induction [39].",

Furthermore, wt NS2B/3 expressed exogenously or in the context of DENV infection rapidly degraded endogenous and over-expressed STING, by 24 h post-infection (hpi) in tissue culture and in MDDCs infected at high multiplicity with DENV [9], [12]. Catalytically inactive NS2B/3 did not degrade STING [9], [12]. The Lin group also reported that STING and NS2B/3 colocalise when over-expressed in A549 cells, and that STING-NS2B/3 binding, colocalisation and cleavage is enhanced when STING signalling is stimulated with a dsDNA PAMP such as poly(dA:dT) [12]. It is known that exogenous over-expression of STING activates type I IFN production [3], and this induction was inhibited in the presence of the wt, but not catalytically inactive, DENV protease [9], [12]. In combination, these findings demonstrate that NS2B/3 binds and degrades STING to inhibit IFN induction, and that this function requires NS2B/3's protease activity. Importantly, although there are four antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to -4), these observations were not limited to any particular serotype as STING degradation was observed during infection with DENV-1 and several different DENV-2 strains [9], [12].",

In contrast to full-length STING, neither of the truncation mutants were functional in a reporter assay that measures the ability of over-expressed STING to induce type I IFN [12], confirming that cleavage of STING by the DENV protease disrupts STING functionality as an adaptor for type I IFN induction.",

Consequently, while NS2B/3 is able to interact with both human and murine STING in over-expression experiments, only hSTING is cleaved by the DENV protease [9], [12]. When the NS2B/3 cleavage site in hSTING is replaced with its murine counterpart, the DENV protease loses its ability to degrade hSTING and inhibit STING function [9], [12]. In the reciprocal experiment, introducing the cleavage site of hSTING into mSTING does not make mSTING susceptible to the action of the DENV protease [9], [12], suggesting that additional distal sequences within STING are required for STING cleavage by NS2B/3. These observations were initially made in over-expression experiments in 293T and A549 cells (both human cell lines) in which luciferase reporter activity or endogenous IRF-3 phosphorylation was induced by STING over-expression [9], [12]. We further verified these findings in a more biologically-relevant context by using Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-based protein expression vectors to infect human MDDCs and murine bone marrow-derived DCs [9]. In this experiment, SFV expressing the catalytically inactive S135A protease mutant induced type I IFN to a higher degree than SFV expressing wt NS2B/3 in human MDDCs, while similar levels of IFN induction were observed with both SFV constructs in murine DCs [9]. Furthermore, when we introduced wt hSTING and the uncleavable hSTING mutant containing the murine sequence into human MDDCs by lentivirus transduction we observed more pronounced IFN-\u03b2 induction during DENV infection, and a concomitant reduction in viral RNA levels, with the uncleavable hSTING mutant [9].",

This restriction is thought to arise due to species-specific differences in immunological restriction factors [43], and potentially also in virus\u2013host interactions required for viral entry into cells [44]. We and others have proposed that an immunocompetent mouse model for DENV could be developed by humanising mice through the replacement of key immunological restriction factors with their human counterparts [9], [12], [43]. Regarding the potential utility of STING in such transgenic mice, we observed enhanced levels of DENV replication in Sting\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to Sting\n+/+ (wt) MEFs using human strains from DENV serotypes 2, 3 and 4, as well as the mouse-adapted strain New Guinea C [9]. Relative to human cells, we consistently observe a more robust induction of type I IFN during DENV infection in wt MEFs and murine bone marrow-derived DCs due to the inability of the DENV protease to antagonise mSTING, and importantly IFN-\u03b2 levels during DENV infection were reduced in Sting\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs in comparison to Sting\n+/+ MEFs [9]. Taken together, these data confirm the importance of STING signalling for the induction of type I IFN during DENV infection, as well as identifying STING as one of the species-specific DENV restriction factors in mice.",

This is because wt hSTING, but not the uncleavable mutant, is rendered non-functional by the DENV NS2B/3 protease. These promising preliminary observations suggest that transgenic mice expressing hSTING in place of mSTING might be productively infected with non-mouse-adapted DENV strains (more relevant to human clinical infection), while retaining their ability to mount a more authentic immune response than current mouse models for DENV, which are more immunocompromised. In reality it would likely be beneficial to engineer such transgenic (knock-in) mice to also express human version of other known immunological restriction factors, such as STAT2 [43].

This becomes of interest when considering the potential conservation of NS2B/3's alternative function as a STING antagonist. In fact, the Lin group did not observe STING cleavage during JEV infection or when JEV NS2B/3 was over-expressed in isolation [12]. Furthermore, we were unable to detect STING cleavage with the YFV NS2B/3 (unpublished observations), although it should be noted that we have only tested the YFV vaccine strain 17D and it is possible that part of the attenuation in this virus is due to an altered ability of the protease to antagonise STING. Nevertheless, YFV is known to antagonise STING's ability to induce type I IFN with its NS4B protein, which binds and colocalises with STING in transient transfection experiments [8]. Further mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, we did not observe an inhibition of type I IFN induction with the DENV-2 NS4B protein using various stimuli in human MDDCs and in 293T cells [39]. However, we did not test STING-specific stimuli in our assays. It is nevertheless interesting to postulate that DENV and YFV have evolved distinct mechanisms to antagonise STING because the different cleavage specificities of their proteases prohibit the YFV protease from degrading STING. It is surprising then that JEV does not cleave STING, especially considering that STING has been shown to be important for orchestrating the innate immune response to JEV in neuronal cells [47]. However, we cannot rule out that JEV has evolved different mechanisms for blocking STING signalling, either upstream or downstream of STING itself, or that the observations made by Yu et al. are virus strain-specific.",

It would be highly interesting to perform a systematic comparison of STING antagonism (and the diversity of mechanisms underlying it) across the Flavivirus genus in the diverse vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors infected by these viruses. Understanding the functions of invertebrate STING is of particular interest because how arboviruses are sensed, and how they might counteract inducible immune responses, remains poorly understood in the vector. These virus-vector immune interactions likely have a large impact on arbovirus transmission, and understanding them better may lead to new strategies for blocking arbovirus transmission.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belongs to the Hepacivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family, and is only distantly related to the flaviviruses discussed so far [28]. World-wide, an estimated 170 million people are chronically infected with HCV, with 3\u20134 million new infections and more than 350,000 deaths annually [51], [52]. HCV is a blood-borne virus that primarily infects hepatocytes [53]. The virus becomes persistent in 60\u201380% of patients, eventually causing progressive liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma [51], [53], [54]. There is currently no licensed vaccine for HCV [55]. Up until recently, HCV infection was treated primarily with a combination of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin, with a 50% success rate, however the development of specific antivirals targeting the HCV polymerase and protease has dramatically improved patient outcomes [52], [54]. Understanding the mechanisms by which HCV antagonises STING is of interest because it may help explain why the immune system spontaneously clears acute HCV infection in some patients, but not others, as well as why viral genotype-specific differences in the success of antiviral therapies are observed in the clinic [54].",

MAVS and NS3/4A colocalise at MAMs, and following its cleavage, MAVS loses its ability to dimerise, associate with intracellular membranes and signal the induction of type I IFN [52]. Cheng et al. were the first to report an NS3/4A-independent mechanism by which HCV counteracts IFN production [56]. In this article, inhibitors of the NS3/4A protease were shown to block the ability of HCV to antagonise IFN-\u03b2 induced by MAVS over-expression, but not when IFN-\u03b2 production was stimulated by poly(I:C) transfection [56]. Later, two reports published in quick succession independently demonstrated that transiently over-expressed NS4B inhibited activation of an IFN-\u03b2 reporter stimulated with poly(I:C) [57] or by over-expression of the constitutively active \u0394RIG-I construct [21], [58]. A concomitant reduction in downstream IFN signalling was also observed [58]. Importantly, these observations were not viral strain-specific [58].",

            "text": "While this early work identified an important novel role for NS4B in blocking type I IFN responses during HCV infection, it was not until 2013 that the mechanism of this antagonism was published. Following up on their initial findings [58], research led by Mamoru Watanabe demonstrated that NS4B inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production and IRF-3 phosphorylation stimulated by poly(dA:dT) treatment, or STING, MAVS or \u0394RIG-I over-expression [10]. Ding et al. independently made similar observations, and also showed that NS4B blocks type III IFN induction during SeV infection [13]. NS4B did not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production stimulated by over-expression of IRF-3 or NF-\u03baB, suggesting that NS4B acts upstream of IRF-3 [13]. The NS3/4A protease complex did not block STING-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction or IRF-3 phosphorylation [10], confirming that NS3/4A and NS4B antagonise IFN production by distinct mechanisms. In addition, NS4B, but not NS3/4A, inhibited IFN production induced by over-expression of a MAVS construct that mimics the product of NS3/4A-mediated MAVS cleavage [10], [13]. This MAVS cleavage product loses its ability to dimerise and localise to the mitochondrial membrane [59], [60], [61], but residual levels of IFN-\u03b2 induction are still detectable [10], [13], [59]. Therefore, HCV has evolved distinct and additive mechanisms involving NS4B and the NS3/4A protease for blocking IFN induction via RIG-I and STING.",

            "text": "Work by Ding et al. and the Watanabe group demonstrated that NS4B co-immunoprecipitates with STING when both proteins are over-expressed [10], [13]. Ding et al. further verified these findings with endogenous STING in the PH5CH8 hepatocyte cell line [13]. In addition, colocalisation of NS4B and STING was observed when both proteins were over-expressed [10], [13], with over-expressed NS4B and endogenous STING in PH5CH8 cells [13], and when STING was over-expressed during HCV infection in the hepatocyte cell line Huh7 [13]. These experiments are complicated by the fact that HCV only readily infects Huh7 cells, in which endogenous STING is undetectable by western blot [13]. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that findings from over-expression experiments have been validated with endogenous STING and during viral infection. Colocalisation and interaction of STING with NS4B was further verified using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), in which the activity of a split fluorescent protein (in this case monomeric Kusabira Green; mKG) is reconstituted when two proteins tagged with complementary mKG fragments interact in close proximity [10]. The interaction between NS4B and STING was shown to occur adjacent to and partially colocalised with MAMs [10], which is also the site at which STING associates with MAVS [8], [10]. However, NS4B interacted and colocalised only with STING, and not with MAVS [10], [13].",

            "text": "The precise mechanism by which NS4B inhibits STING signalling remains to be fully elucidated. Transient over-expression of NS4B does not appear to affect levels of endogenous STING or STING dimerisation [13]. There is conflicting evidence as to whether NS4B might inhibit the interaction between STING and MAVS [10], [13], and whether NS4B targets TBK1 to inhibit IFN production [13], [58]. These contradictory findings might stem from the limitations of over-expression experiments, and until better tissue culture models for HCV are developed it will remain challenging to validate these studies in the context of viral infection. Although the exact mechanism of STING antagonism remains unclear, the N-terminus of NS4B, which shares homology with STING's dimerisation domain, appears to be important [8], [10]. While this domain is not important for the ability of NS4B to colocalise with STING, it is essential for NS4B's ability to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 induction [10]. Interestingly, this STING homology domain is conserved in the NS4B proteins of other members of the Flaviviridae family [8], suggesting that the YFV NS4B might also inhibit STING signalling through a mechanism that is conserved between flaviviruses and hepaciviruses. The DENV NS4B also shares this homology domain [8]. In the future, it will be important to further clarify the mechanism and conservation of STING antagonism by Flaviviridae NS4B proteins. This is of particular interest because several antiviral compounds targeting the HCV NS4B are under development or in the early stages of clinical testing [reviewed in 63], and it has been suggested that they function at least in part by blocking the ability of HCV to inhibit innate immune responses important for viral clearance [10].",

Antagonism of STING by coronavirus PLPs has been most extensively studied for the SARS-CoV PLP, called PLpro. SARS-CoV was first identified in China in 2003 and rapidly spread around Southeast Asia, with isolated cases reported around the globe [65], [68]. The virus is thought to have originated from bats, with palm civet cats as a potential intermediate host that transmitted the virus to humans in the crowded live-animal markets of China [65]. SARS-CoV was an air-borne pathogen that caused a severe lower respiratory tract infection with an estimated case-fatality rate of around 10% [64], [65], [68]. The epidemic spread from Southeast Asia via international air travel and trade, and was contained largely by strict quarantine and travel restrictions [65]. More than 8000 SARS cases were reported in 2003, and since then no further human infections have been reported [65]. Nevertheless, the pertinence of studying the pathogenic mechanisms of this severe respiratory pathogen was highlighted when MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 [65].",

Dimerisation of over-expressed STING, which was enhanced by treatment with SeV, was reduced in the presence of PLpro [11]. Additionally, dimerisation of over-expressed STING was reduced during SARS-CoV infection [11]. Later, PLpro was also found to disrupt the formation of signalling complexes involved in the induction of type I IFN [14]. Specifically, PLpro co-immunoprecipitated with over-expressed TBK1 and (to a lesser extent) IRF-3, and also inhibited the binding of STING to MAVS and IRF-3 [14]. In addition, PLpro dramatically inhibited the activation of luciferase reporter constructs driven by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter or IRF-3-responsive elements when these were induced through the over-expression of STING or TBK1 [14]. IRF-3 phosphorylation and dimerisation induced by STING or TBK1 over-expression was also reduced in the presence of PLpro [14]. In combination, these findings demonstrate that PLpro associates with the signalling complexes assembled around STING, disrupting their formation to block downstream signalling via IRF-3. It remains to be determined whether PLpro interacts with STING directly, or whether other components of the signalling complex are required. However, other viral proteins are not necessary for mediating the interaction between PLpro and STING [11], [14].",

            "text": "It has been proposed that PLpro inhibits IRF-3 activation by virtue of its deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, interfering with K63-linked ubiquitination events known to be important for downstream type I IFN induction [11], [14]. Initially, X-ray crystallography studies highlighted structural similarities between PLpro and cellular DUBs [72]. Subsequently, purified PLpro was shown to hydrolyse K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, as well as the ubiquitin-like molecule ISG15, in vitro\n[73], [74], [75]. Deubiquitinating activity was also observed in cultured cells [71], [73], [75]. Of note, the modification of over-expressed STING, TBK1, RIG-I and IRF-3 with an HA-tagged ubiquitin construct that is only capable of forming K63-linked bonds (HA-Ub-K63) was also reduced in the presence of PLpro [14]. Surprisingly then, chemical inhibitors of PLpro's DUB activity do not affect PLpro's ability to antagonise type I IFN induction [71]. Furthermore, inactivation of PLpro's DUB domain by point mutation failed to abrogate its ability to block IFN-\u03b2 induction by SeV [70]. A confounding factor in these experiments is that the importance of functional DUB activity was not always measured in the presence of STING-specific stimuli. Therefore DUB-inactive PLpro may inhibit type I IFN induction by a STING-independent mechanism, for example by targeting IRF-3 directly [70]. In addition, the Chen group has proposed that, in the absence of a functional DUB domain, PLpro is still able to block K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING signalling complex components by preventing access to the cellular ubiquitination machinery [11], [71], [76]. Alternatively, since catalytically inactive PLpro mutants still interact with STING [11], they may function by sequestering STING away from other molecules required for the induction of type I IFN. While the precise mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated, an increasing body of work has clearly demonstrated that the SARS-CoV PLpro protein interacts with STING to prevent its dimerisation and association with other signalling molecules required for the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3.",

            "text": "Despite the low sequence conservation between SARS-CoV PLpro and HCoV-NL63 PLP2 [75], the mechanism of action of these two proteins appears to be very similar. PLP2 was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with STING in over-expression experiments, and this interaction was independent of PLP2's catalytic activities [11]. Furthermore, exogenously expressed PLP2 colocalised with STING in a pattern reminiscent of the ER [11]. A partial colocalisation between nsp3, which contains the PLP2 domain, and over-expressed STING was also observed in cells infected with HCoV-NL63 [11]. Importantly, PLP2 was shown to disrupt STING dimerisation, as well as the interaction between STING and TBK1 in over-expression experiments [11]. Interestingly, the DUB activity of HCoV-NL63 was found to be important for the inhibition of STING dimerisation [11]. Whether DUB activity is also important for the ability of SARS-CoV PLpro to inhibit STING dimer formation has not been published. Similarly to SARS-CoV PLpro though, the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING was still inhibited in HCoV-NL63 PLP2 mutants that lacked DUB activity, albeit to a lesser degree [11]. As before, the authors speculated that STING-PLP2 binding may prevent the cellular ubiquitination machinery from modifying STING, regardless of whether PLP2 retains its ability to actively deubiquitinate STING [11]. Since certain PLP2 mutants that lack DUB activity are still capable of blocking STING-dependent IFN production, even though they do not prevent STING activation (dimerisation), these constructs may function by sequestering STING away from other proteins required for the induction of type I IFN [11].",

PEDV PLP2 also co-immunoprecipitates with STING in over-expression experiments, and reduces the modification of STING with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains [15]. However, unlike the coronavirus PLPs discussed so far, the ability of PEDV PLP2 to inhibit STING ubiquitination and type I IFN induction appears to be dependent on its DUB activity [15]. The authors speculated that, since the PLP constructs in the PEDV study differ from the others in that they are not linked to the C-terminal transmembrane domain of nsp3, the transmembrane domain may somehow modify PLP function [15]. In fact, the transmembrane domain was previously shown to augment IFN antagonism by both wt and catalytically-inactive HCoV-NL63 PLP2 [71]. It was proposed that the transmembrane domain may be required for the correct folding of PLP2 or for mediating interactions with components of the IFN pathway [71]. Therefore, while it is becoming increasingly clear that several coronavirus PLPs antagonise STING, certain mechanistic details, including the roles of the DUB and transmembrane domains, remain to be elucidated.",

In addition, the PLP2 of the betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) has also been shown to have DUB and IFN antagonist activity [77], [78]. Whether MERS-CoV PLP2 and MHV-A59 PLP2 block type I IFN induction by targeting STING remains to be determined. It would be highly interesting to perform a systematic comparison of STING antagonism in different coronavirus PLPs using human STING as well as STING homologues from the animal reservoirs for these viruses. Such experiments would provide valuable insights into the evolutionary pressure posed by STING, the adaptations required for coronaviruses to emerge as zoonotic pathogens of humans, and the potential contribution of STING antagonism to disease severity in highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Such studies have gained in pertinence with the emergence of MERS-CoV as the most-recent highly pathogenic coronavirus with epidemic potential in humans.",

While we do not yet fully understand all of the mechanisms by which STING participates in the recognition of RNA virus infection, the multiple evasion tactics employed by divergent positive-sense RNA viruses imply that STING is a significant restriction factor for these pathogens. Exciting avenues for future research include the as-yet poorly defined mechanisms by which STING signalling is triggered during RNA virus infection. It will be highly interesting to investigate whether STING responds to RNA and DNA viruses via similar or distinct mechanisms. An intriguing possibility is that STING senses RNA viruses independently of the well-characterised nucleic acid PAMPs studied to-date, for example by responding to the aberrant modification of cellular membranes. Another key question regards the importance of STING in sensing and restricting negative-sense RNA virus infection. While improving our understanding of the mechanisms of STING activation during RNA virus infection will go some way towards answering this question, the clinching evidence will be to identify a STING antagonist in a negative-sense RNA virus, as viruses do not develop immune evasion mechanisms without a strong evolutionary imperative to do so.",

Following its activation, STING dimerises and relocalises to perinuclear punctate domains, where it interacts with TBK1 to phosphorylate IRF-3. Activated STING is also modified by phosphorylation and K63-linked polyubiquitination. Following its activation, IRF-3 dimerises and translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of the type I interferons IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. RNA viruses have been proposed to be sensed by three distinct mechanisms in relation to STING activation. (1) Viral dsRNA replication intermediates and stem-loop structures, and the 5\u2032-triphosphates of uncapped viral RNAs are recognised by RIG-I, which associates with MAVS and STING at MAMs to activate STING. (2) The DNA sensor cGAS has been linked to the sensing of positive-sense RNA viruses by an as-yet undefined mechanism. In this scenario, cGAS produces the messenger molecule cGAMP after detecting RNA virus infection, and cGAMP binds and activates STING. (3) Viral fusion events at the plasma membrane have been shown to activate STING by a poorly-defined mechanism involving PI(3)K and phospholipase C-\u03b3 (PLC-\u03b3).
