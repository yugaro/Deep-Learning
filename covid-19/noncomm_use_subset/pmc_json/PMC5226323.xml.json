In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays.",

This platform was initially used with cyanine-based double-stranded DNA binding chemistry2 and is now available for probe-based chemistry using dark quenching probes3. This platform has primarily been used for genetic profiling in humans4 and animals5.

The system draws the master mix and sample across the surface of up to 4 plates (192 samples and controls) at a time.

Respiratory samples tested included nasal swabs, deep pharyngeal swabs, trans-tracheal washes, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue. Since some of the agents tested may also be present in peripheral blood or feces, we incorporated those types of samples into the procedure. This streamlined workflow helps save time and resources compared to running experiments in multiple plates by enabling efficient testing through panel-based pathogen and toxin gene detection in place of individual testing. The respiratory panel demonstrated here had 18 assays each printed in triplicate through-holes, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate. The equine pathogens detected included equine adenovirus 1 and 2, equine arteritis virus, equine rhinitis virus A and B, equine herpesvirus (EHV) types 1 and 4, and Streptococcus equi. The canine pathogens included canine respiratory coronavirus (betacoronavirus), canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma cynos.

We have also had success using the same procedure for enteric pathogen profiling in fecal samples and bacterial isolates on a separately customized plate. Once the plates are produced, experienced staff can complete steps 2-7 within one standard workday. The most critical steps are the proper sealing of the preamp plate, the transfer of preamplified samples between plates (which must be done rapidly to prevent evaporation), and the final covering of the amplification plate. Use of the macro spreadsheet as a guide for result analysis (checking curves for samples and controls) was also critical as it greatly reduced the amount of time and paperwork needed for this process. The provided macro spreadsheet is an example; it would need to be modified or re-created for plates with different configurations.

            "text": "Due to the very small amount of sample loaded onto the amplification plate (33 nl), pre-amplification is required. In the optimization of this protocol (not shown), we compared a number of preamplification parameters including the master mix, addition of random primers, number of cycles, annealing time, and dilution prior to amplification. Each target had its own optimal conditions, and those described here represent those that yielded the best limit of detection overall for our panel. This panel covers a wide range of pathogenic targets and sample types that are encountered in routine veterinary diagnostic testing, but modifications to the preamplification procedures may be necessary for different panels. The manufacturer-optimized amplification conditions are based on a standard probe-based real-time PCR protocol with a 10 min at 95 \u00b0C enzyme activation followed by denaturation at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extension at 60 \u00b0C. The primers and probes are pre-printed on the plates also using manufacturer-optimized conditions and therefore do not require titration. Combining the reverse-transcription and pre-amplification steps for all samples (regardless of the type of target) was necessary in order to maintain efficiency in the workflow. Having all samples reverse transcribed is also beneficial for maximizing sensitivity. Furthermore, use of a master mix for the preamp that is optimized for minimizing inhibitors allows versatility in combining different sample types on the same plate.",

It has been used around the world as part of a CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel and a CDC Swine Flu Panel. The EHV-1 assay8 adapted here detects an important respiratory pathogen of horses that can cause abortions and neurologic disease (reviewed by Pusterla and Hussey10).

This was likely due to the sub-optimal melting temperature (Tm) of the primers, which should ideally be 58-60 \u00b0C (the ideal probe Tm is 68-70 \u00b0C). A limitation of this platform is that it takes longer to design and manufacture the plates than for ordering individual probes, which limits the ability to quickly modify sequences. Another limitation of real-time PCR in general is the inability to detect novel or unexpected pathogens. This can be overcome to some extent by designing assays that match sequences in multiple species, but unbiased whole genome sequencing based methodologies are more suited for discovery of novel agents.11,12",

Collection of swab samples early, generally within 3 days of clinical onset, provides the best chance to identify the presence of respiratory pathogens. Infectious disease emergence is often unpredictable, and tests that can be performed on different species without the need for modification of reagents are ideal for preparedness. Future applications of this technology are likely to be in pathotyping, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and further syndrome-based clinical diagnostic panels. Nanoscale real-time PCR is most useful for rapid, high-throughput screening of multiple sample and pathogen types, and would be complemented by unbiased or partially biased sequencing-based approaches for identifying new and emergent pathogens.",
