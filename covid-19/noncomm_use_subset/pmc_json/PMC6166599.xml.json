In our study, the AFE measures the percentage of ARIs in virus-positive children attributable to that particular virus. The AFE does not inform on the aetiology at an individual level, but is a key population-level metric for interpreting positive specimen results. It assists with estimation of the true burden of disease, thus guiding preventative strategies for respiratory infections, such as immunisation. Virus-specific AFE estimates for ARI in children are reported infrequently, with most studies reporting AFEs having important methodological limitations. Except for one community study,5 these investigations recruited either highly selected hospitalised children or outpatients as study cases,6\u20138 or used controls from outpatient clinics.6 7 A meta-analysis of 23 studies that calculated virus-specific AFEs included 22 studies employing hospital-based case ascertainment and only three using community-based controls.9 Other studies comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic groups calculated odds ratios (ORs),10\u201312 or relative risks,13 without calculating AFEs. Moreover, several studies focused solely either on specific viruses10 12 or outcomes.6 11\u201313",

It was conducted in the subtropical city of Brisbane, Australia (latitude 27\u00b0 South, average monthly maximum temperature range 22\u00b0C\u201330\u00b0C, maximum rainfall in December-February, population 2.2 million) between September 2010 and October 2014. Parents consented antenatally for their child\u2019s participation. For enrolment, infants needed to be healthy, without congenital abnormalities or underlying chronic disorders, and to be born at term (36\u201342 weeks). Recruitment was progressive over 2 years at one of two metropolitan hospitals (one private and one government-funded). Detailed methods of recruitment, study design and sample and data collection are described elsewhere.14 The Children\u2019s Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital, and The University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committees approved the study.",

Regular parent-collected nasal swabs avoids the need for home visits by research staff or clinic attendance during an ARI, minimising possible biased estimates of ARI events and specimen availability from losing families failing to seek healthcare. Moreover, regular weekly nasal swab collections increase the likelihood of virus detections during an ARI episode rather than relying simply on results from a single specimen. Our previous work found that with sensitive PCR techniques, parent-collected nose or nose-throat swabs sent to the laboratory by standard mail had comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs obtained by healthcare workers.18 19 30 Longitudinal data collection also allows assessment of asymptomatic status by considering past and future illness history, as some viruses are detectable days before and after ARI symptoms develop,31 and are therefore less likely to yield false-positive findings.",

To reduce the chances of false-negative test results,21 we excluded from analysis 2679 (23.9%) swabs where the internal control for human DNA, ERV-3, was either undetected or present at very low levels. We excluded both virus-positive and virus-negative swabs to avoid overestimating our incidence and prevalence rates. In addition, some viruses were detected rarely, in particular influenza, a finding reflected in other community studies,17 but nevertheless limiting our ability to provide precise AFE estimates for these agents. We also excluded codetections in individual virus assessments as multiple aetiological agents make individual contributions of each agent difficult to ascertain, but analysed them separately to look at the association patterns of individual viruses. Symptom information, other than doctor-diagnosed otitis media and pneumonia, captured by daily diaries was not validated. To maximise accuracy, parents were trained to recognise symptoms before commencing the study. While healthcare worker-validated symptoms would be ideal, a study of this scale is logistically challenging without parent participation. This study design has been used previously18 and with others have shown that parents can be trained to recognise symptoms of interest,18 often as reliably as healthcare professionals.32 33 Our rates of ARI, including those associated with wheeze, are comparable with other community studies.34 35",

A slightly higher proportion (80%\u201385%) of our cohort attended some form of care by the age of 15\u201324 months, compared with 74% of children in the Australian population, with childcare attendance an independent risk factor for ARIs.25 Moreover, the incidence of ARIs in the ORChID cohort22 is comparable to other reports in this age group34 36 37 and RSV and HRV-associated ARIs approximate other community-based studies conducted in more temperate climates of Australia (Perth) and Europe.38\u201340 Our findings for this cohort remain valid and provide important estimates on community respiratory virus exposures and ARIs in Australian children in a subtropical, urban setting.",

With molecular methods used increasingly to detect respiratory viruses in young children, our study provides insights into supporting attribution for virus-specific ARIs in this age group managed within the community. The established RNA respiratory viruses and AdV were more strongly associated with symptomatic than asymptomatic infections, while no such associations were found for the newly described DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1. These data emphasise the high community levels of HRV circulating among children. Importantly, they also provide evidence to suggest that the current clinical trials of candidate RSV and HMPV vaccines seeking to protect infants against severe disease and hospitalisation might also deliver substantial health benefits for all young children within the community.27",
