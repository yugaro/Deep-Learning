However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown.

In children, M. pneumonia was the most frequent pneumonia-causing bacterium, regardless of the type of preceding virus.

Instead, gramnegative bacteria such as Klebsiella spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were identified. Bacterial pathogens in patients with human rhinovirus infection included S. aureus, Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., and C. pneumoniae. In another study, post-rhinovirus bacterial pathogens included H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis15. hMPV infection preceded pneumonia caused by S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp. In a previous study, six patients with community-acquired pneumonia had hMPV infection and complicating bacterial pneumonia with S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, or C. pneumoniae16.

In another study, RSV and hMPV in children, and rhinovirus and hMPV in adults, were strongly associated with community-acquired pneumonia18. Yet another study suggested that hMPV frequently induces pneumonia complicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients without significant comorbidities or immunosuppression19. Taken together, hMPV can cause more serious diseases, such as pneumonia and ARDS, compared with influenza virus. Therefore, research on hMPV, including the development of therapeutic agents, is urgently required. In addition, we found that secondary bacterial pneumonia were relatively common in patients with pneumonia secondary to influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and hMPV infections, a finding that has not been reported previously.

Third, we did not evaluate the underlying disease (malnutrition, steroid use) and lung condition (bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) that could affect bacterial colonization.

Despite the study limitations, the findings are significant because of the lack of previous research on the etiology of secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with respiratory virus infections other than influenza, and they will aid in the appropriate selection of empirical antibiotics for patients with (proven) respiratory viral infection and (radiological) pneumonia. For the treatment of post-viral pneumonia in infants and children, antibiotics with activity against M. pneumoniae (e.g., macrolides) should be considered. In adults, antistaphylococcal antibiotics should be considered when pneumonia occurs in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and hMPV infections, while antibiotics against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria should be considered when pneumonia occurs after coronavirus and parainfluenza virus infections. To confirm our retrospective results, further replicative prospective studies are needed.",
