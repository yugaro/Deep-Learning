The possibility that it was composed of two interactive peptides as the putative PLP1 and PLP2 in MHV was excluded, based on homologous comparison with PLPs in other coronaviruses. Substrate specificities of the PLP show that it has several preferred cleavage sites in different coronaviruses (3). We have found that the structural S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nuleocapsid) proteins, have 18, 1, 4 and 10 possible cleavage sites, respectively. However, amino acids around those cleavage sites might also be the major determinants for recognition (10). Therefore, among the above 33 sites, we could only identify, with certainty, one cleavage site (a.a. position 39, RG|V) in the S protein and two (a.a. position 198, RG|N and a.a. position 205, RG|N) in the N protein by the PLP.",
