LRI was diagnosed when abnormal findings were observed in chest imaging studies.

Hospital-acquired respiratory illness was defined if respiratory symptoms developed 2 or more days after admission. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3. Steroid use was defined if any type of glucocorticoids equivalent to 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 20 mg/day) of prednisolone or more were administered for longer than 5 days within 1 month prior to the development of respiratory illness.

Among respiratory symptoms, sputum (p=0.028) and dyspnea (p=0.001) were more frequently accompanied by LRIs. More patients with LRIs experienced co-infections than those with URIs (p=0.029). Among the five patients with LRIs and co-infections, four experienced invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: two of whom had concomitant RSV infection, another had concomitant adenovirus infection, and the other had HMPV infection. The other experienced C. difficile infection with concomitant parainfluenza virus infection. The two patients with URIs and co-infections experienced chickenpox with concomitant rhinovirus infection, and S. epidermidis bacteremia with concomitant RSV infection, respectively. The rate of rhinovirus infection was significantly higher in patients with URIs than in those with LRIs (p=0.021). Other viral infections showed no significant association with LRIs (Table 1). There were no independent risk factors for LRI in multivariate analysis (data are not shown). Of 14 patients with parainfluenza virus infection, five (35.7%) received ribavirin treatment and one (7.1%) also received IVIG. Of 10 patients with RSV infections, eight (80.0%) received ribavirin treatment and three (30.0%) also received IVIG. Patients with LRIs were more likely to receive oxygen therapy (p<0.001) than those with URIs and mortality was higher in patients with LRIs compared to those with URIs, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.101). All of the fatalities in both groups were caused by uncontrolled underlying malignancies.",

As a matter of fact, patients in Group II, in whom the presence of RVs was not identified, were more likely to have neutropenia, hospital-acquired and severe respiratory illnesses, and infections with non-viral pathogens. This suggests that patients in Group II underwent more aggressive anti-cancer chemotherapies, had a more severe immunosuppression, and were hospitalized for longer periods, compared to patients in Group I. Thus, pulmonary edema arising from hyper-hydration during anti-cancer chemotherapy, pulmonary hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia, and bacterial and fungal pneumonias could lead to respiratory symptoms in these patients. A negative PCR result in patients with NF and hospital-acquired respiratory illnesses may suggest the presence of more severe infection or treatment-related complications.",

Ribavirin-based anti-viral therapy can reduce progression from URI to LRI and mortality in RSV-infected HCT recipients;23 however, it is not recommended in patients with hematological malignancies who are not receiving HCT and its effect on parainfluenza virus infection has not been confirmed.24 In this study, 80.0% of patients diagnosed with RSV infection received ribavirin-based anti-viral therapy, regardless of receiving HCT, and none of them died due to RSV infection.

Low absolute lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts; relapsed underlying malignancies; unrelated or mismatched allogeneic-HCT; recent steroid use; oxygen need; and co-infections are risk factors for LRI or mortality.9,10,23,25\u201327 These risk factors represent the severity of immune suppression in the infected hosts.9,25 Accordingly, an immunodeficiency scoring system to predict outcomes and determine the administration of anti-viral therapy has been applied to RSV-infected HCT recipients.28 The uncontrolled state of underlying hematological malignancies and the presence of co-infections were significantly associated with the development of LRI in this study, which underscores the importance of the host\u2019s overall immune status in the outcome of RVI. As a result, a multiplex PCR test for RVs should be performed preferentially in patients complaining of rhinorrhea or sputum and with relapsed or refractory underlying hematological malignancies, co-infections, or severe cytopenia.

The seasonal distribution and epidemics of RVI in immune compromised patients are correlated with those observed in the community.8,29 During the study period, the epidemics of RSV and influenza virus infection in the community were not prominent in Korea compared to previous years. The inclusion of more RSV and influenza virus infection episodes may modify the outcome of RVI in this study. Future studies should analyze data gathered for several years to include more cases of RVI caused by a variety of RVs. A multiplex PCR test for RVs was not routinely performed in children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms in our hospital during the study period and was hardly performed in the outpatient clinic. Therefore, children and adolescents with mild respiratory symptoms and URIs could not be included in this study. The outcomes of RVI in immune compromised children and adolescents may be more favorable with the inclusion of mild RVI cases.",

Moreover, the PCR test should address patients with more severe immune suppression, e.g., those with relapsed or refractory underlying malignancies and co-infections, as they are prone to have severe RVI-related outcomes. In addition, infection control strategies to prevent RVI transmission within the hospital environment should be emphasized, considering the current scenario, in which effective anti-viral therapies have not been established for most RVI cases. Thus, early RVI detection by a PCR test may open a window of opportunity for early intervention and infection control.",
