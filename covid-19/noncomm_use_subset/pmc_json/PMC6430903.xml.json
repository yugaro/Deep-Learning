With rising prevalence, the disease is of growing concern to clinicians. Due to similarities with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), establishing a diagnosis is challenging and may require extensive histology, immunohistochemistry and clonality analyses. However, these diagnostic tests are not broadly available. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether usual clinical and/or paraclinical parameters may differentiate LGAL from IBD.",

Similar FMT donor\u2010recipient microbiota interactions in recipient sick dogs have not been reported. The authors hypothesized that a single FMT would temporarily increase microbiota diversity and aimed to determine if FMT can substantially alter the microbiota diversity for a month. The hypothesis was tested in a canine haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (HDS) model, which is associated with gut dysbiosis. Eight dogs with clinical signs of HDS (1:1 ratio) were randomized to receive FMT (recipient) or saline (control) via colonoscopy. The Pielou alpha bacterial diversity indexes (PABDI) were compared (through sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene) in faecal samples from recipients, controls and matched donors obtained at admission (before FMT), discharge, and at 30\u2010day recheck. We also compared a previously validated HDS clinical score between recipients and controls. The recipient PABDI differed substantially between the time of admission and discharge (P 0.02) and was similar to the donors\u2019 PABDI at discharge (P 0.39). However, the recipients\u2019 PABDI did not differ between the time of admission and recheck (P 0.77). In contrast, the PABDI of the donors and controls did not change at any point during the study. The HDS clinical score did not differ between recipients and controls (P 0.14). In conclusion, FMT transiently altered the recipients\u2019 bacterial diversity. Further studies are required to determine the number of repeated FMT procedures that will lead to a long\u2010term increase in bacterial diversity.",

            "text": "It is commonly accepted that dogs suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with protein\u2010losing enteropathy (PLE) need more aggressive immunosuppressive treatment than dogs with IBD but no PLE. At our hospital, treatment of PLE\u2010IBD follows a step\u2010wise algorithm to assess response to diet, antibiotics & prednisolone first, with second\u2010line immunosuppressants (SLI) only added if initial response is not satisfactory. It was hypothesised that results from this approach will challenge the need for SLI in many cases. Files of dogs diagnosed with PLE from 2015 to 2017 (n=68) were retrospectively analysed. Exclusion criteria were lack of initial serum albumin (SA) value (n=5), lack of histopathological diagnosis (n=9), diagnosis not compatible with IBD (intestinal lymphoma n=3, intestinal adenocarcinoma n=2, intussusception n=3, granulomatous colitis n=2, nutritional deficit n=1), significant intestinal bleeding contributing to protein loss (n=1), and significant concurrent disease (PLN n=1, endocrinopathies n=2, EPI n=1). In the remaining 38 dogs (15 FN, 14 MN, 6 ME, 3 FE; mean age of 7 y, sd 2.5), initial mean SA was 19.8g/l (sd 4.5) with the lowest recorded SA after diagnosis 17.7g/l mean (sd 4.7). 17/38 dogs had concurrent hypoglobulinaemia, 24/37 hypocholesterolaemia, 36/38 total and 5/31 ionised hypocalcaemia, 18/38 total hypomagnesaemia. Serum cobalamin was low in 21/36 dogs (58%). According to the treatment algorithm, 2 dogs (5%) were treated with diet alone, 5 dogs (13%) with diet + antibiotics, 17 dogs (44%) with diet, antibiotics and prednisolone. 14 dogs (36%) subsequently needed SLI, which in 10/14 cases was cyclosporine and 4 dogs receiving another SLI (cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, chlorambucil). Overall time until SA rose above 20g/l was median 11 days (range 0\u2010136 days) and median follow\u2010up time was 79 days (range 4\u2010463 days). 8 dogs were deceased by the end of the study (21%). There was no difference between dogs with and without SLI regarding clinicopathological data (t\u2010tests, Kruskal Wallis tests). No correlation between these variables, treatment requirements, time to normalisation of SA or outcome could be detected. In conclusion, contrary to previous literature, SLI were not needed in the majority of dogs with PLE\u2010IBD (24/38 = 63%), which suggests a step\u2010wise treatment approach often used in IBD without PLE can be appropriate in these cases and might lower costs for drugs substantially. In addition, none of the clinicopathological parameters routinely assessed in these cases correlated with prognosis or outcome, illustrating the lack of useful markers to predict the clinical course of PLE\u2010IBD in dogs.",

Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (BCS, Range 3\u20107/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNF\u03b1 were measured in stromovascular cells (SVC) cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10\u03bcM, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), or palmitic acid, at 25\u03bcM, 50\u03bcM, or 100\u03bcM. SVC of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P=0.003). AA treatment at 25\u03bcM, 50\u03bcM, and 100\u03bcM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P=0.045, P=0.002, and P<0.001, respectively) and visceral (P=0.034, P=0.001, and P<0.001, respectively) derived SVC.

            "text": "Pheochromocytoma is relatively common in dogs and carries a guarded prognosis. Outcome of adrenalectomy is the most important predictor of survival, although younger age and absence of vascular invasion may also be associated with a favourable prognosis. Current histological criteria do not predict a malignant behaviour in dogs, similar to humans. In the latter, the characterization of tumors has been refined by the \u201cPheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score\u201d (PASS), which includes 12 microscopic features, and by immunohistochemical analysis. The aim of the study was to investigate PASS and several immunohistochemical markers used in human medicine in dogs with pheochromocytoma that underwent adrenalectomy. Pathology records of dogs with pheochromocytomas were reviewed to identify those treated surgically and tumors were collected. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to apply the PASS and were single\u2010labelled for chromogranin A, proliferation marker Ki\u201067, cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102), tumor suppressor gene product p53, proto\u2010oncogene products BCL\u20102 and c\u2010erbB\u20102, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), protein S100. The results of PASS and of immunohistochemistry were compared for surgical outcome, age and frequency of capsular and vascular invasion caused by the tumor. In addition, PASS was assessed in relation to immunohistochemical findings. Twenty\u2010four dogs with pheochromocytomas were included. PASS did not differ based on surgical outcome, age, vascular and capsular invasion. Immunohistochemistry was also not different for any variable. Tumors showing BCL\u20102 expression in >50% cells had lower PASS than those with lower expression (7\u00b12 vs. 9\u00b12; P=0.011). Tumors positive for S100 had higher PASS than those negative (10\u00b12 vs. 7\u00b12; P=0.001). Associations between immunohistochemical markers were not identified. In conclusion, in dogs with pheochromocytoma, survival, age, vascular and capsular invasion are not linked to the results of PASS and of the selected immunohistochemical markers. The lower PASS in dogs with elevated BCL\u20102 expression suggests that pheochromocytomas with high anti\u2010apoptotic rate have few morphologic changes. The higher PASS in S100\u2010positive tumors may indicate that pheochromocytomas developing morphologic changes acquire S100 expression. Overall, the use of PASS and of the present immunohistochemical markers is of limited clinical value in dogs with pheochromocytoma.",

            "text": "Thyroid autoantibodies are used as markers of autoimmune thyroiditis in humans and dogs. In humans, their presence is associated with a 2.5\u20105.0% per year progression from subclinical thyroiditis to hypothyroidism. Several survey studies have shown an increased prevalence of positive thyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAA) in dogs with thyroid test results indicative of primary hypothyroidism versus euthyroid dogs. The implications of a positive TgAA result with otherwise normal concentrations of thyroid hormones and TSH (subclinical thyroiditis) on the subsequent progression to hypothyroidism in dogs are less clear. The objective of this study was to define the outcome of thyroid status in dogs with subclinical thyroiditis over a multi\u2010year interval. Purebred dogs with subclinical thyroiditis (>25% specific TgAA binding but with normal concentrations of T4, FT4 and TSH) were identified from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) Thyroid Registry database. Owners were invited to arrange submission of a follow\u2010up serum sample with their veterinarian along with inclusion of a medical history form including subsequent treatments. Serum samples were obtained from 114 dogs with subclinical thyroiditis that met inclusion criteria. The study population included 62 female and 52 male dogs from 30 breeds with English Setters, Boxers, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Dalmatians most frequent. The average age at study completion was 6.3 years (SD = 2.2 years, range 2\u201013). The mean follow\u2010up time was 3.9 years from initial testing (SD = 2.0 years, range 1\u20109). At the time of retesting, 33% of the dogs had progressed to hypothyroidism, or were treated with thyroxine. Fifty\u2010one percent maintained positive or equivocal TgAA results while remaining euthyroid. In 16% of dogs, TgAA results had normalized with dogs remaining euthyroid. Initiation of thyroxine supplementation following a TgAA\u2010positive result was usually, but not always, based on suggestive clinical signs and decreased thyroid hormones at subsequent testing. These results suggest that the majority of dogs with elevated thyroglobulin autoantibodies either exhibit persistent autoimmune thyroiditis with continued risk of hypothyroidism or progress to hypothyroidism.",

Unwell dogs were excluded from further analysis, regardless of the control of their HAC. Haptoglobin was measured as part of our normal monitoring using a commercially available immunoturbidimetric assay (Avacta Laboratories, Wetherby). There were 44 samples, obtained from 19 dogs. One dog was noted as being particularly anxious before 2 sampling points and its pre\u2010trilostane cortisol concentrations were excluded from all subsequent analysis. Mann Whitney tests demonstrated that there were significant differences between both the pre\u2010trilostane cortisol (p=0.036) and haptoglobin (p=0.012) of dogs classified as being controlled and those that were uncontrolled. There was a significant correlation between all the haptoglobin concentrations and the owners score (r=0.52, p<0.001) whereas pre\u2010trilostane cortisol concentrations were not significantly correlated with the score (r=0.27, p=0.13).

SF (nitrotetrazole blue method, Fructosamine 17350H, Sentinel Diagnostics) and blood HbA1c (HbA1c, OSR6192 Beckman\u2010Coulter) were analyzed on an automated chemistry analyzer (Beckman\u2010Coulter AU 480). Linearity, precision and accuracy were determined; a reference interval for HbA1c and SF was established from 40 healthy dogs, using the percentile method. Performances of HbA1c and SF in assessing the glycemic control were evaluated; correlation between the two variables and a clinical score was studied in 200 re\u2010evaluations of 47 diabetic dogs treated with insulin q12h. The clinical score used to classify diabetic dogs in good (GGC), moderate (MGC) or poor (PGC) glycemic control was set on the basis of stability of body weight, presence of poliuria/polydipsia, median glucose of the blood glucose curves (BGCs), blood glucose nadir and overall evaluation of BGC. The average intra\u2010 and interassay coefficient of variation (CV) for HbA1c were 1.5% and 10.9%, respectively; the average intra\u2010 and interassay CV for SF were 4.1% and 2.5%, respectively. Excellent accuracy was obtained for both assays (r>0.99). The reference interval for HbA1c was 1.6\u20104.5% and for SF was 222\u2010382 \u03bcmol/L. In diabetic dogs, HbA1c and SF were significantly correlated (r=0.48) and they were also correlated with the clinical score (r=\u20100.33; r=\u20100.39, respectively). ROC curves analysis of SF and HbA1c to distinguish GGC from MGC/PGC dogs showed an AUC of 0.69 and 0.66, respectively. Values of HbA1c<5.5% and SF<400 \u03bcmol/L had Sp=79%, Se=41%, and Sp=71%, Se=61%, in discriminating dogs with GGC from MGC/PGC dogs, respectively. ROC curves analysis of SF and HbA1c to distinguish PGC from GGC/MGC dogs showed an AUC of 0.75 and 0.69, respectively. Values of HbA1c>6.8% and SF>500 \u03bcmol/L had Sp=79%, Se=52%, and Sp=85%, Se=45%, respectively, in discriminating dogs with PGC from GGC/MGC dogs. Using the clinical score as the reference method, SF and HbA1c identified correctly the glycemic control (GGC/MGC/PGC) in 50% and 44% of cases, respectively. In conclusion, SF and HbA1c have similar performances in classifying the glicemic control. Neither of the two parameters should be used as the sole indicator of glycemic control, and must always be evaluated in association with history, physical findings and BGC results.",

Although the condition is rare, we suspect that these documented cases represents only \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d of cats affected with this syndrome, because of the mild clinical signs displayed by these cats, and the lack of awareness of this condition by first opinion clinicians.

To our knowledge, there are no clinical veterinary studies on this topic. The aim of the present study is to evaluate pulmonary complications during canine AP and their association with the outcome. AP diagnosis was made if there were compatible clinical signs and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test and a positive abdominal ultrasound within 48 hours from the admission. Thoracic radiography was performed for each patient using a digital radiological equipment and subgraded base on the pulmonary pattern (normal, interstitial or alveolar). At the admission, arterial blood samples, obtained from the dorsal pedal artery, at room air (FiO2=21%), were analyzed (ABL 700 series, Radiometer, Denmark). ALI/ARDS were diagnosed using the current veterinary consensus: (1) acute onset (<72 hours) of respiratory distress (RD) (tachypnea and laboured breathing at rest), (2) known risk factors, (3) evidence of pulmonary capillary leak without cardiac disease and (4) evidence of inefficient gas exchange. Dogs were divided into 2 groups according to outcome at 15 days from their admission: survivors and non\u2010survivors. Normal distribution was assessed using D'Agostino\u2010Pearson test. Welch's t\u2010test was used to compare PaCO2, P[A\u2212a]O2 gradient with the outcome; meanwhile, pH, PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 were compared to the outcome using Mann\u2010Whitney U\u2010test. Exact tests were used to compare the presence of radiographic abnormalities, RD and ALI/ARDS to the outcome. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Twenty\u2010three client\u2010owned dogs with owners\u2019 consent, admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Ten dogs (43%) died during the study period. Two out of 10 dogs were euthanized due to poor prognosis or to progressive disease. Ten out of 23 dogs showed RD which was associated with poor outcome (p=0.0001; OR 108 95% CI 7\u20101225). Nineteen dogs (83%) showed radiographic alterations (10 alveolar pattern and 9 interstitial pattern) and they were associated to death (p=0.04). Non\u2010survivors showed a lower PaCO2 levels than survivors (p=0.009). P[A\u2212a]O2 gradient, pH, PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 were similar between groups. ALI was diagnosed in seven dogs (30%) and no dogs had ARDS. The presence of ALI was associated with poor outcome (p=0.0005). In dogs with AP, pulmonary complications seemed to be frequent and associated with risk of death. Moreover, ALI/ARDS may be a severe pulmonary complication affecting the prognosis, as well as in human medicine.",

Such an increase is not uniform and not all the individuals of the same age have the same risk of mortality. In humans, the risk of mortality and other adverse outcomes in elderly people is increasingly being assessed by means of the so\u2010called frailty index (FI). This index is calculated by considering a checklist of multidimensional health deficits (e.g. symptoms, signs, laboratory abnormalities) potentially accumulated by the aging individual. To calculate the FI, the actual number of deficits in an individual is counted and divided by the total number of deficits included in the checklist. In humans, the FI shows a moderate accuracy in the prediction of near term (less than 18 months) mortality. A specific FI has been developed also in mice. We developed a dogs\u2010specific FI computed by considering 33 deficits, that was divided into two parts: the first 19 questions were focused on the general health status as reported by the owner, whereas the second 14 questions reported the results of the clinical evaluation of the subject along with the findings of the diagnostic and laboratory tests performed during the routine clinical evaluation. Dogs presented to our facility between January 2017 and August 2017 were included. Inclusion criteria included a complete clinical evaluation of the subject and recent (less that 2 months) blood analysis. Fatalities were excluded from the study. Mortality was assessed six months after the FI was administered. 124 dogs belonging to several different breeds matched the inclusion criteria (mean age: 8,26\u00b1 4,4 years). The developed FI had a high diagnostic accuracy in the prediction of near term mortality (six months) with an area under the curve of 0,93 (95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.87\u20100.97); using a cut\u2010off value of 0,23 the sensitivity was 78,57% (95% CI= 49.2\u201095.3) and the specificity of 90,91% (95% CI= 83.9\u201095.6), the positive likelihood ratio was 8.64 (95% CI= 4.5\u201016.6), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.24 (95% CI = 0.09\u20100.6). There was a moderate (r= 0,454 \u2013 95% CI= 0.301\u20100.583) but significant (p= 0.001) correlation between the frailty index and age. A large\u2010scale use of the FI could provide new interesting information regarding the aging process in the dog.",

Feline CKD is characterized histologically by tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis; however, the molecular pathways associated with its progression have not been thoroughly characterized. Our group has recently described a model of feline CKD that utilizes unilateral in vivo ischemia to induce renal changes mimicking those of naturally occurring disease. The objective of this study was to characterize the renal transcriptome in an ischemic model of feline CKD using RNA sequencing. We hypothesized that 1) tissues from cats with experimental CKD would display increased genetic expression of molecular pathways associated with inflammation and fibrosis, and that 2) in cats having undergone unilateral renal ischemia, tissues from the contralateral (i.e., non\u2010ischemic) kidney would show differential genetic expression when compared to tissues from control cats.",

Main indications for TPE were immune diseases in 29 dogs (immune\u2010mediated hemolytic anemia, immune\u2010mediated thrombocytopenia, leptospirosis\u2010associated pulmonary hemorrhages and neuromuscular diseases). Other indications included polysystemic diseases in 5 dogs (sepsis, microangiopathy), and hyperviscosity in 3 dogs (leishmaniasis).

More recently, it has been demonstrated that the kidney biomarker Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) correlates with glomerular filtration rate, increasing earlier than sCr with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. This prospective study compared accuracy and precision of two commercial SDMA assays, the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test manufactured by IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and the SDMA ELISA manufactured by DLD Diagnostika, GmbH. Accuracy and precision for both commercial assays was measured relative to the established reference method, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS). Anonymized surplus canine and feline serum samples submitted to an IDEXX commercial reference laboratory were used in this study. Thirty canine and 30 feline serum samples were used to evaluate accuracy compared to LC\u2010MS. Pooled canine samples with a low SDMA concentration and pooled feline samples with a high SDMA concentration were used to evaluate precision. Using a best fit linear model, the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test resulted in a slope of 1.06 and an intercept of 0.23, with R2 = 0.99, and the DLD SDMA ELISA resulted in a slope of 0.38 and an intercept of 11.23, with R2 = 0.27. Estimated bias over a clinically relevant range for SDMA (10 \u2013 45 \u03bcg/dL) was 1\u20103\u03bcg/dL for the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test, while the DLD SDMA ELISA showed considerable bias, 5 to \u201017\u03bcg/dL. Day\u2010to\u2010day precision analysis of the low SDMA concentration samples showed 7.7% total coefficient of variation (CV) for the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test and 31.1% for the DLD SDMA ELISA. For the high SDMA concentration samples, total CV was 2.3% for the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test and 28.2% for the DLD SDMA ELISA. In this study the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test was more accurate and more precise than the DLD SDMA ELISA when compared to the reference method of LC\u2010MS, supporting the conclusion that the IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test is more suitable for clinical use in the diagnosis and monitoring of kidney disease in dogs and cats.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial prescription in cats in Switzerland with acute upper respiratory tract disease (aURTD) and feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). &#13Cases presented to two University hospitals and eight private veterinary practices during 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical history, diagnostic work\u2010up and antimicrobial therapy (class, dosage, duration) were assessed. A justification score (JS) was used to assess the agreement of antimicrobial prescription with current guidelines (1=appropriate, 2=incorrect dosage/duration, 3=inappropriate antimicrobial, 4=overall wrong treatment decision). &#13Of 142 cats with aURTD, 107 (75%) received antibiotic therapy of the following classes: potentiated aminopenicillins (51%), third generation cephalosporins (22%), aminopenicillins (21%), tetracyclines (17%), fluoroquinolones (5%), amphenicoles (2%), first generation cephalosporins and macrolides (1% each); 16% received combination or serial therapy. The cases were treated for 4 to 37 (median 10) days. When assessment of prudent use was possible (120/142), antimicrobial therapy was judged appropriate (JS\u20101) in 35 (29%) and inappropriate in 85 (71%) cases (JS\u20102=2; JS\u20103=38; JS\u20104=45). Antibiotic therapy was significantly associated with the presence of lethargy, anorexia or fever (p=0.003).&#13Of 252 cats with FLUTD, 150 cases (60%; 50 with bacterial cystitis, 100 with other/unknown diagnosis) received antibiotic therapy of the following classes: potentiated aminopenicillins (67%), third generation cephalosporins (18%), fluoroquinolones (13%), aminopenicillins (7%), first generation cephalosporins (4%), amphenicoles (1%) and tetracyclines (1%); 10% received combination or serial therapy. The cats were treated for 1 to 56 (median 11) days. When assessment of prudent use was possible (152/252), antimicrobial therapy was judged appropriate (JS\u20101) in 76 (50%) and inappropriate in 76 (50%) cases (JS\u20102=1; JS\u20103=28; JS\u20104=47); inadequate diagnostic work\u2010up (97/100) was the main reason to preclude judgment. Bacteriuria was significantly associated with antibiotic therapy (p<0.001). &#13Overall, frequency of antimicrobial therapy was not significantly different between university hospitals and private practices, but critically important antibiotics (third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones) were significantly more often used in private practices (aURTD, p=0.009; FLUTD, p<0.001).&#13Our results suggest that overprescription of antibiotics in cats with aURTD and FLUTD is common. Third generation cephalosporins are frequently used. The study highlights the need to promote antimicrobial stewardship in small animal medicine. To support this, an online tool (www.antibioticscout.ch) based on current veterinary guidelines was launched in 2017. The impact of this tool on prescribing habits will be assessed in the future.",

Canine HE is most commonly reported in association with congenial portosystemic shunting (cPSS). Although not completely characterised, several factors are known to influence the pathogenesis of HE, namely increased ammonia, inflammation and manganese, as well as alkalosis, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in the brain and by the enterochromaffin\u2010like cells in the gastric mucosa, with actions linked with regulation of the circadian rhythm, enterocyte integrity, and free oxygen radical scavenging, amongst others. The majority of melatonin is metabolised in the liver and recently, melatonin levels were noted to be significantly increased in human alcohol\u2010induced liver cirrhosis, correlating with both disease severity and with the severity of HE, hence hypothesised as a potential contributor to the development of the latter. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, melatonin homeostasis in canine liver disease is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether melatonin concentrations could be altered in dogs with cPSS, with the hypothesis that higher levels would be present when compared to healthy controls.",

Two\u2010dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2DE) and liquid chromatography\u2010tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS) were performed. Eight spots form 2DE were considered interesting due to their expression pattern and therefore were selected as candidates for LC\u2010MS/MS analysis. By consulting SwissProt & NCBInr databases, MASCOT and SONAR results allowed us to find the origin species of 4 out of 8 proteins: Canis lupis familiaris, Flavobacteriaceae bacterium, Prochlorococcus marinus, Candida glabrata. Especially the protein from Canis lupis familiaris resulted to be very interesting, cause owing to the hosts (dogs). It was identified as Immunoglobulin lambda\u20101 light chain isoform X36. If confirmed, this datum could be very interesting for the future perspectives of this kind of studies, being a protein involved in the immune response of the host, but also in some kind of tumor, and other pathological conditions.",

Ultranosographic features lacked specificity and etiology could not be determined in all cats: considered previous differentials were lymphoma or feline infectious peritonitis in 7 cases. Both ileum wall and ileocolic lymph nodes were enlarged. The ileocolic lymph nodes median size was 5 mm [range 4.7\u201014,5 mm]. Six of 8 cats underwent a complete surgical removal (enterectomy via ileocolic junction resection) and two cats were submitted to biopsies by laparotomy. The histopathological analysis of the ICM revealed feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic fibroplasia (1), inflammatory lesions and fibrosis secondary to a presumed prior foreign body (4), inflammatory lesion associated with campylobacteriosis and tritrichomonosis (1), fibrosis (1), postoperative granuloma (1). Two cats died in the post\u2010operative period (septic peritonitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation).

The aim of this study was to compare CTA to ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool in canine acute pancreatitis. Twenty\u2010five dogs met inclusion criteria: 15 prospectively enrolled and 10 included from a pilot project* in this cross\u2010sectional study. Inclusion was based on fulfilling two of three criteria: strong clinical suspicion of pancreatitis, ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis, and/or SNAPR positive canine pancreatitis lipase (cPLI) test. A SpecR cPLI was obtained and an abdominal ultrasound was performed followed within 24 hours by a sedated abdominal three phase CTA. The results showed that CTA visualized the entire pancreas in 100% of dogs; ultrasonography visualized the entire pancreas in 73% of dogs. 10/25 dogs had heterogeneous contrast enhancement of the pancreas. CTA significantly identified more portal vein thromboses than ultrasound; CT= 10/25 and ultrasound= 1/25 (p value < 0.01). Dogs with heterogeneous contrast enhancement were significantly more likely to have portal vein thrombosis (p value <0.01). This study suggests that dogs with acute pancreatitis and heterogeneous pancreatic contrast enhancement may be predisposed to portal vein thromboses and that CTA more accurately identified these findings.",

The deleterious actions of PGE2 are inhibited in varying degrees byNon\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, administration of these drugs also leads to significant gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Grapiprant is a new anti\u2010inflammatory drug from the piprant class that functions as a selective EP4 prostaglandin\u2010receptor (EP4R) inhibitor and is proposed to be associated with less GI side effects. The aim of this study was to determine the value of canine jejunal tissue as well as a novel in vitro 3\u2010dimensional model of canine intestinal epithelium (enteroids) for future in vitro and ex\u2010vivo investigation of possible GI side effects of drugs in the priprant class. Briefly, ten\u2010centimeter tissue pieces were acquired from the jejunum of 7 healthy dogs which had been euthanized for an unrelated project. Full thickness tissues were fixed in 10% formalin saline, routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. For enteroid culture, minced samples were washed and crypts were enriched, using EDTA chelation, embedded in matrigel, and grown in intestinal stem cell media until full epithelial differentiation (day 7 of culture). RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope\u00d2, ACDBio) was used to evaluate full thickness samples of canine healthy jejunum as well as enteroids derived from the same tissues. To quantify RNAscope\u00d2 signals in tissue sections, an advanced digital pathology image analysis system (HALO, Indica Labs) was utilized. Data was expressed as copy number for EP4R with that signal compared to the housekeeping target (B\u2010actin, positive control gene). In 7/7 jejunal samples evaluated, universal positive expression of EP4R was identified in the epithelium as well as in lamina propria immune cells (copy number 0.1 to 2.6 on average per cell). Expression of EP4 in enteroids showed similar expression in the epithelium when compared to epithelial expression in full thickness samples (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=0.6).",

A 5\u2010point BCS scale was defined by the ideal body weight (IBW ) and current body weight (BW) as follows: BCS of 5, BW > IBW\u00d71.21; BCS of 4, BW= IBW \u00d71.11 to 1.20; BCS of 3, BW = IBW \u00d70.91 to 1.10; BCS of 2, BW = IBW \u00d70.90 to 0.81; and BCS of 1, BW < IBW \u00d70.80. The correlation between body length and IBW was examined by Pearson's correlation coefficient test.",

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be beneficial on the treatment of heart failure (HF), due to arterial vasodilator effect, but the adverse effects in patients with MMVD are unclear. The aim of this study is evaluate the adverse effects of amlodipine on the treatment of dogs with MMVD stage C. This is a clinical trial randomized double\u2010blinded placebo\u2010control study, that all dogs receive conventional therapy to MMVD stage C (furosemide, spironolactone, enalapril and pimobendan), and randomized in two groups: amlodipine or placebo. The amlodipine mean dose is 0.3 mg/kg once a day. The dogs are followed during 10 months, with clinical assessment, echocardiogram, measurement of systemic arterial blood pressure (SABP) and serum biochemistry. The main side effect of amlodipine is the hypotension that may lead to increase of serum creatinine and BUN, therefore the adverse effects of amlodipine have been assessed by measurement of systolic SABP (by vascular Doppler method) and serum creatinine and BUN. Systolic SABP was measured at the first day of treatment with amlodipine or placebo (T0), seven days (T7D), one month (T1M) and three months (T3M) after the beginning of the treatment. Serum creatinine and BUN were measured at times T0 and T7D. Up to the present time it have already been enrolled 14 dogs in this study. There was no difference in systolic SABP between amlodipine and placebo groups at the four times assessed (p>0.05). There was no difference in systolic SABP in the placebo group among the four times too (p>0.05). The amlodipine group presented a significant increase of systolic SABP between T0 and T7D (p=0.003) and significant decrease between T1M and T3M (p=0.003). No dog (of the both groups) presented hypotension (systolic SABP < 90 mmHg) in the four times of evaluation. Creatinine and BUN serum values didn't present difference in the amlodipine group between T0 and T7D (p>0.05) and the same result was observed in the placebo group (p>0.05). There was also no difference to creatinine and BUN values between the groups for T0 and T7D (p>0.05). This preliminary results showed that amlodipine at the used dose don't induce hypotension or decrease of systolic SABP when compared to placebo group, and don't increase serum creatinine and BUN values during the seven first days of treatment.",

The aim of the present descriptive study was to assess echocardiographic changes indicative of PH and outcome in dogs treated for angiostrongylosis. Dogs with a positive Angio\u2010detect (IDEXX) or Bearmann analysis and echocardiography performed at diagnosis (T0) were retrospectively included (n=23, median age 1.9years, range 0.3\u201315.8). After treatment, follow\u2010up echocardiography was performed in 16 dogs either within short\u2010term (n=12) (< 5months after diagnosis; median 1month) (T1) and/or long\u2010term (n=7) (> 5months; median 15.9months) (T2). Tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG), main pulmonary artery to aorta ratio (MPA/Ao), right pulmonary vein to pulmonary artery ratio (PV/PA), right pulmonary distensibility index (RPAD), and acceleration to ejection time ratio of the pulmonary flow (AT:ET) were retrospectively measured and compared over time using a mixed linear model. Dogs were treated with fenbendazole for 1 to 21 days (median 7 days) followed by a moxidectin spot\u2010on (n=19). Additionally, 14 dogs received cardiac treatment for PH including sildenafil (n=14), pimobendan (n=5), and furosemide (n=2). A significant improvement of PVPA in M\u2010mode (0.56 at T0 vs. 1.02 at T1 vs. 0.90 at T2, P=0.0002) and in 2D\u2010mode (0.55vs.0.82vs.083, P=0.0031), MPA/Ao (0.95vs.0.80vs.0.83, P=0.03) and AT:ET (0.37vs.0.47vs.0.48, P=0.0005) was observed between T0 and T1 and T0 and T2. Differences were not significant between T1 and T2 for these parameters. There was no significant change for RPAD (21.4vs.29.1vs.23.8%, P=0.385) nor TRPG (76.6vs.49.2mmHg, P=0.0842) over time. TRPG was measured in 16/23 (69.6%) dogs at T0, 7/12 (58.3%) at T1 and 1/7 (14.2%) at T2. TRPG indicated absent, mild, moderate and severe PH in respectively 1 (4.3%), 3 (13%), 2 (8.7%), and 10 (43.5%) dogs at diagnosis. Of 23 dogs included, 17 (74%) were alive at the time of writing, while 6 (26%) died; with all deaths related to cardio\u2010respiratory disease. Individual survival times from these dogs were 1, 3, 36, 93, 148 and 320 days (median 64.5 days) after diagnosis. PH was moderate and severe in 2 and 4 non\u2010survivors respectively. Individual echocardiographic parameters in non\u2010survivors did not improve at short\u2010term recheck (n=3). Results of this study demonstrated a mortality rate of 26% among dogs with angiostrongylosis that underwent an echocardiography at diagnosis. Non\u2010survival seems to be associated with a persistent moderate to severe PH. In general, an improvement of indirect parameters of PH was noted at short\u2010 and long\u2010term rechecks, despite no significant difference for TRPG at short\u2010term.",

Physical examination, blood pressure measurement, and other clinical information (thoracic radiography, echocardiography, and/or previous diagnosis) obtained from their medical records were used to determine the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. The environmental information of the dogs\u2019 households (the presence/absence of indoor air pollution, ambient temperature, and household humidity) was obtained from the database of a previous project involving an indoor air pollution survey. Forty\u2010seven dogs with cardiovascular disease (chronic valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertention, aortic insufficiency, arrhythmia, or borderline/sustained systemic hypertension) and 56 control dogs were compared. Except for household humidity (64.8% vs 68.3%, P = 0.048), exposure to several well\u2010known indoor air pollutants (second\u2010hand smoke, P = 0.72; cooking fumes, P = 0.29; incense burning, P = 0.61), the average PM2.5 concentration in the pet house (P = 0.53), and ambient temperature (P = 0.054) were not statistically different between dogs with and without cardiovascular disease. Among signalment factors, dogs with cardiovascular disease were significantly older (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be overweight (BCS \u22657/9) (P = 0.013) than control dogs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed aging (adjust OR = 1.27, P = 0.004) and overweight (adjust OR = 4.34, P = 0.017) were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in dogs. In conclusion, the association between environmental hazards and cardiovascular disease was not found in pet dogs.",

This leads to MV regurgitation, which is clinically detected as a left apical systolic heart murmur, the intensity of which is classically classified according to a 6\u2010grade scheme. Past studies have shown that an increase in heart murmur intensity over time is associated with worsening of DMVD lesions, with thrilling murmurs (TM, i.e., of grade V/VI and VI/VI) associated with more severe disease. The objectives of this retrospective study were to characterize the epidemiological, clinical, and echocardiographic features of dogs with TM related to DMVD, and to identify parameters associated with survival. The case records of small\u2010breed dogs (under 15 kg) diagnosed with TM related to DMVD were reviewed. The study population consisted of 374 dogs (median age at detection of TM=10.7 years [IQR=8.6\u201012.5], male\u2010to\u2010female ratio=1.8). The most represented breeds were Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Yorkshire Terrier, Poodle and Chihuahua. Thirty\u2010six dogs had a concurrent hemodynamically compromised systemic or cardiac disease and were therefore excluded from the subsequent analysis. According to the ACVIM classification, 24%(82/338) were in stage B2, 61% (207/338) in stage C and 7% (22/338) in stage D. Chordae tendineae rupture was identified in 75% (254/338) of the included dogs, severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary arterial pressure >75 mmHg) in 27% (90/337), and tachyarrhythmias in 46% (157/338). Regurgitation fraction (RF), assessed using the PISA method, was >30% for all dogs (median value=70%[IQR=59\u201076]), which is consistent with moderate to severe MV regurgitation.",

During that time, the dogs were worked according to their usual regimen and were fed complete balanced diets once daily between 6pm\u20108pm. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was considered when serum glucose was < 3.5 mmol/L at any point between 12am\u20106am. Nine of 22 dogs (median age 3 years, IQR 2\u20105, range 1\u20108) experienced a median of 4 (IQR 2\u201022, range 1\u201079) hypoglycaemic (<3.5mmol/L) episodes (median total readings 96, IQR 72\u201096, range 72\u201096) of which 6 dogs experienced a median of 2 (IQR 1\u201014, range 1\u201078) severe hypoglycaemic (<2.5mmol/L) episodes (median total readings 96, IQR 78\u201096, range 72\u201096). In 5, 2, and 2 of the dogs, glucose was <3.5mmol/L for 1, 2, and 4 nights, respectively; whereas, in 5 and 1 of the dogs, glucose was <2.5mmol/L for 1 and 4 nights, respectively. One dog with a glucose of <3.5mmol/L and a second dog with a glucose of <2.5mmol/L had 9 and 1 glucose readings > 6.66 mmol/L, respectively.

The suspicion of concomitant infection in half of our cases at hypoadrenocorticism occurrence is an interesting finding. An impaired ability to synthesize cortisol in response to infection might trigger clinical signs appearance in dogs with previously subclinical hypoadrenocorticism.",

A previous study reported concurrent pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) did not affect outcome for dogs undergoing RT. However, as PDH is associated with multiple comorbidities, authors hypothesised dogs with PDH would have poorer survival than those without PDH. This retrospective study recruited dogs who underwent pituitary RT at a single centre between 01/01/2008 and 01/01/2018. Signalment, time to RT post\u2010diagnosis, tumour characteristics, RT protocol and PDH status were recorded. Thirty\u2010one dogs were enrolled: 16 males and 15 females. Median age was 9 years (IQR 4.7) and 14 dogs had PDH; twenty\u2010six underwent definitive RT. Median tumour size was 2.60 cm3 (S.D. 1.47) and median radiation dose was 48 Gy (IQR 4). Follow\u2010up intra\u2010cranial imaging was available for four dogs; all experienced tumour volume reduction (38,45,72 and 78%). Median survival times of patients with and without PDH were 750 (IQR 915) and 709 (IQR 761) days, respectively (Kaplan\u2010Meier log\u2010rank P=0.386). Variables with P<0.2 on univariate Cox regression analysis (gender and age at diagnosis) were included in multivariate analysis to assess patient characteristics associated with survival.

Not all dogs from the WHWT breed develop CIPF, which suggests the involvement of triggering factors in the onset and/or progression of the disease. To assess potential triggers, an online questionnaire\u2013based survey was submitted to WHWTs owners. The questionnaire was accessible during a 3\u2010month period in 3 different languages (English, French, and Dutch) and was distributed to WHWTs owners and breeders through social medial and emails. Questions were divided into sections regarding owner, dog (clinical and diagnostic data for CIPF), environment (house and surroundings, compost, ventilation, air conditioning, humidification, asbestosis, smoking, and household maintenance), grooming, and veterinary care (vaccination, deworming, and comorbidities). Completed questionnaires were received from 458 WHWTs owners from various countries including principally USA (n=193), Australia (n=62), France (n=56), UK (n=39), and Belgium (n=30). Thirty\u2010eight questionnaires were discarded due to lack of essential data resulting in a total amount of 420 exploitable responses, 138 of which concerning a CIPF affected WHWT. Median age reported at CIPF diagnosis was 11.5 years (range 2\u2013 6.8). Inspiratory crackles were noticed in 82.3% of dogs. Seventy\u2010three out of 138 (52.9%) CIPF WHWTs were dead at the time of questionnaire completion. The overall survival time after diagnosis was 1.4 years (0\u20138.5). Cause of death was CIPF\u2010related in 76.7% of cases. In order to assess potential triggers associated with CIPF, each CIPF dog was matched to one unaffected WHWT by age. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used for group comparison (CIPF vs. CTRL). Statistical significance was set at a P\u2010value \u2264 0.05. Parameters significantly associated with CIPF included genetic relationship with another dog affected with CIPF (P=0.025), living in an old house (P=0.012), absence of a ventilation system (P<0.0001), and frequent grooming in dedicated facilities (P=0.001). CIPF dogs were at increased risk of cardiac disease (P=0.001), most likely due to the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension, and at decreased risk of endocrine disease (P=0.01) compared with CTRL. The preliminary results of this survey suggest an association between CIPF, genetic background and environmental factors such as old non\u2010ventilated houses or grooming habits. Further analysis of the results of the questionnaire are ongoing.",

Complete blood count, serum folate and cobalamin concentrations and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were measured in 48 bitches at mid\u2010 and late\u2010pregnancy. The effects of the pregnancy stage, breed, age, parity and breeder on these variables were determined by generalized estimating equation test. Linear correlations between variables were assessed by Pearson's correlation test. Serum cobalamin (mean\u00b1SD) decreased (434\u00b1143 vs. 335\u00b1104; P<0.001), TIBC increased (3.6\u00b10.6 vs. 4.2\u00b10.7; P<0.001), while serum folate decreased insignificantly (13.4\u00b13.5 vs. 12.5\u00b13.3; P=0.1) at late pregnancy. The breed significantly (P<0.001) affected serum cobalamin and folate concentrations and TIBC, while the breeder significantly (P <0.001) affected folate concentration and TIBC. The neutrophil, platelet and leukocyte counts significantly increased, while the red blood cell count (RBC) significantly decreased (P<0.001 for all) at late pregnancy. The decrease in RBC was significantly, albeit weakly, correlated with the serum folate decrease (r=0.33; P=0.023) and the serum TIBC increase (r=0.40; P=0.004). None of the measures was associated with NS. In conclusion, although serum cobalamin had significantly decreased during pregnancy, this decrease was unassociated with PRA or NS. In pregnant bitches, contrary to pregnant women, TIBC increases as pregnancy progresses. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether prophylactic folate administration mitigates PRA, considering the significant correlation between the decreases of serum folate concentration and RBC with progression of pregnancy as noted herein.",

Currently there are no reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of CKD. Since fibrosis is the main tissue alteration during CKD, we assumed that the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u2010\u00df1), an initiation molecule of tissue fibrosis may be used as an early indicator of CKD. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in feline CKD. Twenty\u2010five healthy cats and 26 cats with CKD were included in the study. TGF\u2010\u03b21 was measured in serum using a \u201cQuantikine Human TGF\u2010\u03b21 Immunoassay\u201d (R&D Systems). In healthy cats the median TGF\u2010\u03b21 serum concentration was 27.37 ng/ml, while cats suffering from CKD had a median of 17.62 ng/ml, being the difference between both groups significant (p = 0.0013). CKD affected cats with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 2 had a median TGF\u2010\u03b21 serum concentration of 14.82 ng/ml. Cats with IRIS stage 3 had a median of 15.79 ng/ml and cats with IRIS stage 4 had a median of 19.24 ng/ml. There was no significant correlation between the serum TGF\u2010\u03b21 concentration and the different IRIS\u2010Stages. Furthermore there was no significant correlation between serum TGF\u2010\u03b21 and the platelet count, even though these cells have the highest intracellular concentrations of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in blood. Cats diagnosed with CKD showed lower serum TGF\u2010\u03b21 concentrations than healthy cats. In another study serum TGF\u2010\u03b21 was also higher in healthy cats compared to cats with CKD. A higher expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the kidneys accompanied by a higher synthesis of extracellular matrix can be detected histologically in humans. A missing rise of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in serum of cats with CKD could be attributed to the fact that this cytokine is synthesised directly in the kidneys for local fibrosis processes. The possible use of serum TGF\u2010\u03b21 as a diagnostic tool for CKD could not be validated in this study.",

The primary aim of the study is to identify and to assess the evidence which relates to the clinical efficacy of marbofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections in small animal practice. 118 dogs and 123 cats were referred to Internal Medicine Department Polyclinics with lower urinary tract symptoms whom hadn't received antimicrobial or anti\u2010inflammatory therapy previous 15 days, were included in the study. The diagnosis was confirmed by clinical findings, urinalysis and imaging. Rectal temperature, appetite, urinary signs and pain on abdominal palpation were monitored at two visits (day 0 and day 14). The timetable depending on diagnosis: two urinalyses and two bacterial examinations and antibacterial susceptibility testing per case were performed. Bacterial UTI were confirmed of 36 dogs and 28 cats. Urine samples were collected on the first referral demonstrated the presence of various bacteria with a marked predominance of P. mirabilis and coagulase positive Staphylococci in canine and feline urine samples, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results revealed 25 (65.7%) of dog isolates and 24 (85.7%) of cat isolates were susceptible to marbofloxacin. Treatment of UTIs is generally challenging for the small animal practitioner. Because of long\u2010term antimicrobial usage necessity, especially bacterial culture and susceptibility test are very important for treatment success. Marbofloxacin usage can be rewarding in the treatment of UTIs in dogs and cats. Thus, revealed the current status of Turkey for the first time.

Consequently, a compensatory increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is expected. The latter has not been documented, and we hypothesized that glucosuria would increase GFR and aimed to measure the GFR in a model of isolated renal glycosuria. We randomized eight cats in a crossover design to receive 10 mg dapagliflozin (a type\u20102 sodium glucose transporter inhibitor) or sham\u2010treatment over four, 5\u2010day treatment periods that were separated by 7\u2010day washout periods. We assessed GFR and total body water content (TBWC) via iohexol clearance and deuterium\u2010oxide tracer dilution method, respectively. The study had a power of 90% to detect a difference of 20\u00b115 mL in daily urine output. We analyzed the results with a mixed effect model that included treatment and period of treatment as fixed effects. To control for the effect of repeated measures on the same cat, a random intercept for cat and an autoregressive process of order\u20101 correlation structure were fitted. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Dapagliflozin induced profound glucosuria without an increase in daily urine output. The mean (\u00b1SE) iohexol clearance was 3.5\u00b10.3 and 4.2\u00b10.2 for the nontreated and sham\u2010treated cats, respectively (P 0.003). The mean (\u00b1SE) TBWC, normalized to body weight, was 65.1\u00b12.4% and 64.1\u00b11.2%, for the sham\u2010treated and treated cats, respectively (P 0.43). We conclude that in this model, the observed increase in GFR is associated with a concomitant preservation of TBWC.",

Extragenital CTVT can be located on the skin, in the nasal and oral cavity, metastasize lungs and regional lymph nodes. The largest previously published study of nasal CTVT included an analysis of 6 cases. The aim of the study was to analyze and describe the clinical manifestations and response to therapy in patients with the nasal form of CTVT. 11 dogs with a naturally occurring CTVT were included in a retrospective study. Patients entered treatment from different regions of Ukraine and received therapy at the Zoovetservis clinic in Kiew in 2013\u20102017. All patients entered with visualized neoplasms, the diagnosis was made on the basis of cytological (in 4 cases additionally histology) investigations. 8 males and 3 females were included in the study. All of them were not neutered at the time of CTVT detection. None of the patients had genital CTVT lesions, 3 patients had owner, 8 stray dogs had guardians, 2 dogs were breed (bichon, spaniel), 9 dogs were mixbreed. The clinical symptoms of nasal TVT included: sneezing, epistaxis, unilateral or bilateral purulent hemorrhagic discharge from the nose (in all 11 patients), hard skull infiltration and the formation of oronosal fistulas were observed in 9 of 11 patients. In 5 patients, skin fistulas were observed on the back of the nose, all of them spontaneously disappeared after treatment with CTVT. None of the patients had a CTVT planum nasals lesion. All dogs received monochemotherapy with vincristine weekly at a dosage of 0.7 mg / m2. The course consisted of 4\u20109 cycles. In patients with oronasal fistulas sneezing and discharge were maintained until the resolution of fistulas with negative cytological control. None of the patients had hematologic toxicity requiring the transfer of chemotherapy. 11 dogs responded to therapy with complete clinical remission. In 10 dogs a year later there was no relapse. There is no information about one dog (3 months after the treatment there was no relapse).",

Cases were treated using Bleomycin (15000 iu/sq m) intravenously with electroporation using either a Cytopulse PA 2000 or Cytopulse Oncovet signal generator, 8 pulses of 1000 V/cm at either 1 Hz or 5MHz applied starting 8 minutes after drug administration. Treatments were applied under general anaesthesia. ECT was applied either as sole therapy (n=42), to tumour margins during surgery (intra\u2010operative, n=8) or to surgical scars roughly 2 weeks after surgery (adjuvant, n=9) whilst one case was initially treated by sole therapy with repeat during surgery. Two patients received second treatments whilst 58 received only a single treatment. All treatments were applied using Gehl array electrodes, two rows of needles 6 mm apart. Intra\u2010operative treatment was applied after cytoreduction with no attempt to excise margins: in some cases some macroscopic tumour was present in the treated volume. Mast cell tumour cases receiving sole therapy ECT showed 10/12 (83.3%) enduring CR and those receiving intra\u2010operative or adjuvant ECT showed 6/7 (85.7%) disease\u2010free at censoring. Response to ECT of squamous cell carcinoma showed dependency on site. Those in the premaxilla or external nares (n=3) showing no responses. In other (all oral) lesions (n=12), 7 CR (58.3%), PR 3 (25%) and 2 surgically removed before ECT. Of these, 1 CR recurred and was treated for a second time leading to disease\u2010free state at censorship, 3 PR recurred. Results for spindle cell tumours were disappointing: one small fibrosarcoma showing CR after sole therapy and overall response (CR and disease control) 5/12 (41.6%). Ameloblastomas and epulides showed 100% CR after sole therapy (n=5). Melanomas gave relatively poor results (25% CR to sole therapy \u2013 n=4). ECT showed good results in mast cell tumours and fair results in oral squamous cell carcinomas not involving the rostral portion of the mouth. Cosmetic and functional results were excellent with some scarring apparent in cases where skin was treated. Healing of oral lesions, even where bone was exposed, was rapid and complete.",

None of the dogs were associated with dog fighting. The most common clinical signs observed in dogs were inappetence, apathy, pale mucous membranes, discoloration of urine, splenomegaly and hyperthermia. The predominant hematological abnormality was anemia (49 out of 60 dogs) (81.7%). The severity of anemia ranged from 18.3 % (11 of 60 dogs), 11.7 % (7/60), 30 % (18/60), 21.7 % (13/60) and 18.3 % (11/60) corresponding to the category of non\u2010anemia (HCT >37), mild (30 \u2264 HCT <37), moderate (20 \u2264 HCT <30), severe (13 \u2264 HCT <20), and very severe (HCT <13), respectively. Seventy percent of the dogs (42/60) carried an HCT of less then 30, whereas 40% (24/60) of the dogs had a life\u2010threatening HCT below 20. Regenerative anemia was observed in 66.7% (38/57), whereas non\u2010regenerative anemia occurred in 32.2% (11/57) of the cases, respectively.
