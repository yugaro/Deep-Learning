The One Health (OH) approach to research addresses questions at the intersections of human, animal, and environmental health by utilizing the expert knowledge of researchers, including public health practitioners and clinicians, from multiple disciplines and at local, national, and global levels. While the need for multidisciplinary research is not new, the concept of OH has gained momentum as researchers from human medicine, public health, veterinary medicine, urban planning, and environmental science increasingly focus on holistic, integrated approaches to complex questions that address human health in conjunction with animal and environmental health [1].",

By looking at multiple dimensions of the problem through the lens of environmental, animal, and human health, researchers may discover influencing factors that they would not have otherwise seen, which can facilitate more informed intervention design. In 2015, the World Health Organization designated 11 diseases as high risk for severe outbreak, ten of which have a zoonotic reservoir or transmission vector [2]. An OH approach to studying these diseases may be able to provide more complete information about opportunities for outbreak prevention than a traditional one-dimensional approach. For example, a Lassa fever prevention intervention which targets the environmental (e.g. improved household sanitation) and animal (e.g. rodent removal) domains may show promise, but omission of the human domain (e.g. education of nurses on disposal of contaminated material in hospitals) may result in a missed opportunity to achieve optimum results. At worst, siloed approaches may lead to unforeseen detrimental effects. In the Lassa fever example, removal of rodent populations may result in increased malnutrition among humans if rodents were a significant direct or indirect (i.e. prey for larger food source animals) source of protein for families living in affected communities. The ultimate goal of OH research is to identify opportunities for health improvement and optimize risk mitigation simultaneously across all three domains [3].",

In this phase, it may be helpful to draw upon the expertise of research collaborators and relevant literature to inform the development of a diagram or chart of these relationships. For example, a Directed Acyclic Graph could be used to visualize exposure-outcome pathways and identify important covariables and confounders [8]. Or, a logic model or similar multi-pathway visualization matrix may also be helpful for deciding where in the pathway to intervene and for brainstorming the potential impacts of the intervention on animal, human, and environmental health. For example, a graphing exercise may help the research team anticipate downstream factors of a vector control program that should be measured to both determine the program's effectiveness (e.g. reduced number of vector-borne illnesses) and to evaluate any adverse outcomes associated with the intervention (e.g. impact of mosquito fumigation on local flora and fauna or human respiratory illness associated with exposure to fumigation). Hypotheses and study aims can be based on the findings of this graphing process.",

Researchers may look inside their own institutions or externally for relevant expertise. In the team-building phase, it is important to present the research question to a wide and varied audience to uncover perspectives far outside one's own field that may be unexpectedly relevant to the question at hand. Given the diversity of topics covered in the OH approach, study teams may benefit from involvement of, for example, epidemiologists, veterinarians, ecologists, urban planners, structural and environmental engineers, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, geospatial scientists, botanists, parasitologists, and microbiologists, among others. Early involvement of specialists from each domain will encourage broader thinking in the planning process and will facilitate the aggregation of resources available in each domain, such as funding, staff, and data. Researchers may also consider involvement of community members who have on-the-ground experience with the issue in question, such as farmers, fisherman, park rangers, scuba divers, wildfire firefighters, plant workers, and community members who live near potential exposure sites. Involvement of community members is likely to enhance the research team's ability to collect new data and to understand the context of the data.",

The OH approach may draw from a range of study designs which are utilized in multiple disciplines, including, for example, prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, genome-wide association, randomized control trial, case series, natural experiments, twin studies, risk assessment or risk analyses, experimental studies, and ecological studies. Due to the complexity of the OH research approach, the overall study design may be a combination of these. For example, a retrospective ecological evaluation of arboviral disease incidence in relation to deforestation patterns could be combined with a prospective natural experiment to assess changes in arboviral disease trends in reforested areas compared to those with continued deforestation. The integrated nature of the OH approach to research also lends itself to mixed data collection methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative human data, environmental samples, and animal behavior observational records. For example, a study of the impacts of groundwater contamination may combine serial readings from groundwater monitoring wells, geospatial modeling of contaminant plumes, evaluation of toxin concentration levels in fish, interviews with residents about perceived drinking water quality, aerial satellite imagery, and longitudinal surveys of residents or health registry data to evaluate health impacts associated with groundwater contamination.",

Power computation at an early phase may help avert decisions which would otherwise result in collection of insufficient data to adequately address the most important questions. Power may also be computed mid-study (interim power) to incorporate existing data and trends, and to ensure that the existing data collection plan is sufficient to address the OH questions in light of interim trends.",

Geo-coded data, such as the Gridded Livestock of the World database from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [11], provide complementary information to augment analyses.

In addition, risks associated with other exposure pathways, i.e. via air or contact with soil, could be evaluated in conjunction with ingestion-related risk to estimate total risk. This case study illustrates that consideration of connections among environmental, animal and human health facilitates a more comprehensive health risk assessment which has the ability to reflect cumulative exposures.",

Scientific expertise across multiple disciplines informed the development of diagrams describing the pathways through which the agricultural use of biosolids could impact the health of the environment, animals, and humans. Using these diagrams, the research team generated hypotheses about the possible contamination pathways and associations between biosolid use and human and environmental risk which were tested using simulation models, a methodology that transcends disciplines. In our example, model parameters were obtained from a variety of sources across all three domains of animal, human, and environmental health. Because the study evaluated human impact from exposure via contamination of environmental media, produce, and animal components, the research team was able to interpret results from multi-pathway models to assess total potential hazard to humans. By incorporating information from the animal, human, and environmental domains into the study design, this research generated far more information about exposure routes and hazard levels than would have been observed using a siloed or even two-domain (e.g. human-environment) approach.",

In a rapidly industrializing world, vector-borne disease prevention and control cannot be addressed without consideration of the impact of natural and man-made environmental changes on patterns of disease vector proliferation. The field of climate change research represents an excellent opportunity for researchers to work across disciplines to integrate diverse data sources, develop cross-cutting methodologies, and answer questions about the broader effects of environmental health on human health and animal welfare. Another emerging field of multidisciplinary health and scientific research is Planetary Health [26]. The Planetary Health discipline acknowledges that the preservation of natural systems are an integral part of human survival and prosperity. This same philosophy underlies the One Health approach, and promotes growth and innovation in processes, policies, and technologies that promote conservation and informed stewardship of the natural environment.",

These challenges include, but are not limited to, the need for improved collaborations across disciplines and administrative barriers, improved science-based risk management policies, and improved manpower and research infrastructure capacity in developing countries in particular [27]. In addition, significant challenges to conducting OH research may also arise if funding agencies do not provide effective mechanisms to support interdisciplinary OH research [1]. Though many have argued in favor of trans-disciplinary research [24], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], ecological and veterinary science remain largely segregated from human health research [33]. The OH approach to research will continue to advance through demonstration of effective collaboration with key stakeholders. Although progress has been made to foster OH research networks [3], [34], [35], [36], funding agencies in various sectors should do more to encourage collaborative work across the disciplines of human and ecological health. Encouraging these multidisciplinary research efforts, especially at the conception and planning phases, will help scientists develop innovative solutions to complex and inter-related human, animal, and environmental health threats.",
