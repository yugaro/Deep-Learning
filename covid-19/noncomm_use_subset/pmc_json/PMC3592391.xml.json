            "text": "Massively parallel sequencing allows for rapid and low-cost deep sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to gain greater insight into viral evolution, fitness, emergence and transmission. Currently, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers designed to amplify specific viral RNA sequences is the most common method for amplifying RNA viruses prior to sequencing and other downstream applications. Recent studies have used both 454 (1\u201311) (Newman et al., manuscript submitted) and Illumina (12\u201314) sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons for RNA viruses. However, standard RT-PCR methods are not adequate for the generation of templates suitable for sequencing low-copy viral RNA samples, where labor-intensive methods such as nested PCR (15) or single-genome amplification (SGA) (16,17) are typically required. Examples of low-copy viral RNA samples include the following: HIV controllers (capable of controlling the virus in the absence of antiretroviral therapy) (18), dengue virus (DENV) clinical samples collected after peak viremia (19), and West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance samples (20). Obtaining genomic sequence from such samples can provide valuable insights into viral attenuation, response to host immune pressure and drug treatment during infection, disease severity, transmission and epidemic spread.",

This allows sequencing of viral genomes with little or no genomic information and of highly divergent viruses for which robust primers targeting conserved regions are difficult to design. To date these methods have difficulty with sequencing complete genomes from clinical samples due to high levels of host contamination and low viral amounts. The SISPA method described by Djikeng et al. is capable of capturing complete genomes from viral RNA samples, but requires high viral amounts and removal of host RNA contamination with RNases prior to viral RNA extraction (22). Work by Victoria et al. demonstrated the ability to capture complete genomes from stool samples, but it appears these samples had high viral titers (25). Recent work by Ninomiya et al. has demonstrated success of capturing hepatitis C virus (HCV) total RNA sequencing from clinical samples (23), but this method required 200 ng of input RNA which exceeds the amount typically present in most clinical samples. Moore et al. evaluated the sensitivity of detection of infectious agents using RNA sequencing (24). Their method worked well for detecting low amounts of virus but was limited to input amounts of 30,000 copies of viral RNA per sample.",

NL4-3 (28) virus stocks were produced by transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with plasmid DNA encoding a full-length infectious HIV RNA using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to a modified manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, 2.8 \u00d7 106 cells were seeded in a T75 flask. For the transfection, 15 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA, at a minimum concentration of 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l, was diluted to a 150-\u00b5l final volume in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium without supplements; 115 \u00b5l of Polyfect reagent was added, and the solution was mixed by gentle pipetting and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. During the incubation, medium was removed from the cells to be transfected followed by a single wash with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then 7 ml of fresh medium was added. After this incubation, the transfection mixture was transferred to the flask, swirled gently to mix, and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The medium was removed and discarded; the cells were washed once with cold PBS, and 7 ml of fresh medium was added before returning the cells to the incubator.

Viral RNA was isolated using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol with the exception that 5 \u00b5g of linear polyacrylamide (Life Technologies) was used as the carrier instead of the carrier RNA provided with the kit. Viral RNA was eluted with 60 \u00b5l of AVE buffer, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All viral samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Life Technologies) using the manufacturer\u2019s rigorous treatment to ensure removal of DNA. For each HIV sample, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the number of copies of HIV. These experiments were performed with the ABI 7900HT (Life Technologies) using HIV-1 gag SK145 (AGTGGGGGGACATCAAGCAGCCATGCAAAT) and SK431 (TGCTATGTCACTTCCCCTTGGTTCTCT) primers (31) at 300 nM final concentration and the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The quantification standards consisted of linear HIV-1 pNL4-3 plasmid. Similarly to HIV, the number of WNV copies in each sample was also quantified by qRT-PCR performed on the ABI 7900HT using forward primer (TCAGCGATCTCTCCACCAAAG), reverse primer (GGGTCAGCACGTTTGTCATTG), probe (FAM-TGCCCGACCATGGGAGAAGCTC-TAMRA) and the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol and previously described methods (32). In addition, the number of RSV copies in each sample was also quantified by qRT-PCR performed on the ABI 7900HT using forward primer (CATCCAGCAAATACACCATCCA), reverse primer (TTCTGCACATCATAATTAGGAGTATCAA), probe (FAM-CGGAGCACAGGAGAT-TAMRA) and the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol and previously described methods (33). Host 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was quantified for all samples using the ABI 7900HT and the TaqMan ribosomal RNA primer and probes following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Life Technologies).",

To analyse input data composition, we first employed an efficient Illumina aligner BWA-v0.5.9 (26) by aligning reads to viral and host reference genomes. For HIV clone and clinical samples, the reference genomes used were the concatenation of the human genome assembly (NCBI36/hg18), human rRNA sequences (NR_003286.1, NR_003287.1, V00589.1, NR_003285.2, gi|251831106:648-1601, gi|251831106:1671-3229) and the HIV HXB2 sequence (K03455.1). For WNV clone samples, the reference genomes used were the concatenation of preliminary and unpublished sequencing data from the golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, (K. Lindblad-Toh, personal communication), hamster rRNA sequences (NR_045212.1, NR_045133.1, NR_045213.1, D89009.1, DQ334843.1) and WNV NY99 reference (NC_009942.1).

The alignment was carried out by first aligning each read independently using command: bwa aln (-q 5 -l 32 -k 2 -t 4 -o 1), then the read pair information was used by invoking command: bwa sampe (-a 100 000). MergeBamAlignments, from the picard package (v1.59) [http://picard.sourceforge.net/], were used to return the unmapped reads to the aligned BAM file. A custom script was used to count the number of reads aligning to each of the concatenated references. Compared with the BWA aligner, the Mosaik aligner (version 1.1.0013) (http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik) is slower but more accurate when aligning relatively long Illumina reads like the ones used in the current studies. To determine more accurate coverage information for our viral samples only, we used Mosaik (MosaikAligner -st illumina -hs 10 -act 15 -bw 29 -mmp 0.25 -minp 0.25) to align reads to the target viral reference genome and the consensus assembly results. Primer sequences were not trimmed since soft-clipping is tolerated by Mosaik.",

In short, VICUNA used the Ovation RNA-Seq primer sequence (inferred from several input datasets) for read trimming. Low complexity reads were discarded. Since some of the HIV, RSV and WNV datasets contained a large percentage of reads derived from the host, we invoked the optional target genome filter component of VICUNA. Based on sequence similarity, the remaining reads were clustered to form contigs, which were further validated such that each read in the contig had sufficient similarity compared with the consensus. Guided by paired reads, these contigs were compared using an efficient alignment algorithm. Any two contigs that shared a significant suffix\u2013prefix overlap were merged. The assembly process terminated when no further merging could be applied. In several cases, a viral reference genome was used to further extend the assembly. Briefly, raw contigs of >350 bases obtained by the assembler were aligned to a reference using MUSCLE (version 3.8) (38). Each contig was broken down in segments when there was a deletion of 30 or more nucleotides compared with the reference. The contigs were added to form the final assembly in decreasing order of length until either the whole assembly was covered or no contigs remained. Overlapping segments were merged together by concatenating the nucleotide sequence of each segment at the central position of overlap.",

First, the majority of reads (>95%) contained a partial (>9 bp) Ovation RNA-Seq SPIA (single primer isothermal amplification) primer, which often appears in the start of the read. Second, a substantial fraction (up to 25%) of the reads did not align to the viral or host references. With a fraction of the unaligned reads (50 000), we used MEGAN to identify the composition of unaligned reads for the HIV and WNV clones (Supplementary Figure S3). For the HIV clone, the read composition was: 12% bacterial, 3% eukaryotic, 4% retrovirus, 33% not assigned and 48% no hit. The retrovirus hits were unaligned HIV sequences. The majority of the not assigned reads were bacterial rRNA and HIV hits that could not be classified to specific taxonomical group. The no hit reads were mostly simple sequence repeats and SPIA primer sequences. The high abundance of these reads might be due to the low input amounts, which led to the greater abundance of these non-specific by-products. For the WNV clone, the read composition was: 0.5% bacterial, 3% eukaryotic, 0.5% flavivirus, 2% not assigned and 95% no hit. The eukaryotic hits were mostly rat and mouse. The flavivirus hits were unaligned WNV sequences. Some of the no hits for WNV clone were simple sequence repeats and SPIA primer, but the majority of the no hit reads for WNV could not be identified as similar to known sequences.

For both HIV clone and clinical samples, version 2 had more even coverage than version 1 (Figure 1B) based on a lower coefficient of variation (CV) (Supplementary Table S3). More even coverage is highly desirable for sequencing viral samples and other applications; therefore the version 2 system would be the preferred system.\n",

To further evaluate the reproducibility of the method, we examined the nucleotide composition differences (Table 2) between any two assemblies. At each mismatch residue, the consensus base in the first assembly was considered to be consistent with the consensus base in the second assembly if the mismatch was supported by read alignments in the second assembly (Composition mismatches in Table 2).

For several reasons, these conditions are not ideal for sequencing from clinical samples. First, most clinical samples contain a few picograms or less of viral RNA. In our study, we were able to study viral samples with femtogram and attogram amounts of viral RNA (over 1 million times less material than had been previously used) as input to the Ovation RNA-Seq system and generate sufficient dsDNA for Illumina sequencing. Second, ex vivo amplification is laborious and could lead to bias in sample generation during the 9 days in culture. We were able to capture complete sequence coverage of the CDS directly from clinical samples therefore generating sequence data more representative of the dominant viral genome within the infected individual. Third, we utilized a recently developed de novo genome assembly algorithm, VICUNA, to assemble a full-length consensus (Yang et al., manuscript submitted). Previous studies have shown (10,41) that de novo assembly can significantly improve the accuracy of assembly and utilization of data compared with reference-based assembly approaches.

In our Ovation RNA-Seq experiments, <37% of the total reads from HIV and RSV clinical samples aligned to rRNA (Table 1).

It does not require prior viral sequence knowledge for primer design enabling the study of viruses with limited sequence data. The lack of viral-specific primers allows for identification of viral recombinants that might not be found with standard RT-PCR methods. Our method is capable of amplifying viral RNA genomes that are not successful by traditional RT-PCR methods. For HIV clinical sample B, four RT-PCR attempts were not successful in capturing the CDS, but in all six attempts with our method 97\u2013100% of the CDS was captured (Table 1). Furthermore, this method is easily applicable to multiple sample types. We applied the method to HIV, RSV and WNV samples without the need for optimization. Developing a robust RT-PCR process with viral specific primers can require a significant effort, up to several months (unpublished results), so that our method potentially speeds up viral genome sequencing projects. This method works with a highly variable virus such as HIV\u2014capturing the entire CDS of the genome starting from only 100 viral genomes (Table 1). In addition, the process from viral RNA to dsDNA requires only 4.5 hours. Furthermore if this method were coupled with Nextera Illumina library construction (45), one could generate an Illumina library in less than a single day. Although the Nextera method is very fast, the transposase-based method of Illumina library construction may introduce GC-bias compared with standard methods (46). As only 5 million reads were necessary to assemble complete viral genomes, MiSeq or Ion Torrent sequencing (47) could be used. This would allow a researcher to go from sample to sequence data in less than a week. Finally, the Ovation RNA-Seq method is available in automated format allowing for high-throughput processing of clinical samples. As only 5 million reads are needed per sample, one could pool up to 96 samples per lane of HiSeq2000.",

            "text": "The methods described here have several promising applications. The sequence-independent amplification methods coupled with our de novo assembly of viral genomes provides a new methodology for sequencing viral genomes from many different sample types. These methods can generate next-generation sequencing data of pathogens allowing for greater insight into pathogen evolution, fitness, emergence and transmission as well as factors that are important for the development of new therapeutics and vaccines. In addition, these methods could be used to discover known or unknown pathogens in clinical samples, not limited to viruses. Likewise, these methods could also be used for surveillance to detect viral RNA from environmental sources, such as WNV in mosquito samples. This surveillance ability could provide valuable insight into what pathogens are circulating and provide an \u201cearly warning\u201d of future outbreaks (48). Additionally, one would be able to identify and study multiple viruses from a single sample. This could be beneficial in understanding the dynamics of viral co-infection, such as HIV/HCV. Furthermore, these methods could be applied to parasite, bacterial and fungal pathogen discovery by sequencing total RNA that contains expressed pathogen RNA. Expressed pathogens could be discovered incidentally through RNA-Seq data. Additionally, it may be more cost effective for some projects to sequence RNA rather than DNA to detect pathogens because greater sequencing depth may be needed for DNA than RNA (24). Morin et al. have demonstrated the capability of detecting expressed pathogen RNA through RNA sequencing (49).",
