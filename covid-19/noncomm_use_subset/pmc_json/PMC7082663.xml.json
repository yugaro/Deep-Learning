Most of the initial cases had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, and some cases rendered a family clustering feature. The source of infection is still unknown, however it is speculated that the infection may have been caused by bats or vipers (8). The infection is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The median time from onset to admission to the hospital was 9 days, and most patients were between 40 and 60 years-old. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with gradual dyspnea in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases (239). In this case, the patient had no clear history of contact with the epidemic area, and both the leukocytes and lymphocytes were normal, thus it was misdiagnosed as common pneumonia at first.",
