The idea of the screening parameters is to make the stem cell product safe. Recent introduction of the Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has even brought down the window period to as less as 6 days. In the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), efforts are being made to screen all donors for infectious diseases. Recently, the NAT testing has become mandatory by the American Association of Blood Bank (AABB), knowing that earlier samples were screened by serological parameters only. The infectious disease screening was done as per the AABB standards 5.8.4 & 5.8.5.12 Infectious disease screening has also been necessitated by the US FDA as per their standards 21 CFR 610.40(d).13 All samples that are pending Infectious disease screening results have to be quarantined thus minimizing the chances of cross contamination with the eligible donors. This study highlights prevention strategies due to infectious disease screening among HSCT donors as periodic recommendations and guidelines of the CDC, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). We aim to highlight the effectiveness of disease screening in the elimination of the prevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases among HSCT donors.",

There is an almost equal number of autologous and allogeneic units that have been collected of which around 49% are allogeneic donors. We analyzed the data from the infectious disease screening and ascertained that 7.6% of units stored were from donors who were tested positive during the infectious disease screening. We analyzed the infected donors in each of the infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis, CMV-IgM and Syphilis. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV as per the NAT testing protocol. We next tested the number of donors that showed a positive result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). As per FACT and AABB guidelines (12), donors that are seropositive for HBsAg are permanently deferred to donate. 3 autologous donors (1.1%) who were found to be positive for HBsAg. Autologous donors are acceptable provided the stem cell units are segregated from other tested samples. We analyzed more common antibody detection for Hepatitis (HBc or Hepatitis B core antibody). This antibody can result at the onset of symptoms in acute hepatitis B that persist for life. Anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus. We have observed that the donors who were HBc antibody positive were negative for HBsAg or Hepatitis test done by NAT assay. This also indicates that all the patients had no current Hepatitis incidence. This indicates that either the infection is resolved or it is a false positive result for Hepatitis B. We do not have the data for anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibodies) in order to indicate whether the presence of HBc antibodies is due to any recent vaccination. We next analyzed the prevalence of Hepatitis C antibody in the donors recruited for stem cell transplant. There was a single autologous case (0.38%) where there was a positive indication for Hepatitis C virus. This was confirmed by the NAT testing protocol. We found 2 autologous cases (0.76%) of CMV-IgM. The Hepatitis C and CMV-IgM samples were also quarantined from the other stem cells stored and used for autologous administration only.",
