AECOPD are highly relevant clinically, being a major cause of COPD-related morbidity and mortality,7\u201311 as well as accounting for a substantial proportion of the significant social, healthcare and economic burden of COPD.6 It has been estimated that AECOPD account for approximately 70% of total healthcare costs associated with COPD.12 Patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II disease or greater experience one or two exacerbations annually. Exacerbation varies from patient to patient with severity of disease.13 Various triggers for AECOPD have been identified1; however, up to 75% of all exacerbations are associated with the detection of bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens.14\n15 Exacerbations associated with detectable respiratory pathogens have been shown to have a more marked impact on lung function and longer duration of hospitalisation than exacerbations of non-infectious aetiology.14",

There is increasing evidence that the lower respiratory tract contains a diverse microbial flora that differs between health and disease.16\u201320 The presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the inflamed airways of patients with COPD is well documented, with up to 50% of patients with stable COPD showing evidence of lower airway bacterial colonisation using traditional culture techniques.15\n21\n22 In patients with COPD, bacterial detection in lower airway derived samples is associated with increased airway inflammation, reduced lung function and more frequent exacerbations.23\u201325 Acquisition of new pathogen strains also appears to be associated with an increased risk of AECOPD.15\n21\n26 Estimates of the relative contribution of different pathogens to AECOPD vary. However, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae appears to be the major bacterial pathogen associated with AECOPD, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.14\n15 Respiratory viruses commonly associated with AECOPD are diverse and include human rhinoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus and adenovirus.15",

The selection of participants with a history of at least a single exacerbation enriches the cohort to some degree and ensures an adequate number of exacerbations are sampled. It is accepted that some aspects of the analysis may not be generalisable to the subgroup of patients who never exacerbate. The analyses proposed in this study will generate epidemiological data to complement that derived from existing COPD cohorts and further explore determinants of COPD and the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, as well as to provide some understanding of the limitations of existing data. As exacerbation visits are triggered by patient diary data, accurate and timely diary completion is essential. All participants in this study receive diary training at enrolment and support is available from the study team at all times to promote accurate and complete diary keeping. Cohort retention is a key factor in the successful delivery of such a study and with in-depth sampling protocols, participant engagement, comfort and feedback are key factors in optimising cohort retention and comprehensive data collection.",

            "text": "Identification of novel approaches for the prevention of AECOPD is an important research goal. Long-acting \u03b2-agonists (LABA) and long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilators remain the cornerstone of treatment for patients with COPD.42 Combinations of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids are also used in patients with more severe disease and/or frequent exacerbations. Long-term treatment with macrolide antibiotics and pulsed quinolone therapy may be considered for exacerbation prevention.7\n43\n44 However, concerns exist about the potential for development of antimicrobial resistance during long-term antibiotic therapy. Numerous other approaches are under investigation for the prevention of AECOPD, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, antioxidants and non-pharmacological strategies. Vaccination is another potential approach meriting investigation for reducing AECOPD risk. However, optimal strategies targeting key respiratory pathogens are not yet available to the clinician.",
