The high number of new cases within a short period and the high-case death rate have caused public panic and attracted global attention. Some patient's families undertook large medical costs. According to the literature, exposure to live poultry could be an important risk factor for human infection with H7N9.1\u20135 As a result, closing down the live poultry markets and slaughtering the poultry were the main interventional measures in the affected areas of China. These interventions not only played an important role in disease prevention but also caused serious losses to the poultry industry.",

It is important to estimate the overall burden of disease (BOD) due to H7N9 in China because this virus is new to humans and could cause a global pandemic in the future. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study presents a comprehensive methodological framework for death and disability loss estimation and has had a pronounced impact on the BOD estimate.9\n10 In this study, we identified the main drivers of economic loss and summarised the direct and indirect costs of human H7N9 infection. We present an accurate and operable approach for estimating the overall burden of emerging infectious diseases and provide evidence on the cost-effectiveness of H7N9 prevention and control. We also set up a BOD estimate example for any animal-borne infectious disease, particularly with the introduction of modern medical devices.",

Based on the case category and characteristics of case spatiotemporal distribution, costs were broken down into direct medical costs (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (death, disability and PIL). To calculate the DALYs attributable to H7N9, the H7N9-specific years of life loss due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed and summed. An intensive analysis of PIL would be complex and would require time-consuming field surveys. Indirect effects may lag behind.

Four cost drivers were extracted: cost of outpatient and inpatient examinations in the ward, cost of examinations in intensive care units (ICUs), cost of treatment and other costs (including medical consumables, charge for sickbed, general care services, check-up fee, etc). A cost formula was constructed for each driver, as depicted in table 1. The cost per patient was estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and hospital doctors. The mean number of days (ICU stay, hospital stay and days of treatment) was estimated from the epidemiological data. The number of patients for each driver was derived from a previous publication.6 The professional's experience was also considered for some items that were not included in our surveillance system. Costs for the category \u2018unknown without death\u2019 were assumed to be moderate and were set as the average of the costs of mild cases and severe cases without death.",

To a large extent, the small number of patients in the H7N9 outbreak in China was due to quick and effective intervention, which prevented a pandemic.21 The estimate of direct medical costs and DALY costs, particularly the mean cost per patient and mean cost per day for different case categories, can be used to guide those counties in which no cases occurred during prevention and control of H7N9. DALY per H7N9 case (5176 DALYs/1000 cases) was much higher than most of other respiratory infectious diseases though DALYs per 100 000 population (2.23 DALYs based on affected county population) were lower than most of the infectious diseases according to the 2010 GBD study.22 A comparison to outbreaks of other infectious diseases (with similar clinical symptoms) was also considered in this report. The healthcare cost per patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing was \u00a517 150 (US$1886), whereas the average medical cost per patient with H7N9 was \u00a5125 363 (US$20 058) because of the higher death rate of patients with H7N9 and use of more expensive modern medical devices.23",

PIL were estimated at three levels: 27 prefectures with confirmed H7N9 cases, 10 affected provinces and 8 non-affected adjacent provinces. The outbreak of H7N9 may reduce the demand for poultry products in other regions of China due to public perception. These effects were not considered in this study. The cost of closing down the live poultry markets and the cost of poultry slaughter were calculated as direct PIL. We assumed that the cost per animal was \u00a510 (US$1.6) and the date for the end of closing the live poultry markets was 31 May 2013 because there has been few confirmed H7N9 cases since then. Losses from the live poultry industry accounted for 98% of the total losses, with the lost sales of live poultry constituting the majority of that amount. Strict prevention and control measures have been enacted in Guangdong Province, which had few reported H7N9 cases. This finding will be significant for similar cases in the future. Owing to timely control measures, the effects of the outbreak were limited to 27 prefectures in 10 provinces in China.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, there were 11 confirmed H7N9 cases without death whose case categories were unknown. The cost estimate for these unknown patients was replaced by the average cost of mild and severe cases without death. Second, in the cost model, some of the data (eg, the mean number of days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe without death cases) were obtained from a small proportion of investigated cases, which could result in an estimation bias. Third, the direct medical cost did not include opportunity cost,24 the cost that is incurred because a limited resource is used to treat a preventable disease and cannot therefore be used to treat another disease.25 The medical practitioner's salary, research funding and loss of working time for family numbers of patients with H7N9 were excluded from our study. Fourth, estimates of direct medical costs per day might show large differences for specific cases because the drug cost could grow considerably if imported and nutritional drugs were used. We considered only the average severity for patients in the ward and ICU. Fifth, 17 patients were still in the hospital on 28 May 2013 according to the literature.26 The mean numbers of days in the ward and ICU for severe cases and their death rate were thus underestimated. Some of the mild cases may not have been reported, which also resulted in underestimating the cost. Sixth, we considered only direct losses from closing down live poultry markets and large-scale poultry slaughter, which could be estimated accurately and quickly. This estimate was useful for early control and decision-making; however, other losses involved in the livestock-production chain, such as increased breeding costs, poultry seeding, the prices of poultry meat and eggs and the decreased production of poultry-feather industries should be considered in further studies.27",
