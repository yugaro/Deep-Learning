Passengers seated midcabin have more contacts if they leave their seats. Duration (minutes) of contact (Fig. S1) does not follow this pattern; rather, it tends to be slightly higher for passengers seated toward the front of the plane. The number of contacts increases linearly with observation period (which is very close to length of flight) for all movement\u2013seat combinations, except for passengers in window seats who never move (Fig. 2).",

This rate has been used in other transmission studies; see, for example, a simulation of influenza transmission in a high school in which contacts among students, faculty, and visitors were carefully quantified (17). In (Fig. 3) we present heat maps illustrating the probability that each passenger will have close contact with the infectious index passenger and the probability that an infectious index passenger will infect each of the other passengers. The 11 nearest neighbors have a high probability of becoming infected. However, the probability of transmission to each of the remaining passengers is quite low, less than 0.03. On average, this manifests as 0.7 additional infected passengers per flight (IQR: 0.4\u20131.5). The results of simulations for other seats indicate, on average, at most two additional infected passengers per flight.",

Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger. This is more conservative than current public health guidance, calling for surveillance of passengers within two rows of an infectious passenger.

Some transmissions may have occurred while waiting in the airport, while boarding, or while deplaning. Alternatively, some passengers may have been infected by other sources before or after the flight. Three of the five flights in these case reports range from 9.5 to 14 h, providing many more opportunities for transmission. Other transmissions may have occurred via fomites. Flyers can protect themselves from fomite transmission by exercising careful hand hygiene. Finally, our model assumes that droplets are the main transmission route for influenza and SARS. This assumption is based on general public health agency guidance to health care providers, but it may not be true: significant transmission may also occur via smaller virus-laden particles (the smallest being aerosols), which have larger dispersion distances.",

Our model is not applicable to other aerosol-transmitted diseases, such as tuberculosis (18), varicella, and measles (19).

According to Boeing engineers, airflow in an empty cabin lies on the \u201cboundary of turbulence,\u201d which is the hardest cabin airflow regime to simulate over long time periods. Previous transmission models have employed approximations to the 3D Navier\u2013Stokes equation (20\u201323) (perhaps valid for short time intervals) or assumed that the \u201cdroplets\u201d or aerosols are well-mixed in cabin air. In no case have previous investigators considered the effects of cabin occupancy or gasper use in Navier\u2013Stokes models. One group conducted numerical simulations to study the effect of vortices generated by the continuous movement of a crew member on the local dispersal of aerosols in a cabin (24). Assuming that the cabin airflow is at steady state, they found a decreased infection rate to the passengers but an increased infection rate to the crew member.",
