The gonorrhoea epidemic was especially prominent in Guangdong, which reported 18 014 new cases with a reported incidence of 17.15/100, 000.6 Over the past several decades, newly reported cases of gonorrhoea within Guangdong province consistently ranked within the top five provinces in China. Shenzhen, a part of the Guangdong province located in south coastal China and adjacent to Hong Kong, has witnessed an alarmingly rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in recent years.7 The reported gonorrhoea incidence in Shenzhen was 51.5/100 000 in 2011,8 which was the highest reported incidence in the entire province.",

Reported incidence is a very important measure for evaluating the urgency of an epidemic situation, and for establishing prevention and control efforts to combat the disease.

The \u201c2007 diagnostic criteria for gonorrhoea in China\u201d indicated,15 people who were tested positive for gonorrhoea with or without symptoms could be diagnosed with gonorrhoea. This document recommended Gram stain and isolate culture to test NG. Before sampling the urethral swab of a male patient, urination was not allowed at least 2 h. For male patient with symptoms, secrete can be collected using swabs. For an asymptomatic male patient, samples can be collected by placing swabs in urethra for 10\u201315 seconds. For a female patient, samples can be collected by placing swabs in cervix for 20\u201330s. Samples can also be obtained by massaging perineal and dip in secrete using swabs. Male patients without complications can be diagnosed conclusively with gonorrhoea with a positive Gram stain microscopy result; the diagnosis of male patients with complications and female patients should be based on the confirmation of NG-isolated culture. NG is a very fastidious organism and will perish if not kept in ideal circumstances. The laboratory conditions and the ability of workers would affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for gonorrhoea has enabled significant implementation since 2002, creating opportunities for more rapid and accurate gonorrhoea diagnosis.16 It has been demonstrated NAATs has a higher sensitivity and specificity than culture and microscopy for gonorrhoea test.17 However, this method has recently limited use in some of the big cities in China, due to its high cost and technical requirements. The Guideline for Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases of China,18 which was published in 2014, has regarded this method as one of the recommendatory methods to test NG, which has been adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

The problem occurred in the process of seeking healthcare in clinics, diagnosis, and case report to CISDCP. First, the physician should believe that the patient has a risk of infection and suggest to the patient to get an NG test done. Second, the patient should accept the physician's suggestion and get the NG test done. Third, the patient got a true positive result. Finally, the physician confirmed that the patient had NG infection, and reported this case to CISDCP. It is possible that the physician did not give the test suggestion, or that the patient was unwilling to get the NG test done, and the false-positive results may also be got by patients. The physician may also have forgotten to report the diagnosed gonorrhoea cases to CISDCP on time. In these instances, the information of these patients with gonorrhoea cannot be obtained from CISDCP. Moreover, some of the individuals may get a false-positive test result and be reported to CISDCP even though they do not have NG infection. The widespread use of CISDCP has underscored the importance of ensuring its accuracy. The discrepancies in symptoms and test methods between males and females may even lead to a different degree of accuracy of male and female reported gonorrhoea incidence.",

To the best of our knowledge, the impact of influence factors in the clinical diagnosis and the reporting process on the reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio has not as yet been quantified. It is helpful to find the weakness of disease surveillance system by identifying the influence factors of sex ratio. Thus, we designed and applied a patient survey questionnaire to collect information for gender and sociodemographic characteristics, and collected reporting data of gonorrhoea cases. Furthermore, we performed NG testing on all participants to ascertain gonorrhoea diagnosis. We used rates of untested patients, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate to quantify the accuracy of the reported gonorrhoea incidence during diagnosis and the reporting process. Finally, we calculated and compared the reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio with the true diagnosis sex ratio, and devised strategies to resolve these discrepancies.",

Participants were sampled conveniently and sequentially among those who presented to these clinics for care.

The sample collections were performed according to the Guidelines for Laboratory Diagnosis of Sexually Transmitted Diseases of China.19 This test result was regarded as the reference test to evaluate the accuracy of NG tests in clinics. After finishing the above procedures, the participant would continue their normal medical service. The clinic physicians then decided on whether or not to collect a second specimen and test for NG in clinics according to their typical diagnostic practices and experiences. Patients with a positive diagnosis of gonorrhoea (according to the second gonorrhoea test result) from the clinics were reported to CISDCP online within 6 or 12 h.
