Starting from probably November to December 2019, another Coronavirus entered the arena of human pathogens, to be then defined 2019- nCoV.1 The outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. China Republic arranged strong restrictions to limit domestic people circulation. Within days, most European countries and the United States established an unrestricted scientific cooperation to exchange data and information, useful to design a defensive wall against the worldwide spreading of this new epidemic. Spreading is favored by universal access to intercontinental mobility by airplane, and propensity of Chinese people to massively migrate within, but also outside, their subcontinent especially during national holidays.",
