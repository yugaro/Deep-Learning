            "text": "The cytosolic regions (without the transmembrane domain) of Sso2p, Sec22p and Ykt6p were expressed in E. Coli and purified to high quality (Fig. 1). To detect their interactions, we designed the microfluidic array as illustrated in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. According to the design, the interactions among three SNAREs were detected in 12 parallel areas (Fig. 2c). The application of target proteins will form a layer on a chip, and the interacting partners will form another layer on the chip (Fig. 2d). The light reflection intensity represented by grayscale value indicates the thickness of the SNARE protein film. Thus the increase of the grayscale value after the addition of potential interacting proteins could indicate the interaction strength. Fig. 3 shows the changes in grayscale values for bindings between Sso2p, Sec22p and Ykt6p. The corresponding P-values were calculated with single factor analysis of variance in Microsoft Office Excel24. As observed in Fig. 3, the protein A-IgG pair, the positive control on the microfluidic chip, demonstrated significant change in grayscale value in both directions (immobilizing protein A then adding IgG (P-value = 0.0002); immobilizing IgG then adding protein A (P-value = 0.0295)). Notably, for the Sso2p-Sec22p pair, we also observed significant change in grayscale value in both directions (immobilizing Sso2p then adding Sec22p (P-value = 0.0273); immobilizing Sec22p then adding Sso2p (P-value = 0.1227)). In addition, the Sso2p-Ykt6p pair could be regarded as positive interaction as there observed a significant change in grayscale when Ykt6p was added to the immobilized Sso2p (P-value = 0.0084). In static measurement, rinsing may cause remarkable false negatives especially for weak interactions. But false positives will not occur in high frequency. In this regard, the static ellipsometry measurement is reliable for weak interaction detection and it can be used as a rapid and convenient screening method before kinetic analysis.",

In SPR assay, Sec22p/Sso2p and Ykt6p/Sso2p (see Methods) also showed positive signal. After Sso2p was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip, Ykt6p was injected into the Sso2p channel at the concentration of 5 to 80 \u03bcM. Sec22p was injected into the Sso2p channel at the concentration of 1.25 to 40 \u03bcM. Supplemental Fig. S1 showed sensorgrams for the binding of Ykt6p (Fig. S1a) and Sec22p (Fig. S1b) to immobilized Sso2p. Sso2p was immobilized at 3938 RU. Ykt6p and Sec22p showed steady increase of the RUs during injection but the response levels in RU were extremely low at all concentrations of both analytes in relation to the theoretical analyte binding capacities. The weak signal may result from the large portion of inactivation of ligand in covalent immobilization step by amine coupling or the extremely low binding affinities of the interactions. In this study we would like to regard the SPR data as a qualitative evidence to estimate the binding specificities of the two SNAREs' interactions instead of evaluating their binding affinities.",

As seen from the sensorgrams for analysis of Ykt6p/Sso2p (Supplemental Fig. S2), reaction curves showed the dynamic changes in grayscale value during the whole analysis process including the stages of ligand immobilization and analyte injection. Fig. 4 highlighted the reaction curves of Sso2p/Ykt6p and Sso2p/Sec22p at various protein concentrations. Real-time binding curves were fitted (Supplemental Fig. S3). Coefficient of determination (R2) was used to measure goodness of fit in Fig. S3. The range of R2: 94% ~ 99% showed the consistence between the fitted curves and experimental curves, allowing us to obtain the association rate constant (ka), the dissociation rate constant (kd) and thus association constant (KA) (KA = ka/kd) and dissociation constant (KD) (KD = kd/ka) for the interactions. The kinetic constants of Sso2p/Ykt6p and Sso2p/Sec22p were summarized in Table 1. The ka, kd, KA and KD were 102 M\u22121S\u22121, 10\u22123 S\u22121, 104 M\u22121 and10\u22125 M, respectively.",

In microfluidic system, a multi-cell array is formed when a polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) pattern mold sits on the surface of a silicon substrate, each cell having an inlet and an outlet for solution passage28. These simple channel junctions can be used in serial or parallel formats to analyze many pairs of interactions simultaneously. As can be seen from our experimental design (Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b), the analysis of interactions between the three SNAREs together with positive and negative controls can be achieved in one chip. In addition, the image of multi-cell array can be obtained in several seconds using imaging ellipsometry. More importantly, real-time imaging ellipsometer offers a direct optical visualization of biomolecular layer, allowing qualitative and quantitative result analysis17. Presently, our real-time imaging ellipsometer can provide 24 reaction curves simultaneously. Such high-throughput detection can be completed in real time and rapidly. In addition, the experimental cost is relatively low, about $ 1 for one silicon wafer. With the enhanced throughput and the lower cost, imaging ellipsometer presents an attractive alternative to SPR biosensors.",

A microfluidic system is used for surface patterning, array fabrication, solution delivery, ligand immobilization and target injection15. A multi-cell array is formed when a PDMS pattern mould is in contact with the surface of a silicon substrate, each cell having an inlet and an outlet for solution passage28. The inlet micro-channels are put into the sample plate and the outlet micro-channels are connected with pumps (ISM939, ISMATEC, Switzerland. www.ismatec.com) offering negative pressure. For SNARE detection, Sec22p, Ykt6p and Sso2p as ligands (0.5 mg/ml, 5 \u03bcl) were delivered individually to each analytical area by the microfluidic system at the flow rate of 1 \u03bcl/min for 5 min and immobilized on the different lines above the dotted line in Fig. 2a. The binding buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) as blank was added to each area on the first row. Sec22p, Ykt6p and Sso2p as targets were injected onto the different rows above the dotted line in Fig. 2b, respectively. For control samples detection, IgG (0.1 mg/ml, 5 \u03bcl), BSA (0.1 mg/ml, 5 \u03bcl) and protein A (0.25 mg/ml, 5 \u03bcl) as ligands were immobilized on the different lines under the dotted line in Fig. 2a. PBST buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 1% tween 20, pH 7.3) as blank was added to each area on the first row under the dotted line (Fig. 2a). Control targets BSA, protein A and IgG were added to corresponding areas under the dotted line in Fig. 2b, respectively.",

These areas were rinsed with binding buffer between consecutive operation steps. After being taken from the microfluidic system, the wafer was rinsed with deionized water and then blown with nitrogen. The rinsing in deionized water and drying most likely cause changes in protein coverage due to shear stress desorption during rinsing. Because the procedure is indispensable for washing out nonspecific bindings, so the rinsing was kept as gentle and rapid as possible. The image of the multi-cell array was recorded by the imaging ellipsometer and the grayscale value of each area was analyzed by Automatic system of imaging ellipsometry, which consists a powerful software available for image acquisition, image processing and system control10. The principle of reading grayscale value can be seen in the relevant literature22.Rinsing should cause major changes to the coverage, so statistical analysis was necessary. For statistical analysis, grayscale value of ligand SNAREs were used as the negative control. The interaction between the ligand SNARE and target SNARE were detected four times. The significant change in grayscale value compared to the negative control (with P-value equal to or less than 0.05) is deemed as signal of positive interaction (marked with * in Fig. 3).",

            "text": "The carboxyl modification method15 was used to immobilize SNAREs. The ligand immobilization and binding assay detailed steps were shown above in Supplemental Fig. S2. Using Ykt6p/Sso2p as an example, Ykt6p (0.52 mg/ml, 50 \u03bcl/area) as ligand was delivered individually to each alytical area at the flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min for 10 min for immobilization. Casein Blocking Buffer 10\u00d7 was diluted 10 times and was delivered to each area (80 \u03bcl/area) at the flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min for 16 min. After blocking, the binding buffer was added until to flat curves. Target SNARE Sso2p was diluted with the binding buffer to different concentrations (1.05, 0.53, 0.26, 0.13 mg/ml). Target SNARE Sso2p (50 \u03bcl/area) was delivered to the corresponding area at the flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min for 10 min. The light reflection intensity was recorded once every 1 second. The volume of each microcell in microfluidic devices used in real-time ellipsometry is about 18 nl. Due to the micro scale of inner structure of microfluidic analytical chip, the fluid possesses high specific surface area as well as small diffusion distance which remarkably improves mass transfer rate31. The analytes were injected at the flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min can help to reduce the mass transport limitations. Another consideration for reducing the limiting of mass transport is that low ligands immobilization levels were used in real-time detection, for example: BSA as ligand is typically 0.25 \u03bcg/cm2 in the literature32. The closeness of fit to the Langmuir 1:1 model can also reflect the influence of mass transport limitation in our kinetic analysis is not prominent. In order to facilitate observation and fitting, the experimental curves including the association phase, the binding process reached equilibrium and dissociation phase were normalized (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4 (a) and (c), 25000 was used as the initial value on fitting curves, and then the following value were calculated by the formula: (data in the sigmoid curve) \u00d7 25000/(start data in the sigmoid curve). In Fig. 4 (b) and (d), 27000 was used as the initial value on fitting curves, and then the following value were calculated by the formula: (data in the sigmoid curve) \u00d7 27000/(start data in the sigmoid curve). After normalizing, real-time binding curves were fitted by ORIGIN 8.0 and were shown in Supplemental Fig. S3. Start fitting time was chosen behind the point adding target SNAREs in binding curves. End fitting time was chosen the point reaching equilibrium in binding curves. The kinetic analysis is performed with Langmuir 1:1 binding model. In NonLinear Curve Fitting, the equation in monomolecular growth model: y = A1 \u2212 A2e\u2212kx was used to fit real-time binding curves. The ka, kd and KA were calculated according to the literatures3334. Rate constants for the interaction (ka and kd) were derived from an analysis of the binding curves in real-time experiment33. KA was calculated from the ratio of ka/kd34. To interpret the sensorgram, first order kinetics was assumed and the association constant was given by: where C was the concentration of analytes;",
