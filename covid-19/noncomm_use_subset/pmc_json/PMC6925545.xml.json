Pre-emptive therapy can be used as a standalone strategy or combined with antiviral prophylaxis. Recently, letermovir, given as prophylaxis, was shown to reduce the risk of clinically significant CMV infection.18 We have shown that ganciclovir and foscarnet were the most frequently used drugs in our cohort for the therapy of CMV reactivation; accordingly to currently recommended first-line pre-emptive treatment.18 Nevertheless, management of patients with resistant or refractory CMV infection or CMV disease is a challenge. Combination therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet), cidofovir, leflunomide or artesunate can be considered in patients resistant or refractory to other second-line and third-line antiviral drugs, and immunosuppression should always be reduced, if possible.18",

In 80.3% (143/175) of EBV reactivations rituximab was used and 93.3% of patients survived this infection. We also observed that in almost 1/3 of EBV reactivations, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection treated with antivirals, which did not prevent the development of significant EBV-DNA-emia with the need of rituximab treatment. This is clinically proven evidence that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients. Antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir, are not active against EBV, presumably because of low levels of viral thymidine kinase expression during lytic phase, and a lack of expression during latency.8 Intravenous immunoglobulins also have no impact in PTLD. Neither ganciclovir/foscarnet nor cidofovir therapy/prophylaxis have any impact on the development of EBV-PTLD, so antiviral agents are not recommended.8 Prospective monitoring of EBV-DNA-emia is recommended in patients after allo-HCT, and these patients should be closely monitored for symptoms and/or signs attributable to EBV infection and PTLD.8 The following pre-emptive therapies are recommended after high-risk allo-HCT: rituximab (375 mg/m2/weekly), reduction of immunosuppressive therapy (if possible), donor EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells (EBV-CTL) infusion (if available).8 Compared with rituximab, adoptive cellular immunotherapy has higher response rate (50\u201388%) and fewer relapse.28",

The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HSCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% of cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of significant EBV-DNA-emia with the need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% of cases. This is clinically proven evidence that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients. Additionally, in 47.7% of these cases GVHD was a risk factor, possibly facilitating development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infections.",
