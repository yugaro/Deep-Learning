Therefore, we next examined gene expression of both MHC molecules and other components associated with antigen presentation; the majority of these genes were located within the MHC locus on human chromosome 6 (chr. 6), while others were interspersed throughout the genome (Table S2). The results indicated broad down-regulation of antigen-presentation molecules following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 2). In contrast, H1N1-09 infection had no effect or strongly increased expression of these genes; similarly, SARS-CoV also induced expression for the majority of these genes. Globally, both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection resulted in reduced expression of both MHC class I and II molecules. Similarly, the expression of other genes involved in antigen presentation, including transcription factors (CTIIA) and machinery (TAP2 and PDIA3), both in the MHC locus and on other chromosomes (distant), was also strongly down-regulated. Importantly, while adjacent genes on chr. 6 not involved in antigen presentation and MHC class III genes (complement, TNF, etc.) had some modulation, down-regulation was not uniform, suggesting specific targeting of MHC and antigen-presentation molecules by both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV.",

Consistent with transcriptomic data, peptides mapping to class I MHC proteins (HLA-A, -B, or -C) exhibited statistically significant decreases after MERS-CoV or H5N1-VN1203 infection, but were significantly increased in cells infected with SARS-CoV or H1N1-09 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, while MERS-CoV infection strongly down-regulated HLA-A, -B, and -C peptides, H5N1-VN1203 infection consistently down-regulated HLA-A and -C, but not HLA-B, peptides (Fig. 3). Peptides associated with other (non-HLA) antigen-presentation proteins exhibited similar overall expression patterns (Fig. 3A). Together, the transcriptomic and proteomic data indicate that antigen-presentation molecule expression is antagonized by MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infections\u2014with some potential differences in efficiency or mechanism of antagonism\u2014but not by SARS-CoV and H1N1-09 infections.",

To determine whether histone modifications also affect antigen-presentation gene expression, we examined enrichment of activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) methylation markers on the 5\u2032 promoters of MHC class I (HLA-A), II (HLA-DRB), and III (LTA) molecules in lysates from cells infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H5N1-VN1203, or H1N1-09 using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP-PCR)\u2013based approach. For the activating histone marker (H3K4me3), enrichment was observed only in HLA-A promoter regions following H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203 infection, and no enrichment or loss of H3K4 trimethylation was observed for HLA-DRB1 or LTA promoters following either influenza virus infection (Fig. 4A). SARS-CoV infections did not result in significant enrichment or loss of H3K4me3 for any of these genes. In contrast, MERS-CoV infection reduced H3K4 trimethylation for all three genes, with significant changes observed in HLA-DRB1 and LTA promoter regions. For all three promoter regions, strong reductions in the repressive marker (H3K27me3) were also observed following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (Fig. 4B); similarly, H1N1-09 and H5N1-VN1203 also reduced repressive marks for the HLA molecules. Together, the data suggest that modest transcriptional activation was possible if H3K4me3 motifs remained intact.",

In H5N1-VN1203 infections, we observed depletion of H3K4 trimethylation across the length of chr. 6, with the strongest depletion in parts of the MHC locus (Fig. 4C). Concurrently, few chr. 6 genes exhibited substantial depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (Fig. S1A), and some were enriched for H3K27me3 (Fig. S1B). Taken together, these observations suggest that H5N1-VN1203 infection may reduce the potential for transcriptional activation of chr. 6 genes, particularly within the MHC locus, and further implies that histone alterations may contribute to H5N1-VN1203\u2013mediated down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression. For MERS-CoV, histone modification data offer a muddled picture, with enrichment and depletion found for both activating and repressive markers (Fig. S1). Coupled with the ChIP-PCR of the promoter regions, these results suggest that histone modifications are not the driver of MERS-CoV\u2013mediated antagonism of antigen presentation.",

            "text": "While reduced histone modifications following MERS-CoV infection failed to explain down-regulation of antigen-presentation molecules, it suggested an alternative epigenetic mechanism: DNA methylation. Direct methylation of genomic DNA functionally ablates expression, indirectly leading to reduced access and loss of histone marks. To examine this possibility, we performed methylated DNA-IPs (MeDIPs) with virus-infected cells and then assessed the methylation status of three antigen-presentation-associated gene promoters (HLA-A, B2M, and PDIA3) using PCR (Fig. 5A). For H1N1-09, infection resulted in modest changes, with increased methylation of HLA-A and reduced methylation of B2M promoter regions. Similarly, SARS-CoV infection generally resulted in modest DNA methylation trending toward reduced methylation relative to mock-infected controls. In contrast, H5N1-VN1203 infection increased methylated DNA levels in the same target genes, and, strikingly, MERS-CoV infection resulted in complete methylation (100%) of all three target genes. To verify the effect observed in MERS-CoV infections, we performed MeDIP-PCR reactions for three additional antigen-presentation gene promoters (CIITA, HLA-E, and PSMB9) and again observed complete promoter methylation for all genes (Fig. S2). Global methylation analysis of chr. 6 revealed robust methylation across the entire chromosome following MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 5B). Importantly, while H5N1-VN1203 infection also induced increased methylation across chr. 6, its peaks were less in magnitude than observed in MERS-CoV infection.",

Both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 produced significant cytopathic effect by 24 h postinfection (hpi), contrasting both SARS-CoV and H1N1-09. However, while a global increase in methylation was observed following MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection, it was far from uniform across the entire genome. More in-depth analysis of methylation data found that, following MERS-CoV infection, the \u223c3.464-Mbp MHC locus maintained 49.11 meCpGs/Mbp. In contrast, the remainder of chr. 6 averaged 19.54 meCpGs/Mbp following MERS-CoV infection. Similarly, examination of other chromosomes (Table S3) found lower meCpG/Mbp rates, suggesting specificity in the magnitude of DNA methylation at the MHC locus and potentially other genomic locations. Similarly, H5N1-VN1203 methylation within the MHC locus corresponded to 34.29 meCpG/Mbp vs. 7.7 meCpG/Mbp over the remainder of the chr. 6. Together, these results suggest that DNA methylation is at least one of the primary mechanisms exploited by MERS-CoV to antagonize antigen-presentation gene expression in infected cells, while H5N1-VN1203 may use a combination of DNA methylation and histone-modification alterations to achieve a similar affect.",

Previous work by our group implicated influenza NS1 in histone modification and ISG down-regulation compared with a similarly replication attenuated PB2 mutant (6). In this study, we extended this analysis to antagonism of antigen-presentation molecules. Following infection of Calu3 cells with wild-type (WT), C-terminal truncation of NS1 (NS1trunc124), or PB2 encoding an amino acid substitution (PB2-K627E) mutant viruses, we examined changes in viral replication as well as HLA-A and -C peptide abundance (Fig. 6 A and B). While the overall peptide level was decreased relative to mock, truncation of H5N1-VN1203 NS1 resulted in augmented protein expression of both MHC class I molecules relative to the WT virus. Importantly, the reduction of MHC class I down-regulation was not a product of attenuated viral replication, as the PB2 mutant had similar replication kinetics and titer, but maintained HLA-A and -C antagonism (Fig. S3A). Together, the results implicate a role for NS1 in modulation of antigen presentation following H5N1-VN1203 infection.",

The absence of MHC locus antagonism in SARS-CoV and other CoV infection suggested that a nonconserved portion of the MERS-CoV backbone is involved. With this in mind, we focused on the MERS-CoV accessory ORF proteins, which have limited sequence similarities with other CoV family proteins. Using a previously described MERS-CoV mutant that deletes all four accessory ORFs (d3-5) (15), we infected Calu3 cells and examined both viral replication and proteomics. Following infection, the d3-5 mutant virus produced robust attenuation in terms of viral replication (Fig. S3B). However, despite a nearly 100-fold reduction in viral replication, the d3-5 mutant viruses maintained strong down-regulation of MHC class I molecules HLA-A and -C (Fig. 6 C and D). While not equivalent to WT MERS-CoV down-regulation, the d3-5 mutant maintained lower absolute MHC class I peptide abundance compared with WT H5N1-VN1203 (Fig. 6 A and B). Together, the data suggest that even a robustly attenuated MERS-CoV mutant can stimulate down-regulation of antigen-presentation molecules and potentially implicate host processes in contributing to reduction of MHC class I molecules following infection.",

Expanding on the initial comparison, analysis of functional categories demonstrated global down-regulation of MHC and antigen-presentation molecules following both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection; these results correspond to MHC down-regulation reported for H5N1 in A549 and chicken embryonic fibroblasts (16, 17). The changes in RNA expression were found throughout the MHC locus and were confirmed by proteomic analysis in both viruses. Seeking mechanistic insights, epigenetic studies captured robust increases in DNA methylation following MERS-CoV infection with no similar trend observed following mock or SARS-CoV infection. However, while H5N1-VN1203 had augmented DNA methylation relative to mock, its overall increase was less uniform than MERS-CoV, leaving the possibility that histone modification may also contribute to control of antigen-presentation gene expression. Together, the data from both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection suggest that multiple epigenetic mechanisms contribute to antagonism of the host immune response.",

These results suggest that MERS-CoV entry or initial steps of infection trigger antagonism of antigen presentation. One possibility is stimulation of host processes that directly or indirectly result in reduction of the antigen-presentation molecules. For example, MERS-CoV infection may stimulate depression of host gene regulation, resulting in increased competition for transcription factors driving MHC expression. Alternatively, activation of DNA methylation pathways may be initiated by MERS-CoV infection, resulting in regulation of host constitutive processes as well as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor expression (18).

Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which is limited to pneumocytes and ciliated airway epithelium in the lung (19), MERS-CoV has broader tropism, infecting not only nonciliated airway epithelial cells and type 1/2 pneumocytes in the lung, but a number of immune cell populations, including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in vitro (20\u201322); similarly, a number of H5N1-VN1203 strains have been reported to infect both macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro (23, 24). In the context of antigen presentation, the expanded tropism of both viruses potentially impacts systemic aspects of adaptive immunity and memory responses. For H5N1 strains, modulation of antigen presentation may contribute to the inefficacy of the CD8 T-cell response during acute infection (25) and marginal, waning memory responses overall (26). Similarly, MERS-CoV infection has been characterized by uneven and often marginal antibody serum neutralization in recovering patients (27, 28). For both viruses, manipulation of antigen presentation may contribute to these diminished responses and may have important ramifications for both vaccine designs.",

While always a consideration for DNA viruses that reside in the nucleus, recent research has focused on how viruses utilize aspects of the epigenetic machinery to enable persistence and emergence (30). In addition, several reports have highlighted how viruses have disrupted epigenetic regulation and impact the host immune response. For example, NS1 of influenza H3N2 has been implicated as a histone mimic disrupting the antiviral response (8). Similarly, both hepatitis C virus and adenoviruses have proteins that interfere with epigenetics functions and alter global immune function (7, 31, 32). Previous work by our group found clear association of repressive histone modification H3K27me3 with down-regulated ISGs following both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection (6); subsequently, despite pathway and transcription factor activation, the repressed state physically prevented transcription of these genes. Similarly, our results in this work argue that DNA methylation plays a similar role in the loss of antigen-presentation molecules following both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 infection. Importantly, the sequencing data suggest that other specific regions of the genome are also targeted by global methylation, potentially signifying critical pathways modulated by viral antagonism and providing a path for future studies. In addition, viruses may utilize distinct epigenetic mechanism in parallel, resulting in specific targeting of host ISGs by H3K27 trimethylation instead of DNA methylation within that genome region. Together, these results suggest that multiple viruses target different epigenetic processes to modulate aspects of host immunity and indicate that additional studies will be required to fully understand how epigenetics modulates the host immune response following virus infection.",

Convergent evolution predicts that diverse viruses will utilize similar and divergent strategies to overcome common host immune responses to produce successful infections (33). Therefore, in leveraging available systems-based datasets, we seek similarities and contrast between viruses while taking advantage of uniform platforms, infection conditions, and data collection methods (34). The results have provided insights into both MERS-CoV and H5N1-VN1203 manipulation of IFN responses and antigen presentation. These findings provide not only a better understanding of the host response to infection, but also have the potential to aid in the development of treatment and prevention strategies. Future studies should expand these approaches to explore other specific aspects of immunity, including inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and autophagy. Similarly, viral cross-comparisons can also be integrated across data types as well as in vitro and in vivo systems as an additional metric for more traditional modeling approaches (35\u201338). Importantly, much of this analysis can occur on publicly available datasets, increasing both the utility and impact of already existing systems data (34, 39). Overall, surveying contrasts in host responses between viruses represents a powerful means to understand treatment and pathogenesis.",
