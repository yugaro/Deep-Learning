Approximately 132,000 cases of melanoma and 2\u20133 million cases of NMSC are reported per annum globally (1,2). Extensive exposure to sunlight has been closely associated with skin cancer (3), and the formation of skin cancer has been reported to be associated with one or numerous signaling pathways (4). Various coordinated biological alterations, including but not limited to epidermal hyperplasia, inflammation, oxidative stress and proliferation, are essential events associated with skin tumor progression (4,5).",

It has previously been suggested that juglanin inhibits apoptosis and the inflammatory response through Toll-like receptor 4-modulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathways, respectively, in rats with hepatitis (9). In addition, juglanin has been revealed to decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species in senescent cells induced by adriamycin treatment (10). Furthermore, juglanin may exert inhibitory effects against lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in RAW 264.7 macrophages, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6 (11). However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of juglanin in autophagy and apoptosis in UVB-induced skin injury remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, it remains to be determined as to whether juglanin suppresses the growth of human skin cancer.",

Various signaling pathways have been reported to have a crucial role in the response of cells to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. In addition, the MAPK family subgroups, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, have been reported to serve an important role in cell apoptosis and proliferation (13,14). UVB induces potentially lethal injuries to cellular DNA, thus initiating cellular recovery mechanisms, including activation of DNA damage response pathways and apoptosis (15). However, some DNA-injured cells could induce apoptosis, destruct differentiation control and even lead to the formation of cancerous cells in the end (16). Therefore, exploring novel therapeutic strategies for apoptotic induction, and the suppression of cell proliferation and inflammation in skin cancer is necessary.",

The radiant dose was quantified, at the appropriate distance, using a UVB Daavlin Flex Control Integrating Dosimeter (Daavlin, Bryan, OH, USA) and was further confirmed using an external radiometer (X-96 Irradiance Meter; Daavlin) before and after each irradiation session. An electrical fan was used to avoid excessive heating. As for the acute radiation experiments, mice were exposed to UV radiation at a dose of 600 mJ/cm2 in groups and were euthanized 24 or 72 h after irradiation. For skin carcinogenesis experiments, the animals were exposed twice a week for 10 weeks on Mondays and Wednesdays to solar-simulated UV radiation in clear bedding-free cages. During the process, the animals were consecutively administered various doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of juglanin by gavage. Finally, the dorsal skin was harvested, and computer-assisted image analysis, using a Zeiss KS300 (version 3.0; M\u00fcnchen, Germany,) was used to observe vessel size.

Having established the effects of juglanin on UVB-induced skin injury, the present study explored the effects of 600 mJ/cm2 solar-simulated UV radiation on normal mice; juglanin exerted dose-dependent alterations in the appearance of skin vasculature 24 h after exposure (Fig. 1B). UVB exposure led to upregulated epidermal thickness in the Mod group, as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells compared with in the control mice (Fig. 1C). Following UVB exposure, administration of juglanin (10 and 20 mg/kg to mice) led to the suppression of epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration compared with in the Mod group (Fig. 1C). KI67 expression was assessed in the skin of UVB-induced mice administered juglanin. In mice in the Mod group, the expression levels of KI67 were markedly higher compared with in the control mice. However, juglanin treatment significantly downregulated KI67 expression in the skin of UVB-exposed mice compared with in the Mod group (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggested that juglanin exerts potential effects on the amelioration of UVB-stimulated skin carcinogenesis in animals.",

IL-1\u03b2 is associated with the hemostatic function of normal skin in animals, but is also involved in various pathophysiological situations, including inflammation, when generated excessively. IL-1\u03b2 can be secreted from infiltrated macrophages, mast cells and keratinocytes following exposure to UV (24). TNF-\u03b1 enhances the local inflammatory response in the epidermis and possesses an essential role in photodamage (25). Furthermore, IL-6 has an essential role in the acute phase response during acute inflammation, and production of IL-6 is increased in the skin following UV exposure (26). The expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected in the skin from UVB-exposed mice treated with juglanin. In UVB-exposed mice, the protein expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were significantly upregulated compared with in the control group. Conversely, treatment with juglanin significantly reduced the protein expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the skin of UVB-exposed mice compared with in the Mod group (Fig. 3A). NF-\u03baB is an essential regulator that contributes to the release of proinflammatory cytokines (27). The present study demonstrated that NF-\u03baB was activated in mice exposed to UV, which was downregulated by juglanin administration (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, RT-qPCR was used to confirm that UV-induced activation of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was downregulated by juglanin administration (Fig. 3B). In addition, TNF-\u03b1 was stimulated in the Mod group, whereas juglanin treatment could reverse this UV-induced overexpression, as determined by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3C). Finally, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that NF-\u03baB was activated in the Mod group, whereas juglanin administration was able to reduce p-NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicated that juglanin may ameliorate skin carcinogenesis via the suppression of inflammation.",

Conversely, juglanin treatment decreased the expression levels of these proteins. UVB-induced skin damage is associated with the ability of cells to assess or reverse DNA damage, regulating the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis if necessary. In UVB-exposed skin, DNA damage leads to p53 expression, as well as its downstream target proteins p27 and p21 (28). As presented in Fig. 4B, UVB exposure downregulated p53, p27 and p21 protein expression compared with in the control group. In addition, juglanin administration to UVB-induced mice promoted p53, p27 and p21 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that PCNA was upregulated in UV-induced mice, whereas juglanin administration was able to reduce PCNA expression; this finding was in accordance with the results of western blotting (Fig. 4C).",

In addition, B16F10 cells were administered juglanin (2.5\u201330 \u03bcM) and cell viability was investigated. Juglanin (2.5\u201310 \u03bcM) did not induce B16F10 cell death, whereas 20 and 30 \u03bcM juglanin significantly reduced cell viability (Fig. 6A). To determine the specificity of the proapoptotic effects of juglanin, Hs68 fibroblast cells were treated with juglanin and cell viability was analyzed. Notably, juglanin induced no significant cell death in Hs68 cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, the present study indicated that UVB exposure led to a significant downregulation in the viability of B16F10 cells (Fig. 6C). Upon UVB irradiation at 10 mJ/cm2, the viability of B16F10 cells was decreased by ~40% compared with in unirradiated control cells. However, 10 mJ/cm2 UVB induced no apparent cell death of normal Hs68 human fibroblast cells, and was therefore selected for further experiments (Fig. 6D). The present study investigated whether juglanin enhanced cell death of UVB-irradiated B16F10 cells. The results indicated that treatment of UVB-irradiated B16F10 cells with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM juglanin increased the percentage of cell death (Fig. 6E). These results indicated that the effectiveness of juglanin to induce cell death was, at least partly, contributed to specific cell type and may rely on the concentration of administration.",

The results indicated that p53, p27 and p21 were lowly expressed in the control group, and were stimulated by UV exposure when combined with juglanin, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B).

            "text": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, particularly in USA, which accounts for ~50% of all human cancers (30). Solar UVB radiation is an ubiquitous environmental carcinogen, which leads to various cutaneous disorders, including melanoma and NMSCs (31). Previous studies have indicated that plant-derived compounds possess potential anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, and are gaining considerable attention regarding the prevention and inhibition of UVB-induced skin damage (32). Juglanin is a natural compound extracted from crude Polygonum aviculare, which exhibits inhibitory activity against inflammation and cancer growth (7). In the present study, juglanin was topically applied to UVB-exposed SKH-1 hairless mice by gavage in order to explore its effects on inflammatory markers, and the p38/JNK and PI3K/AKT-associated apoptosis signaling pathways (33). In response to UVB irradiation, activation of p38 MAPK and JNK is considered to induce apoptosis (34). Therefore, the inactivation of p38 and JNK is likely to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of juglanin in UVB-irradiated mice and cells. In our study, we found that in vivo p38 MAPK and JNK MAPK pathway was inactivated by juglanin in UVB-treated animals, while apoptosis was induced by juglanin. Herein, we supposed that there might be other signals involved in juglanin-regulated apoptosis in the skin of mice with UVB irradiation. Furthermore, in vivo, UV reduced caspase activation and PARP cleavage, whereas in vitro, it increased them. As for this, we hypothesized that there were different types of cells in tissue composition, while in vitro, only skin cancer cells were included (35). Consequently, different results were observed. Thus, further study is still required in future to comprehensively reveal the underlying molecular mechanism by which juglanin modulates apoptotic response in multiple types of cells.",

The inflammatory response promotes skin cancer progression. In addition, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 serve a critical role in induction of UVB-induced skin hyperplasia and inflammation (37). In the present study, the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were increased following UVB exposure, whereas juglanin treatment significantly inhibited TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression in the skin of UVB-exposed mice. Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines further promotes infiltration of inflammatory cells (38). In addition, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is associated with the transcription of numerous proinflammatory genes, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and TNF-\u03b1 (39). It has previously been suggested that UVB radiation enhances NF-\u03baB signaling in mouse skin (40). PI3K/AKT has been suggested to have an important role in modulating the inflammatory response via regulation of NF-\u03baB (41). A previous study reported that the PI3K/AKT-regulated NF-\u03baB pathway was involved in myocardial injury following chronic stress (42). In addition, UVB radiation has been reported to stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway in vivo and in vitro (43). Given the possible causal relationship of inflammation with cancer, the present study hypothesized that the PI3K/AKT-regulated NF-\u03baB pathway may be involved in UVB-induced skin cancer. The in vivo results of the present study indicated that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was activated, accompanied with increased PI3K/AKT phosphorylation, in UVB-exposed mice. Notably, juglanin was able to suppress inflammation via NF-\u03baB inactivation and AKT inhibition.",

Once activated, the p53 protein translocates to the nucleus and activates numerous DNA-binding proteins and downstream effectors associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction (44). In UVB-exposed skin, p53 activation leads to p27 and p21 activation, which in turn suppresses cyclin D/CDK1 kinases in skin cancer. Blockage of the cell cycle helps to repair damaged DNA via nucleotide excision repair mechanisms (45). In the present study, western blotting clearly demonstrated that p53, p27 and p21 expression was decreased in the skin of UVB-exposed mice and cells. Juglanin treatment further augmented protein expression of p53, p27 and p21 in UVB-exposed mice and cells in vivo and in vitro. PCNA enhances degradation of the replication initiation factor complex induced by DNA damage; upregulated PCNA expression in UVB-induced DNA-injured cells is a result of the combination of p53 and the PCNA promoter (46). In the present study, treatment with juglanin significantly suppressed the protein expression levels of PCNA in the skin of UVB-exposed mice. In addition, cyclin D1 is an important proliferative marker, which regulates cell proliferation (47). Overexpression of cyclin D1 is associated with the development and progression of numerous types of cancer, including UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis (48). In the present study, UVB exposure significantly upregulated cyclin D1 expression. However, juglanin treatment significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 in the skin of UVB-exposed mice.",

In addition, juglanin suppressed the p38/JNK and PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, which are involved in UVB-induced inflammation, cell survival, apoptosis and proliferation. Juglanin treatment also enhanced UVB-mediated p53, p27 and p21 protein expression. Notably, juglanin treatment is not toxic to mouse skin. Overall, these results indicated that juglanin may be developed as a natural and novel chemopreventive agent for the therapeutic treatment of UVB-induced skin cancer.",
