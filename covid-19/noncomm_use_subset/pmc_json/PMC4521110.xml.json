It performed an analysis of 12 strains of ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus (corona virus 229E/OC43/NL63, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, influenza A/B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, rhinovirus A/B/C, and metapneumo virus) and 2 strains of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus (adenovirus and bocavirus). It sequentially performed reverse transcription (RT) and multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR)s within one PCR tube, and it detected the DNA regions of the bocavirus and the adenovirus. The RNA regions of specific genes of the 12 strains of RNA virus synthesized complementary DNA (cDNA) through RT, then cDNA created each real-time target PCR product along with specific primers.
