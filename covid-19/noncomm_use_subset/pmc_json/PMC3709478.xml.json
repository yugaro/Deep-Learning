Note that although all of our results here are derived from inactivated virus, our analyses of EV71 demonstrate that such stochastic cross-links do not perturb the capsid\u2019s three-dimensional structure14. One batch of inactivated virus contained 160S mature virions plus natural empty particles, whereas another contained natural empty particles plus other particles that ran at markedly less than 160S. These latter particles were analysed by zonal ultracentrifugation, analytical ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Figs S1\u2013S3). Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that they have a sedimentation coefficient of 120S, somewhat less than the 135S value normally associated with A-particles, but their 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.66 confirms that they contain RNA and gel electrophoresis analysis shows no evidence of VP4, typically 135S particles have lost VP4 (Supplementary Fig. S3). These particles are therefore equivalent to the 135S disassembly intermediates identified for poliovirus; hence, we term them \u2018135S-like\u2019. It remains unclear why conversion occurred in only one batch of material (Supplementary Fig. S1). The PaSTRy assay25 was used to investigate the stability and RNA accessibility of the 135S-like and natural empty particles (Supplementary Fig. S4), demonstrating that the 135S-like particles are less stable than the natural empty particles, and that the viral RNA, which is inaccessible to fluorescent dye in the 160S mature virion, becomes accessible on conversion to the 135S-like particle.",

The two forms are essentially indistinguishable (r.m.s.d. 0.34 \u00c5 for 697 C\u03b1s); however, the P4232 data yielded more reliable coordinates, which are used for all subsequent analyses. The CAV16 135S-like particle is exactly icosahedral, strikingly similar in structure to that of the EV71 80S-like particle14, and broadly similar to the expanded form of HRV2 (13) and the intermediate structures of enteroviruses determined by cryo-EM6789. Compared with mature virions, the particles show a 4% increase in capsid radius, a collapsed VP1 pocket, and paired helices from two molecules of VP2 are pulled apart, opening a major channel at the icosahedral two-fold axis \u2018two-fold axis channel\u2019, together with a smaller channel nearby at the base of the canyon \u2018off-axis channel\u2019. Comparing the CAV16 135S-like particle with the 80S-like EV71 particle (PDB code 3VBR), the r.m.s.d. in C\u03b1 positions for 671 matched residues is 0.9 \u00c5, which falls to 0.7 \u00c5 if the icosahedral asymmetric units are superposed as rigid bodies (Supplementary Fig. S5). This great similarity in atomic structure supports the proposal14 that there are essentially two distinct configurations for enterovirus capsids, one corresponding to the mature virion and the other expanded, with different antigenic properties (Fig. 1). As expected, the expanded CAV16 particle lacks visible VP4. Indeed in line with other expanded particles, the internal protein festoon, primarily composed of VP4 and the N terminus of VP1, is completely lost.",

            "text": "There are two notable differences between the CAV16 135S-like and EV71 80S-like structures: a widening of the two-fold axis channel and an obstruction in the smaller off-axis channel (Fig.1 b). Remarkably, the off-axis channel is plugged by the VP1 N terminus. Although the first 61 residues of VP1 are disordered (or cleaved), we can visualize 11 residues beyond those visible in the EV71 80S-like particle, 7 of which traverse the capsid (entering at residue 71 and leaving at residue 65) terminating on the surface at residue 62 (Figs 1c and 2a). Although this change has relatively little overall impact on the particle (Figs 1b,c and 2b; for example, the structure of the pocket-factor-binding region is almost identical (Fig. 2c)), there are marked alterations in the VP3 GH loop region. This loop contains a helix in the mature virion, but in both expanded particles it forms a \u03b2-hairpin. In the 80S-like particle the hairpin is short and clipped onto an extension of the I-strand of the VP3 \u03b2-barrel, whereas in the 135S-like particle the hairpin is more extended with one edge clipped to the VP3 \u03b2-barrel and the other to the extruded VP1 N terminus to form a sheet of five strands (Fig. 2d\u2013f). The enlargement of the two-fold axis channel in the 135S-like particle is achieved mainly by the reorientation of side chains, triggered by a reorganization of the carboxy terminus of VP2. In the 80S-like particle Arg 249 of VP2 interacts with carbonyl groups at the base of the VP3 GH loop, whereas in the 135S-like particle this side chain is disordered and the VP2 C terminus is rearranged, as is the side chain of Phe 98 of VP2. The net effect of these subtle changes is to increase the cross-section area of the two-fold axis channel by some 40%. The residues that separate the two-fold axis and off-axis channels are much less well ordered in the expanded particles than in the mature virus (Fig. 3a). Geometric considerations show that the expansion and loss of protein components results in an increase in internal particle volume of ~25% for the 135S-like particle compared with the mature virus. We have calculated low-resolution maps for the CAV16 135S-like particle to investigate the RNA structure and these show an ~15 \u00c5 gap between the capsid and density, which we interpret as condensed viral genome (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the mature EV71 virion the RNA is evenly packed at a concentration of >800 mg ml\u22121, forming a semistable core, which can be isolated from the virus2627 (in the so-called plant picornaviruses, the far lower RNA concentration allowed ordered RNA to be detected)28.",

            "text": "The crystallographic results from EV71 and CAV16 can be combined with the wealth of other data available for enteroviruses7102930, to detail much of the process of cell attachment and entry. Work on poliovirus has shown that the mature virion \u2018breathes\u2019 transiently exposing the N terminus of VP1 (residues 1\u201353; Fig. 5a)4. This has been captured by EM, again for poliovirus, using a Fab directed against the N terminus of VP1, showing egress close to the two-fold axes30. Usually the N terminus retracts rapidly back into the particle4; however, on binding the cellular receptor (or in some viruses, such as the minor receptor group rhinoviruses, following a drop in pH), the lipidic pocket factor leaves VP1, probably in a cooperative fashion and the balance tips in favour of the expanded state, as described for EV71 (ref. 14). The mechanism appears to be that receptor interaction at the sensor\u2013adaptor region transmits changes, which destabilize the helix interactions at the icosahedral two-folds14. The expansion of the capsid increases its volume by 12% (arising from a 4% increase in radius14), facilitating movement of the VP1 N terminus (~85 \u00c5 for EV71) to exit the capsid at the two-fold channel29 (Fig. 5b) with little perturbation to the structure. The CAV16 135S-like structure we report here shows that up to 64 residues of VP1 are exposed, including residues 3\u201322, which are likely to form an amphipathic helix15. If the particle remains in the expanded form, the CAV16 135S-like structure shows that the VP1 N terminus must then move sideways towards off-axis channel at the base of the canyon, rearranging the VP3 GH loop en route before being finally pinned to it by the main-chain hydrogen bonds. This also has the effect of increasing the size of the two-fold axis channel as described above. This structure is seen not only in our analysis of CAV16 135S-like particles, but also suggested by low-resolution cryo-EM analyses of 135S poliovirus particles9 (Fig. 5c). If the exposed VP1 amphipathic helix engages a host membrane, it will likely tug the VP1 N terminus, accelerating the motion through a \u2018Brownian ratchet\u2019 mechanism. A second VP1 N terminus can now exit through the two-fold axis channel and slide into the small opening on the opposite side of the two-fold (Fig. 5d). Unravelling the VP1 N termini from the virus interior presumably unlocks the adjacent coils of VP4, which can, in turn, exit through the enlarged two-fold axis channel (Fig. 5f). This membrane-association-catalysed process, combined with the icosahedral symmetry of the capsid, results in a series of 30 potential exit portals for the RNA, few of which will be close to the cell membrane.",

            "text": "Previous analyses have established that the extruded VP1 N terminus contains an amphipathic helix at its end, which can associate with membrane. We see that this is attached by a 40-residue tether (likely to be extended, as is seen in the mature EV71 virus where this structure is inside the capsid), whereas the 69-residue VP4 molecules attach to the membrane via their N-terminal myristates1731. Electron tomographic data suggest that before RNA release through the vesicle membrane, these two types of polypeptide combine to form an ~50-\u00c5-long tube between the membrane and the virus32, which forms a conduit for the RNA genome to the cytoplasm of the cell. Higher-resolution tomographic results are required to reveal the architecture of this engagement. The question remains why the RNA does not exit prematurely following receptor binding. Although we do not know the signal that triggers RNA release, in the CAV16 electron-density maps we observe links (Fig. 4) between the capsid and RNA density, one of which occurs at the point where VP1 leaves the capsid. These features suggest a mechanism of communication from outside the capsid to the RNA. Remarkably, RNA is resistant to hydrolysis by high levels of RNase during transfer in vivo, consistent with polarized exit through the appropriate channel, and it has also been shown to be resistant to RNAse in vitro (J. Hogle, personal communication). The gap we see between the genome and the expanded capsid in the CAV16 135S-like structure suggests that the RNA core might rotate within the capsid, and it is conceivable that tension in the membrane-attached VP1 N terminus might induce further opening of the appropriate two-fold axis channel. However, the mechanism by which the correct channel is selected for RNA egress is not established, and indeed virus rolling to achieve alignment cannot be ruled out. It seems most plausible that one end of the RNA exits first, most likely the 3\u2032-end, as this has less secondary structure and, as the final portion to be synthesized, it is likely to be on the outside of the condensed genome, close to the capsid. The negatively charged regions on the inside of the particle close to the two-fold may then help direct the RNA through the appropriately sized two-fold axis channel (Supplementary Fig. S6) by electrostatic focusing (Fig. 3c). The RNA secondary structure is lost during the egress, as shown by loss of fluorescence of intercalating dye23, and, despite the flexibility of the particle in the region of the two-fold axis channel (Fig. 3b), this is likely to slow the exit process in regions of high secondary structure.",

On I24, the X-ray beam was homogenized with a 0.25-mm carbon plate and focused downstream from the crystal. Using 0.1 s exposure times and 100% beam transmission, typically 4\u201315 useful images could be collected from a crystal (Table 1).",

Structures in both space groups were determined by molecular replacement35 using the coordinates of the empty EV71 particle (PDB code 3VBR) as the search model. Rigid-body refinement followed by cyclic positional, simulated annealing and B-factor refinement used strict NCS constraints with CNS36. Averaging used GAP (DIS, J Grimes and J Diprose, unpublished observations) and models were rebuilt with COOT37. Models were verified with PROCHECK38. X-ray data and structure refinement statistics are shown in Table 1 and a stereo picture of electron density for the P4232 structure is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7. Structural comparisons used SHP39. Structural figures were prepared with The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.",
