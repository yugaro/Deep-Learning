We classified as secondary any case that had (1) worked, visited, or been admitted to a healthcare setting, or (2) had contact with a known MERS-CoV case or an individual with severe respiratory illness in the 14 days before illness onset (exposure period). Sporadic cases were defined as those not meeting criteria for classification as a secondary case. Cases were labeled unknown if available information was insufficient to determine a classification.",

All 6 cases were either from Riyadh or had traveled to Riyadh within the exposure period. Four of the 6 cases were exposed to Hospital A as patients or visitors. Phylogenetic and recombinational analysis revealed that all 6 viruses were members of a recently described novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015). Sequences from cases linked to Hospital A were genetically similar (Figure 1B) and distinct from 2 cases not linked to Hospital A. Of cases not linked to Hospital A, one had visited a relative (not a MERS case) in a Riyadh hospital where limited transmission had occurred, but the patient denied contact with a known MERS-CoV case. The other case was an 83-year-old man who resided in Jeddah, but he had visited Riyadh during the exposure period and had healthcare contact in both Riyadh (not Hospital A) and Jeddah for a chronic illness. The MERS-CoV sequence from this patient possessed a unique 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion spanning positions 387/388 to 407/408 of the nonstructural protein gene ORF5. Whereas native ORF5 is predicted to encode a 224-amino acid (aa) protein, the deletion would predict a 147-aa truncated protein consisting of the amino-terminal 129 aa of ORF5 plus 18 non-ORF5 residues prematurely terminating in an out-of-frame stop codon. This sequence clustered most closely with MERS-CoV sequences derived from 3 camels in April 2015 from Taif, SA, that lacked the deletion [4] (Figure 1B). No definitive link to camels was identified for this patient; however, the patient was deceased and the interview was conducted with a relative.",

Overall, 129 (90%) of 143 cases reported in July and August were exposed to a healthcare setting or had close contact with a known MERS-CoV case during the exposure period. Sporadic cases were relatively uncommon. The case fatality rate of 43% during July\u2013August 2015 was similar to the overall MERS-CoV case fatality rate of 42% reported in SA since 2012 [8]. Other characteristics of cases, such as male predominance, median age, and a high prevalence of medical comorbidities, particularly diabetes, are consistent with what has been described from earlier outbreaks [2, 9]. Our findings demonstrate that transmission of MERS-CoV continues to be predominantly linked to healthcare exposure and, to a lesser extent, household exposure to close contacts [2, 3].",

Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV possesses 5 group-specific ORFs (3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b) that encode putative accessory proteins whose functions have not yet been fully characterized [12]. Deletion analysis by reverse genetics has shown that several of these ORFs, including ORF5, are not essential for virus replication in vitro [13]. The ORF5 frameshift mutation described here would most likely result in diminished or lost protein function, suggesting that it was not essential for efficient virus propagation in this particular patient. The possible effect of the ORF5 frameshift mutation on the clinical course of infection in this patient is unknown; we have no evidence that the deletion resulted in altered virulence or transmissibility of the virus, nor do we know whether the MERS-CoV ORF5 deletion was successfully transmitted to a new host.",

Additional cases linked to Hospital A outside of our defined study period were not included in the analysis; therefore, this is not a complete description of the Hospital A outbreak. We considered any contact with a healthcare setting during the exposure period a criterion for classification as a secondary case, regardless of whether MERS-CoV cases had been reported from the facility. In cases where proxies were used for telephone interviews, knowledge of the case-patient's activities during the exposure period may have been incomplete. Although we were able to obtain sequences from a small number of available specimens, additional sequences could have allowed a better understanding of links between cases.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed from MERS-CoV genome sequences obtained from the 6 cases reported during July\u2013August, 2015, and all near complete genome sequences available in public domain (n = 188) using the program MrBayes version 3.2.6 under a general time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + 4 + I). Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV sequences belonging to the recently described novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015) [7, 10] are shown in expanded view. The 6 sequences identified in this study are marked with circles, and those colored red highlight the 4 cases linked to Hospital A. The sequence from the case with the 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion in open reading frame (ORF)5 is marked with \u0394. Clade-credibility values \u226570% are indicated above the respective nodes. Numbers in brackets after some strain identifiers are the number of identical sequences with the same geographic location and sample collection year/month. The scale bar shows the genetic distance as nucleotide substitutions per site. Weeks are WHO epidemiologic weeks; week 35 is truncated at August 31, 2015.",
