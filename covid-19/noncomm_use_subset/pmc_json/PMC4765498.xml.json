The\neosinophilic granules are similar to those seen in other epithelia e.g. upper and\nlower respiratory tract or pancreas (Leininger et al. 1999; Renne et al. 2009). Once thought to be accumulation\nof mucosubstances or pepsinogen, they have been shown to be composed of a Ym1/Ym2 a\nchitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation (Ward et al. 2001; Rogers and Houghton 2009).\nThe use of the term hyalinosis for this lesion will potentially cause confusion in\nsafety assessment as the same term may also be used for a distinctly different\nclinical disorder in humans and can be used to describe vascular and renal\nglomerular changes.",

The villous epithelium is composed of tall columnar\ncells with surface microvilli (the main absorptive cells), goblet cells containing mucus\nand scattered neuroendocrine cells covering a lamina propria composed of connective tissue\nwith a rich vascular and lymphatic network. The lamina propria contains variable numbers\nof lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, eosinophils and/or mast cells whilst occasional\nintraepithelial lymphocytes can also be observed. Paneth cells, which have an exocrine\nserous morphology and produce antimicrobial peptides, are present in higher numbers in the\ncrypts of jejunum and ileum compared to the duodenum. Brunner\u2019s glands, which produce a\nbicarbonate rich secretion, are present in the submucosa immediately following the\npyloric-duodenal junction. Villi in the duodenum are taller than those in jejunum and\nileum. Jejunum and ileum can be hard to differentiate in cross section except that the\nterminal ileum has two serosal attachments (mesentery and ligamentum ileocecale) compared\nto the single mesenteric attachment of the jejunum. With age, the duodenal villi tend to\nbecome shorter and thicker due to increased amounts of fibrous connective tissue in the\ncore, whilst those in the ileum become longer probably related to reduced absorption in\nthe proximal intestine resulting in greater amounts of nutrients passing into the distal\nintestine (Shackelford and Elwell\n1999).",

Alternatively the whole length of the intestine can be fixed using the\nSwiss roll method. However, opening the intestine and washing away contents with normal\nsaline brings the risk of damaging the delicate mucosa which degenerates quickly due to\npost mortem autolysis; tissue orientation may be less reliable during subsequent tissue\ntrimming and blocking using this method.

Hypersensitivity reactions\nmay play a role in test article induced inflammatory reactions, for example\ntrinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten and induces a severe granulomatous\nreaction in the distal colon (Haschek et al. 2010). Because of the presence of numerous commensal\nbacteria in the intestine, there is the potential for secondary invasion of sites of\nmucosal injury and an exacerbation of any tissue injury and induction of an\ninflammatory response. Inflammatory lesions can be induced by pathogenic bacteria\ne.g. salmonella, Citrobacter freundii, Helicobacter spp or viruses (norovirus, mouse\nhepatitis virus) if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals\n(Maggio-Price et al.\n2005; Percy and\nBarthold 2007).

In the mouse it is predominantly seromucinous, where as, in\nthe rat it is mostly mucinous with a small serous component (Gresik, 1994; Ozono et al. 1991; Tucker,\n2007)). The submandibular gland is comprised of several adenomeres with\nlarge pyramidal mucous cells that are flanked basally by variable\nnumbers of cresentric serous demilunes. The large pyramidal mucous cells\nhave abundant vesicular basophilic cytoplasm and basally located nuclei and the cresentric\nserous demilunes have scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic\nnuclei. The acinar secretions from the adenomeres empty into intercalated\nducts lined by low cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells. Few\noncocytes are interspersed between the cuboidal epithelial cells of the\nintercalated ducts of aged rats. These cells are characterized by abundant granular\neosinophilic cytoplasm (abundant mitochondria) and a central hyperchromatic nucleus. Thin\nfusiform myoepithelial cells are located between the basal lamina and\nepithelial cells of acini and intercalated ducts (Bogart, 10970; Sashima, 1986).\nOnly in the submandibular gland, the intercalated ducts continue into granular\n(convoluted) ducts. The granular ducts are lined by tall columnar epithelial\ncells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. The granulation of these ducts is\nmuch more prominent in sexually mature males when compared to females (Figures 156 and 157). These ducts continue into striated (intralobular) ducts that are\nlined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells with marked basal infoldings\n(hence, striated cells) and central to apically located nuclei. Several of the striated\n(intralobular) ducts merge into interlobular excretory ducts that are\nlined by tall columnar epithelial cells with more apically located nuclei and prominent\ncytoplasmic striations. Several interlobular excretory ducts continue into one\nmain excretory duct that expands into a diverticulum lined by simple\ncolumnar epithelium and end as squamous epithelium at the oral surface.",

            "text": "The salivary secretions are tightly regulated by the sympathetic (adrenergic) and\nparasympathetic (cholinergic) nervous system (Garrett 1987). Most cell types within the submaxillary and parotid glands have\nboth sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations while the sublingual glands have scant\nsympathetic innervation limited to striated ducts and blood vessels (Garrett et al. 1991). The parasympathetic system and\nthe \u03b1-adrenergic sympathetic system regulate the water and inorganic ion phase of the\nprimary secretory fluid, whereas the \u03b2-adrenergic sympathetic system effects primarily the\nmacromolecular (enzymes) phase. Parasympathetic stimulation is mainly responsible for\nstimulation of the salivary acini resulting in copious secretion of saliva, however, the\nsympathetic stimulation does not inhibit salivary secretion but it modulates the saliva\ncomposition and causes salivary secretion to a lesser extent (Proctor and Carpenter 2007). The sympathetic and\nparasympathetic stimulation of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the acini results in\ncontraction of acini and directing the saliva into the ducts (Tucker 2007). Surprisingly, it is the sympathetic stimulation\nbut not parasympathetic stimulation that results in morphologically obvious depletion of\nstorage granules within the acini (Garrett\net al. 1991). \u03b2-adrenergic sympathomimetic agonists such as isoprenaline (Selye et al. 1961) and terbutaline (Sodicoff et al. 1980) first cause\nrapid depletion of secretory granules and later promotes re-synthesis of secretory\nmaterial leading to acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. On the other hand,\n\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists like propranolol suppress salivary secretions and eventually\ncause acinar atrophy (Fukuda 1968).",

It may be an age related lesion or may be induced\nexperimentally, usually as a secondary response after obstruction of excretory ducts\nor after alteration of trophic factors. Examples for obstruction of excretory ducts\ninclude ligation (Bhaskar et al.\n1956; Standish and\nShafer 1957), sialoliths and foreign bodies. Testosterone,\nadrenocorticoids, and sympathetic stimulation are important trophic factors for the\nsalivary glands. Any experimental condition that acts on their homeostasis may\npotentially induce diffuse salivary gland atrophy. This has been shown for\nhypophysectomy (Koerker 1967),\nadrenalectomy, denervation and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. Also decreased food\nconsumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. Atrophy of\nsalivary glands due to liquid diet affects parotid and submandibular glands but the\nsublingual glands are apparently spared (Hall and Schneyer 1964; Scott and Gunn 1991). Also, the sublingual glands\nlack sympathetic innervation and thus are spared in situations where the chemicals\nact on the sympathetic nervous system. Salivary gland atrophy was noted in F344 rats\ntreated with sodium dichromate dihydrate (NTP,\n2008). Often, salivary atrophy is accompanied by mild chronic inflammation\nand mild interstitial fibrosis.",

The sublingual glands are reportedly\nspared from pathologic changes in SDAV infections (Jacoby 1985). However, the sublingual excretory ducts may\nhave ductal squamous metaplasia in the absence of SDAV infections. Vitamin A\ndeficient diet induced squamous metaplasia in the ducts of parotid, submandibular\nand sublingual glands in Sprague-Dawley rats (Horn et al. 1996). Squamous cell metaplasia in the\nsubmandibular gland was described in mice after treatment with DMBA and was proven\nto be of ductal segment origin by the presence of keratin proteins (Takai et al. 1986).",

Though, squamous cell metaplasia of the ductular epithelium has been\nconsidered as a preneoplastic condition progressing to neoplasia (Neuenschwander and Elwell\n1990), the potential for progression of hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia\nof the ductular epithelium is unclear. These changes in the sublingual gland of\nWistar rats, often associated with inflammation/fibrosis, were not associated with\nneoplasia at that site (Van Esch et\nal. 1986). In addition, treatment-related squamous cell metaplasia of the\nsalivary gland in a chronic F344 rat study with iodinated glycerol was not\nassociated with neoplastic findings in the salivary gland after two years (NTP, 1990). Squamous cell metaplasia was induced\nwith chlorodibromomethane in F344 rats but not in B6C3F1 mice after 13-week\ntreatment, but no tumor progression was noted after 2 years treatment (Dunnick et al. 1985). On the\nother hand, transition of squamous metaplasia into squamous cell carcinoma in the\nsubmandibular gland via a non-genotoxic, proliferation-dependent mechanism was\npostulated after 2-year treatment with potassium iodide in F344 rats (Takegawa et al. 1998). In\naddition, in experiments with implanted sponge pellets containing DMBA inducing\nsquamous cell carcinomas in Sprague-Dawley rats, the authors concluded that ductal\nsegments undergoing squamous cell metaplasia may have participated in the genesis of\nneoplasia during experimental carcinogenesis (Cao et al. 2000, Sumitomo et al. 1996).",

Also PTAH staining will aid in\nconfirmation of the intracytoplasmic fibrils within the myoepithelial cells (Botts et al. 1999; Sundberg et al. 1991). They are\nnegative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin immunohistochemistry, in contrast to\nnormal myoepithelial cells; furthermore, Sundberg et al. has suggested that the\nneoplasms arise from a subset of extraglandular ductal myoepithelial cells that are\nnegative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin (Sundberg et al. 1991). Such confirmatory stains\nmay be required for differentiation of myoepitheliomas from scirrhous/anaplastic\nsquamous cell carcinomas or mixed malignant tumors.",

Acinar atrophy may range from focal atrophic\nexocrine acini with no inflammation or fibrosis to diffuse atrophy of exocrine acini\nwith replacement by adipose tissue and residual ducts, vasculature and islets of\nLangerhans. Acinar atrophy frequently represents the sequel of chronic inflammation\nand, as such, is often accompanied by infiltrates of mononuclear cells and fibrosis.\nIt is recommended to record in standard toxicity studies for such lesions either\natrophy or chronic inflammation, but not both. Inflammation, chronic, should be\nrecorded only, if the inflammatory changes are the predominant component. In rats,\nthe acinar atrophy increases with age and the incidence varies with sex (males >\nfemales) and strain (BN/Bi/WAG/Rij(F1) > Crl:CD(SD)BR = BN/Bi > Slc:Wistar\n> Hap:(SD) > F344 > Osborne-Mendel). In B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of\nspontaneous exocrine pancreatic atrophy is 1\u20132% in 2-year studies (Boorman and Sills 1999). In\nrats, chronic protein or essential amino acid deficiency, copper deficiency, zinc\ndeficiency, ethionine, hypophysectomy or high doses of glucagon induce loss of\nzymogen granules and pancreatic atrophy (Svoboda et al. 1966; Kitagawa and Ono 1986; Rao et al. 1987; Koo and Turk 1977). Malonaldehyde caused atrophy of\nexocrine pancreas in both male and female mice (NTP, 1988). Acinar atrophy has also been induced by pancreatic duct\nligation (Watanabe et al.\n1995; Eustis et al.\n1990).",

Basophilic foci occur also in\nmice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats (Roebuck et al. 1980). There is an increase in the\nincidence of basophilic foci in rats treated with 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline-1-oxide\n(4HAQO), 7,12-dimethyl-benzanthracene (DMBA),\nN5-(N-methyl-N-nitrosocarbamoyl)-L-ornithine (MNCO), raw soy bean flour, plant\ntrypsin inhibitors, and azaserine. The proliferative ability of exocrine acinar\ncytological alterations as measured by tritiated thymidine autoradiography and\nmitotic index indicated that basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as\nthe surrounding normal exocrine acini (Rao et al. 1989). Thus, unlike focal hyperplasia, the basophilic foci\nshould not be considered as preneoplastic (Scarpelli et al. 1984). The cytologic\nappearance of acinar cells within the basophilic foci may indicate an altered\ncapacity for, or a defect in, the synthesis of secretory proteins. Basophilic foci\nstained positively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase (GGT) while eosinophilic foci\nstained negatively. A microscopic morphological entity described as spontaneous\npancreatic acinar hypertrophic foci in rats by Chiu (Chiu 1983) may indeed be basophilic foci because they share\nseveral features such as increased incidence with age, and they are non-hyperplastic\nand non-neoplastic.",
