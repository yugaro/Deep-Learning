Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) has been the most commonly used laboratory diagnostic assay for ZIKV infection worldwide. A number of specific real-time and conventional RT-PCR assays targeting the envelope (E), premembrane (prM), nonstructural proteins 1 (NS1), NS2B, NS3, and NS5 gene coding regions of the ZIKV genome have been described [18\u201324]. However, most of these assays were developed before the ZIKV epidemic occurred in the Americas, and there are up to 10 potential nucleotide mismatches between the sequences of the individual assays\u2019 primers and current epidemic virus strains [25]. The low sensitivity in these assays may also lead to false-negative results in up to 20\u201380% of patients, especially those with low viral loads in their blood or urine [25].",

Presumed causes of cross-reaction of Zika RDT to DENV may be caused by mixed infection of ZIKV and DENV both in vectors and in human, and overlapping clinical symptoms make differential diagnosis a problem. ZIKV and DENV show a higher than 50% homology in E and NS1 proteins [38], and these common antigenic determinants may confuse the issue. Pre-existing immunity to prior DENV infection might also increase ZIKV replication through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection [40] causing variable results. In this context, cross-reactivity between DENV and ZIKV seems inevitable. Indeed, it has been suggested that ZIKV must be considered another member of the DENV serocomplex [40].",

(Cheonan, Korea). As it has been proved to be effective in the field, promotion of ZIKV test for public healthcare awareness has been facilitated. The Zika RDT kit is very simple to use, rapid to assay, and very sensitive and highly specific. Therefore, it would serve as a choice of method for point-of-care diagnosis and large scale surveys of ZIKV infection among people under clinical or field conditions worldwide in endemic areas.",

The need to differentiate these infections in a single sample for both clinical and epidemiologic purposes is of immediate importance and is likely to remain relevant in the future. Additionally, the relationship between ZIKV variants and severe complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome also need to be addressed, and our test seems flexible enough to detect these variants.",
