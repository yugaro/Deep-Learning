A classic and often quoted exchange between Alice and that precocious egg revolves around the usage and definition of words. Humpty Dumpty has a rather egocentric approach to terminology: \u2018\u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean\u2014neither more nor less.\u201d\u2019 On hearing this, Alice was \u201ctoo much puzzled to say anything\u201d (1). Needless to say, in our day-to-day interactions, Humpty Dumpty\u2019s approach to dialog is not a viable option. Unlike him, we do not sit isolated and alone on top of a wall. Rather, we inhabit a world where communication is rapid and clarity is critical. Lack of precision leads to misunderstandings which can be rapidly amplified in retweets, likes, and shares. Before you know it, scientists, governments, the media, and the public are like Alice, simply puzzled.",

Canvassing the opinions of microbiologists before that meeting made it apparent that they are uncharacteristically united in their dislike of the term \u201cgain of function\u201d (GOF). This is understandable and hardly surprising since it is not a term that they typically use. What is probably more interesting is that even though the consensus of opinion is that this terminology is getting in the way and that moving away from a phrase which has been hijacked to describe a small set of influenza virus experiments would be useful, how to address this problem is much less obvious, especially since the term has been coopted by general media and appears to have acquired a meaning of its own. Boundaries between biosecurity and biosafety have been blurred, and a debate which began with concerns about nefarious use has meandered in the direction of laboratory accidents and biocontainment errors. Through Humpty\u2019s explanations in the poem \u201cJabberwocky\u201d of words such as \u201cmimsy\u201d (flimsy and miserable) to Alice, Lewis Carroll is credited with introducing yet another new definition into the lexicon. \u2018\u201cYou see it\u2019s like a portmanteau,\u201d said Humpty, \u201cthere are two meanings packed up into one word.\u201d\u2019 At the recent NSABB meeting in an effort to move toward more-acceptable terminology, the portmanteau \u201cgain of function of concern\u201d was suggested. As attractive as this moniker might be when written, it quickly became clear to the committee that \u201cGoFoC\u201d when spoken might not quite \u201cfly.\u201d",

This is not the place to provide a blow-by-blow account of how we ended up at the point where the U.S. Government instigated a \u201cpause\u201d on new and a voluntary cessation of ongoing/funded virology experiments. However, to understand where we are demands some appreciation of how virology began, the types of questions virologists ask, and the approaches that they use. Long before virology existed as a discipline or before scientists knew what viruses were, people observed what administration of filtered contagium vivum fluidum did in a natural host. Transmission experiments in plants and animals led to reproducible diseases, and such approaches were foundational in showing the absolute requirement of living cells for virus growth. Eggs (although not of the Humpty variety) were pivotal, as they provided a novel cellular substrate for the culture of influenza viruses. Subsequent development of in vitro cell culture systems opened the door for virologists to bring dangerous pathogens into the laboratory. What is important to appreciate is that these approaches established a basic principle in virology: the use of unnatural cell substrates to culture viruses. As viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that infect bacteria, plants, animals, and humans, the very act of introducing a virus into a new environment will drive evolutionary adaptations. Changes in the genome during tissue culture adaptation lead to alterations in the phenotype as functions are gained and lost. This fact seems to have been lost in the ongoing debate into the creation of novel viruses, and it is both simplistic and incorrect to apply the term \u201cgain of function\u201d to a small subset of influenza transmission experiments. How did we find ourselves in this lexiconic morass? By not appreciating the history of virology, by not recognizing that \u201cgain of function\u201d is a term used by geneticists, not virologists, and by not nipping usage of this misnomer in the bud from the outset.",

However, we contend that this is a defeatist approach, and rather than complain about the problems of the past will suggest more-precise terminology which could be used in the future. In fact, changes in the common lexicon in recent years show that terminology can indeed be altered, as evidenced by the switch from \u201cstewardess\u201d to \u201cflight attendant,\u201d \u201chandicapped\u201d to \u201cdisabled,\u201d and \u201cthird world\u201d to \u201cunderresourced,\u201d if there is a need for better usage.

The first is easy to address, as DURC simply represents a subset of DUR (Fig. 1A). DURC is defined as \u201clife sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misused to pose a significant threat with broad consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, or national security\u201d (2). Currently, DURC focuses on 15 select agents, 8 viruses, 6 bacteria, and 1 toxin (Fig. 1B), and includes human, animal, zoonotic, and synthetically generated pathogens, such as variola major virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus, and Ebola virus (Fig. 1C). Three have been eradicated from general circulation, although rinderpest virus would be very straightforward to reconstruct using reverse-genetics approaches published 20 years ago, synthetic biology, and wild-type genome sequences which are in the public domain (3, 4). Although influenza virus has not been eradicated by vaccination, reverse genetics was used to synthesize the H1N1 influenza virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic (5). Based on a predication that there are approximately 320,000 mammalian viruses (6), the list of DURC-relevant viruses represents a mere 0.0025%. Furthermore, the \u201cGOF\u201d-research of concern represents a minuscule fraction of the virological research portfolio and is usually only thought of as influenza transmission studies (Fig. 1D, red circle). Interestingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses are not on the DURC list, even though work with these is also subject to the \u201cpause.\u201d This demonstrates that in practice, DURC is wider than a list of pathogens and illustrates the broader impact on microbiological research of this debate.",

Selection processes are used to alter wild-type phenotypes making this word a more appropriate descriptor for any change in function. It covers both loss and gain and recognizes an important part of any selection process; there is often a trade-off such that as one function is acquired or enhanced, another function is concomitantly lost or reduced. This is illustrated for all of virology (Fig. 1D). For example, a human virus passaged in animal cells can adapt to a different receptor and/or intracellular factors and can infect more cell types than the wild-type virus (gain of function). However, these and other adaptive mutations can lead to a decrease in virulence as the process of pathogenesis is altered (loss of function). Live attenuated vaccines can be placed in the yellow section, as by definition a key goal of the selection process is loss of virulence, but a consequence of passage is a gain of infectivity and a change in tropism. This example illustrates the fundamental problem of focusing exclusively on one function and one virus. Most of the discussion has centered on the gain of transmission of influenza leading to a situation where the proverbial \u201ctail is wagging the dog.\u201d This is why we need to define not just one but all of the \u201cF\u2019s.\u201d",

Agreeing which functions to focus on is also relatively easy, as the DURC policy is clear. From the seven categories of experiments requiring oversight, six identify functions of concern and one focuses on (i) reconstructing pathogens which have been eradicated or (ii) reconstituting viruses no longer in general circulation. Synthetic reconstruction from published sequences or reconstitution from archived clinical samples is simple to regulate at the level of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) or institutional review entity (IRE). It is expected that any such body would point out that work with rinderpest or smallpox virus as part of an NIH application is not permissible. However, more in-depth discussions are required between review committees and a researcher who seeks permission to perform microbiological experiments which aim to alter one or more of the six functions of concern. Increases in transmission, range, infectivity, pathogenesis, resistance to a therapeutic agent, and disruption of immunity are the functions which demand attention (Fig. 1E). For some, gain of function causes the most concern, although even for the influenza transmission studies, it is simplistic to focus on only one phenotype/one function as a range or on infectivity changed during selection of mammal-adapted avian influenza viruses. Once again, this highlights why \u201cGOF\u201d is such a vague term. Conversely, loss of function, such as the ability to be neutralized by an antibody, inhibited by a drug, or detected by a diagnostic assay, also raises significant concern.",

Although potentially applicable to all of microbiology, it should be used to identify only the small subset of experiments with prescribed pathogens which may produce data relevant for biosecurity (Fig. 1D, red circle). Focusing on alterations to explicit phenotypes will help scientists think holistically during experimental design and assist members of the IBC/IRE during application evaluation.

They argue that opponents of the research do not recognize the functionality of existing biocontainment practices or appreciate the extensive risk mitigation practices currently in place to permit microbiologists to work with dangerous pathogens safely. The subtle shift in focus from biosecurity to biosafety issues also leads to confusion and once again illustrates why using precise terminology is critical. Microbiologists should not be complacent and must be open to suggestions and approaches from other fields. Meaningful, quantifiable, evidence-based assessments are not a threat to research.

Furthermore, gain of function is often accompanied by loss of function and vice versa (yellow shading). (E) Alterations in phenotype which give cause of concern can include loss and gain of function.",
