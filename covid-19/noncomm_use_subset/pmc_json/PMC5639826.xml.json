While there has been some success in limiting the spread of CWD in wild populations through strategic culling, this is an incomplete and controversial strategy for long-term disease management.6,7 Management of CWD, in particular within wild populations, will likely depend on the coordinated application of several disease management strategies. One important component of this strategy may be the use of vaccines to either reduce PrPSc shedding or prevent infection. In particular, the unique ability of prions to cause long-term environmental contamination, lasting from years to decades, supports vaccination as a strategy to both achieve prophylactic prevention and reduce shedding towards mitigating exposure and infection of animals in contaminated environments.8,9 Emerging evidence of the uptake and presentation of environmentally-shed prions by plants further support the importance of limiting shedding by infected animals.10",

For wild animals, an effective vaccine would need to be deployed without direct contact with animals, making oral vaccines the best delivery option. The potential benefits of oral vaccination are perhaps best exemplified by the highly-successful example of rabies that demonstrated it is possible to achieve protective immunity through oral, self-administered vaccines.40,41 Different molecular and biological vectors have been investigated as oral CWD vaccines and these studies have demonstrated that oral vaccine formulations can induce both mucosal and systemic antibody responses in deer and mice.24-27 Perhaps most relevant, Goni et al, using a Salmonella-based oral delivery platform in deer, were able to induce partially protective immune responses to CWD.25 This, however, was achieved with an intensive immunization protocol (8 immunizations, including specific manual application of the vaccine to the tonsils) that would limit the potential for application of this approach in a wildlife setting. Optimistically this study provides proof-of-principle support for the development of an oral CWD vaccine while highlighting the need for delivery platforms that are compatible with a real-world wildlife vaccine from economic, regulatory and practical considerations.",

One of the 5 vaccinated animals failed to seroconvert at any time during the trial. The ability of oral hAd5:tgG-RL vaccine to induce mucosal responses was also evaluated following oral immunization. DSE-specific antibody responses were detected in 4 of the 5 animals receiving hAd5:tgG-RL [Fig. 2B]. The overall kinetics of the fecal antibody responses mirrored the serum antibody response.

Shedding of the hAd5 vector was limited to three days immediately following vaccination. In contrast, shedding could be detected for weeks following oral delivery of a replication-competent vector.47 That the replication-defective vector was able to infect cells in the gastro-intestinal tract of white-tailed deer and express the transgene was evident in the induction of RL-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses.

Based on virus shedding, we can be confident that the non-responding animal (An3) received the vaccine but (based on the splenocyte proliferation assays and antibody titres) did not mount an immunological response to the vaccine. There are a number of potential explanations for this vaccine non-responder. Firstly, it is important to appreciate that the purpose of this investigation was to provide proof-of-principle for the development of an oral vaccine for cervids utilizing vectors that are consistent with a real-world vaccine from financial and regulatory perspectives. This did not include efforts to optimize either the dose or timing of the vaccinations which could certainly impact the magnitude and consistency of the induced responses. As such, it may be possible to achieve a more prominent and uniform response through optimizing the dose and/or timing of vaccination.

Further, with the oral vaccine, there wasn't a significant anamnestic response following the secondary immunization. This may be due to the induction of hAd5-specifc immunity, which prevented virus infection or uptake by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. The parenteral DSE-specific vaccine induced antibody responses that were also detectable in nasal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid.36 The failure of the oral vaccine to induce detectable humoral responses within either nasal secretions or CSF [data not shown] may be attributable to the induction of a much lower systemic antibody response. There are several options to increase the immunogenicity, and potentially protective capacity, of the hAd5 vector. These include optimizing the dose and timing of vaccination as well as incorporating accessory immunostimulatory proteins in the transgene, chemical modification or encapsulation of the recombinant virus to decrease degradation in gastrointestinal tract, and possibly reducing interference by vector immunity by increasing the interval between multiple immunizations.48-50",
