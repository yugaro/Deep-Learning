            "text": "A large number of virus genomes have been engineered to carry additional sequences for a variety of purposes. Viruses are often used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or the natural host. For example, the baculovirus expression system is widely used for expression work (Chambers et al. 2018), lentiviruses show great promise for gene therapy (Milone and O\u2019Doherty 2018), and phage display allows for selection of desired epitopes (Wu et al. 2016). Marker genes have also been built into viruses to facilitate tracking infection spread (Dolja, McBride, and Carrington 1992). As viruses evolve rapidly, including the incorporation of genome-rearrangements, it is therefore unsurprising that the insertion of sequences into viral genomes often goes hand in hand with the rapid occurrence of deletions (Koonin, Dolja, and Morris 1993; Pijlman et al. 2001; Zwart et al. 2014). The inserted sequence, and sometimes parts of the viral genome, are then rapidly lost. This genomic instability can have economic ramifications, leading to decreases in heterologous protein expression (Kool et al. 1991; De Gooijer et al. 1992; Scholthof, Scholthof, and Jackson 1996). It can also introduce limitations and complications to working with marker genes (Dolja et al. 1993; Majer, Dar\u00f2s, and Zwart 2013). Understanding the stability of inserted sequences therefore has value from an applied perspective, but it could also shed light on basic questions. First, how stable are natural virus genomes, and under what conditions do they become unstable? Second, since horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in virus evolution, under what conditions are transferred sequences likely to be retained?",

First, we provide an overview of empirical results which shed light on insert-sequence stability for viruses, based on the Baltimore classification. Second, we present some conceptual considerations pertaining to sequence stability, identifying important parameters for understanding and potentially predicting stability. We identify theory and experiments that point toward viable strategies for mitigating the rapid loss of inserted genes, and point out key questions that should be addressed in future research. We argue that virus genome organization has a large impact on the stability of inserted sequences, whilst stability is a complex trait that can depend on environmental conditions.",

The inverted terminal repeats of vaccinia virus undergo rapid changes in size due to unequal crossover events leading to stable and unstable forms (Moss, Winters, and Cooper 1981). The diversity in this region is needed for immune evasion and for the colonization of novel hosts and appears to be mainly regulated by recombination events. However, other processes such as mutation leading to accelerated rates of recombination cannot be ruled out.",

These viruses have larger than average genome sizes and the more recently discovered giant viruses are also classified as such. The NCLDVs appear to have undergone a dynamic evolution where gene gain and loss events go in parallel with host-switches between animal and protist hosts (Koonin and Yutin 2018). Interestingly, the phylogenomic reconstructions performed by Koonin and Yutin (2018) suggest that giant viruses (for which the host range appears to be restricted to protists) have evolved from simpler viruses (infecting animals) on many independent occasions. This again suggests that the host plays an important role in genome stability where in animals the pressure for smaller virus genomes is stronger than in protists (Koonin and Yutin 2018).",

After deletion of one host range gene of vaccinia virus, another host range gene increases in copy number (Elde et al. 2012), leading to genomic expansion. The increased gene expression is in itself beneficial, but the high gene copy number also increases the supply of beneficial gain-of-function mutations. Once these gain-of-function mutations are fixed in the population, the other copies of the gene are lost and thus the vaccinia genome size decreased (associated with the cost of an increased genome size) (Elde et al. 2012), leading to accordion-like evolutionary dynamics (Andersson, Slechta, and Roth 1998).",

Nonetheless, during serial passaging defective interfering (DI) baculoviruses that lack large portions of the genome are rapidly produced, in what appears to be an intrinsic property of baculovirus infection (Pijlman et al. 2001). As a result of having a smaller genome size, these DIs most likely have a replicative advantage (higher fitness). Especially in bioreactor configurations where the cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI, the number of virus particles infecting a cell) is high, faster-replicating DIs can rapidly reach high frequencies (Kool et al. 1991). The rapid generation of DIs involves several recombination steps and prevents the development of stable baculovirus expression vectors, as inserted sequences are then also rapidly lost (Pijlman et al. 2001).",

Among dsDNA phages, lambdaviruses of E.coli were widely used as cloning vectors, and methods were developed to increase the stability and maximum size of inserts (Chauthaiwale, Therwath, and Deshpande 1992). One interesting approach made use of the fact that there is a minimum genome size for efficient packaging into virus particles. When endogenous genes that are non-essential for the lytic cycle are removed, not only can larger sequences be inserted, but there is also selection for maintaining the inserted sequences because they increase genome size and enable packaging (Thomas, Cameron, and Davis 1974). Moreover, it has been shown that phage T7 engineered with a biofilm-degrading enzyme (dispersin B) was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short-term biofilms (Lu and Collins 2007). Although providing a \u2018public\u2019 benefit in the form of an exoenzyme that can degrade host defenses, surprisingly this insertion does not have a cost and is therefore stable (Schmerer et al. 2014). Interestingly, the insertion of an endosialidase at the same locus was both beneficial and costly, although in this case evolutionary stability was not determined (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012).",

During the course of geminivirus infection in plants, shorter subgenomic DNAs often arise. These subgenomic DNAs can range in size and some result in defective DNAs (Stenger et al. 1992; Stanley et al. 1997; Patil et al. 2007), that replicate at the expense of the full-length genome. These subgenomic DNAs can lead to reduced symptom severity in plants and thereby act as modulators of viral pathogenicity. It is speculated that the (sometimes stepwise) deletion process leading to subgenomic DNAs can also be the process leading to the reversion to wild-type full-length DNA molecules with either insertions or deletions that make these bigger or smaller than the wild-type genome (Martin et al. 2011).",

Deletion mutants of the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) have also shown to revert back to the original wild-type genome length through recombination between the two components of the bipartite genome (Etessami, Watts, and Stanley 1989). The selection pressure on the reversion to wild-type genome length is probably a strong size constraint on encapsidation, where in the case of ACMV the size of encapsidated DNA determines the multiplicity of geminivirus particles (Frischmuth, Ringel, and Kocher 2001).",

A lower frequency would also entail a lower mutational supply, limiting evolvability, the capacity of the virus to generate beneficial variation and subsequently adapt.

            "text": "Poliovirus is a good candidate as a live viral vector for the expression of foreign genes, since the attenuated Sabin strains of poliovirus elicit strong protective immune responses without causing disease (Sabin 1957). Insertions of up to 534 bp of the rotavirus VP7 gene into Sabin 3 poliovirus gave rise to infectious viruses that expressed portions of the VP7 outer capsid protein (Mattion et al. 1994). This is promising as antibodies generated to VP7 are able to neutralize the virus. Nevertheless the size of the insert in this construction is limited as only inserts of about 300 bp or smaller were stable upon serial passages in tissue culture, whereas larger insertions failed to produce infectious viruses (Mattion et al. 1994). One of the major limitations appears to be the polyprotein nature of the genome. The recombinant viruses expressing the inserted gene were found to be slower in the assembly of infectious virus particles, and showed smaller plaques and lower virus titers. This is possibly due to slow cleavage at the artificial cleavage sites around the insert (Mattion et al. 1994). Sindbis virus, another ssRNA(+) virus genome that encodes for a single ORF, accepted relatively large inserts of 3.2 kbp in the 11.8 kbp genome (Pugachev et al. 1995). However, the recombinant Sindbis viruses appeared unstable and especially inserts at the 3\u2032 end were rapidly lost during serial passages, suggesting a positional effect.",

To cope with these issues, recombinant Flaviviridae viruses carrying the split-luciferase gene were generated (Tamura et al. 2018), including dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus. In vitro, these recombinant viruses appear to be evolutionary stable and propagation was comparable to the wild-type virus, most probably due to the small 11 amino acid insert size. To demonstrate the utility of the split reporter system\u2014to determine in vivo viral dynamics and the efficacy of antiviral reagents\u2014the recombinant HCV was tested in chimeric mice. Chronic infection was established and the luciferase gene was stably maintained in the viral genome (Tamura et al. 2018).",

This recombinant virus remained stable upon serial passaging in vitro, and induced higher ratios of Interleukin-4 and CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells in vivo. Despite the presumably better immune response of the host, the recombinant PRRSV vaccine did not significantly improve protection efficacy (Zhijun Li et al. 2015). In another attempt, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was inserted in a PRRSV vaccine strain. The inserted gene was stably expressed upon serial passaging in vitro, and the presence of GM-CSF led to increased surface expression of MHCI+, MHCII+, and CD80/86+ (Yu et al. 2014). Although evaluated solely in vitro, this recombinant strain is expected to elicit stronger immune responses and hereby improve vaccine efficacy against PRRSV infection.",

As an initial strategy to express foreign genes in plants, on many occasions viral genes were replaced with the gene of interest (gene replacement instead of gene insertion). This strategy appeared to be (partially) successful in plant ssDNA viruses (Hayes et al. 1988; Ward, Etessami, and Stanley 1988; Hayes, Coutts, and Buck 1989), as the replaced coat protein did not appear to play an essential role in virus spread throughout the plant host (Ward, Etessami, and Stanley 1988). However, viral ssRNA(+) genomes seem to be less plastic as the replacement strategy was mostly unsuccessful in plant RNA viruses. Although the RNA viral vectors permitted the expression of replaced genes, either they were only viable in protoplasts and not in whole plants (French, Janda, and Ahlquist 1986; Joshi, Joshi, and Ow 1990), or they were unable to establish systemic infections (Takamatsu et al. 1987; Dawson, Bubrick, and Grantham 1988).",

The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (Dawson et al. 1989), and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT) genes (Donson et al. 1991) were successfully expressed in plants by using Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a vector. In addition, the bacterial GUS gene has shown to successfully express when inserted into the viral genome of Potato virus X (PVX) (Chapman, Kavanagh, and Baulcombe 1992). However, in all these cases the presence of a foreign gene leads to genomic instability resulting in the partial deletion of the GUS and NPT genes and a complete deletion of CAT during systemic infection.

First, the positioning of the CAT gene downstream (instead of upstream) of the TMV coat protein, resulted in a poorly replicating virus that was not able to systematically infect the host plants (Dawson et al. 1989). And second, the DHFR gene (238 bp) inserted in a TMV background appears to be maintained stably through several passages, while the 3.5\u00d7 larger NPT gene (832 bp) in the same experimental setup was unstable during systemic movement of the virus. This may also be related to the nature of the insert, where sequences with a codon usage similar to that of the viral vector may be retained longer than those that have an opposite codon usage. Interestingly, Chung, Canto, and Palukaitis (2007) generated recombinant plant viruses with inserted genes of unrelated plant viruses and observed instability and variation in the rate of partial or complete loss of the insert depending on the inserted sequence itself, the host used, or the viral vector used (Chung, Canto, and Palukaitis 2007).

In this case eGFP can be considered a non-functional sequence, as it does not add any function to the viral genome. We showed that eGFP has a high fitness cost in TEV, and the loss of eGFP depended on the passage length, where longer passages led to a faster and assured loss. Similarly, prolonged propagation of TEV and plum pox potyvirus expressing GUS (Dolja, McBride, and Carrington 1992; Dolja et al. 1993; Guo, L\u00f3pez-Moya, and Garc\u00eda 1998), and TMV expressing GFP (Rabindran and Dawson 2001), led to the appearance of spontaneous deletion variants. Due to the increase in genome size, viruses that carry an insert are unlikely to be as fit as the parental (ancestral) virus, even if they accumulate initially to similar levels. The TEV-eGFP genomes that had lost the insert had a within-host competitive fitness advantage, where the smaller the genome the higher the within-host competitive fitness. Interestingly, although the size of the deletions varied, convergent evolution did occur in terms of fixed point mutations (Zwart et al. 2014). This result also suggests that a demographic \u2018sweet spot\u2019 exists, where heterologous insertions are not immediately lost while evolution can act to integrate them into the viral genome. In summary, in several studies passage duration has an effect on insert stability, with inserts being more stable in shorter passages. We explore these effects in the conceptual section presented at the end of this paper (see also Box 1). ",

A simulation model of the effects of genetic drift on insertion stability.Here we illustrate how demography can affect the observed stability of an inserted sequence, using a simulation model. This model is based on (Willemsen et al. 2016) and incorporates logistic virus growth, deterministic recombination with a fixed rate, and population bottlenecks after a given number of generations. To describe virus growth and recombination in each generation, two coupled ordinary differential equations are used: \n(1)dIdt=\u03c9II1-I + \u03c8DD\u03ba-\u03c1I,(2)dDdt=\u03c9DD1-D + \u03c8II\u03ba+\u03c1I.Here, I is the number of viruses with the insertion intact, D is the number of viruses with a deletion, \u03c9 is initial growth rate of each virus variant, \u03ba is the carrying capacity, \u03c1 is the rate at which I recombines to D, and \u03c8 is a constant for determining the effect of each virus on the others replication, with the effect of D on I being \u03c8D=\u03c9D/\u03c9I and vice versa \u03c8I=1/\u03c8D. The frequency of the deletion variant is fD=D/D+I. At the start of each passage, to simulate the bottleneck we draw the number I from a Binomial distribution with a size \u03b1 and success probability fD from the previous time point, and then D=\u03b1-I.To illustrate the effects of bottlenecks we chose the parameters in Table 2, set the initial fD to zero, and considered various values of \u03b1. The difference in fitness between the virus with insertion and without is large (\u03c9I/\u03c9D=0.8). The simulation data illustrate how under these conditions narrow bottlenecks can lead to stable inserted sequence (Fig. 2). During each round of passaging the frequency of the deletion variant comes up, but as it does not reach a frequency near 1/\u03b1 this variant is not sampled during the bottleneck. Only when the bottleneck is wider is the probability of sampling the virus variant with a deletion large enough for this to occur regularly. Once a deletion variant has been sampled during the bottleneck, it rapidly goes to fixation as it has a much higher fitness than the full-length virus. Figure 1 provides a simple illustration of the same principle.\n",

After over half a year of evolution in two semi-permissive host species, with a large difference in virus-induced virulence, the eGFP insert appears to remain stable. A fitness costs of eGFP was only found in the host for which TEV has low virulence. In the hosts for which TEV has high virulence there was no fitness cost and viral adaptation was observed. This contradicts theories that suggest that high virulence could hinder between-host transmission. When considering the evolution of genome architecture, host species jumps might play a very important role, by allowing evolutionary intermediates to be competitive.",

Using the TEV genome we simulated two HGT events, by separately introducing functional exogenous sequences that are potentially beneficial for the virus (Willemsen et al. 2017). In one case, the insertion was rapidly purged from the viral genome, restoring fitness to wild-type fitness levels. In another case, the inserted gene\u2014the 2b RNA silencing suppressor from Cucumber mosaic virus\u2014did not seem to have a major impact on viral fitness and was therefore not lost when performing experimental evolution. Interestingly this insertion duplicated the function of RNA silencing suppression function of another gene in the genome. When mutating this functional domain of the TEV gene, the inserted gene provided a replicative advantage. These observations suggest a potentially interesting role for HGT of short functional sequences in improving evolutionary constraints on viruses.",

On one hand, one would expect the duplicated copy to be rapidly deleted from the genome as it does not confer an additional function. On the other hand, if a duplicated sequence is stable it may act as a stepping stone to the evolution of new biological functions. We have investigated the stability of genetically redundant sequences by generating (TEV) viruses with potentially beneficial gene duplications (Willemsen et al. 2016). All gene duplications resulted in a loss of viability or in a significant reduction in viral fitness. Experimental evolution always led to deletion of the duplicated gene copy and maintenance of the ancestral copy. However, the stability of the different duplicated genes was highly divergent, suggesting that passage duration is not the main factor for determining whether the insert will be stable or unstable. The deletion dynamics of the duplicated genes were associated with the passage duration and the size of the duplicated copy. By developing a mathematical model we showed that the fitness effects alone are not enough to predict genomic stability. A context-dependent recombination rate is also required, with the context being the identity of the insert and its position.",

However, also here the insert size is limited, where the final virus titers in vitro are proportionally reduced as the insert size increases. While in vivo no such size-dependent effect was observed, an attenuated replication and pathogenicity were detected (Sakai et al. 1999). Insertions up to 3.9 kbp in the \u223c15.4 kbp genome of the human parainfluenza virus 3 were viable and replicated efficiently in vitro (Skiadopoulos et al. 2000).

In two of these studies, functional bacterial genes were introduced into the CaMV genome, where a fragment of the lac operator (Gronenborn et al. 1981) and the DHFR gene (Brisson et al. 1984) were successfully expressed. In these studies, issues regarding the stability of the insert were raised, where the lac operator was lost after five successive transfers and extended growth of the plants, and deletions in the DHFR gene started appearing after the second and third transfers. On the contrary, an inserted mammalian metallothionein gene appeared to be stable and functional in the CaMV genome (Lefebvre, Miki, and Lalibert\u00e9 1987). These studies suggest that the differences in stability of inserts in the CaMV genome depend on at least two factors. First, the site of the insert seems to be important as many inserts are lethal for the virus (Gronenborn et al. 1981; Howell, Walker, and Walden 1981; Dixon, Koenig, and Hohn 1983). Second, the size of the insert is important, as CaMV can accept only small foreign genes due to viral encapsidation limits (Gronenborn et al. 1981; Lefebvre, Miki, and Lalibert\u00e9 1987).",

However, the size of GFP is relatively large (around 700 nt) and often leads to instability of vectors (Zwart et al. 2014; Nakane, Iwamoto, and Matsuda 2015). To cope with the size limitation a split GFP system has been engineered (Cabantous, Terwilliger, and Waldo 2005), where only a small part of GFP is introduced in the viral vector and the other part is expressed using a transgenic host. When the two GFP fragments are together, spontaneous association leads the formation of a fluorescent molecule. In the CaMV genome this system allowed to track a CaMV protein in vivo (D\u00e1der et al. 2019). The partial GFP insertion was stable for ten or four serial passages, depending on the host plant species used, suggesting that the demographic conditions such as the host play an important role in stability.",

In this discussion we will consider virus populations that are divided into demes at the host or cell level. Theory suggests that demography could have major implications for the loss of inserted sequences, with small population sizes, narrow bottlenecks, and short time intervals between bottlenecks resulting in high sequence stability. Hence, the stability of the inserted sequence cannot be viewed solely as a property of a genome, rather it is a phenotype and therefore depends on the environment. In this section, we motivate this argument and present a simulation model that highlights the effects of demography on the deletion of inserted sequences.",

First, the supply of mutations removing the insertion is crucial, because selection can only act on existing heritable variation. Second, selection then acts to fix variants with the inserted sequence removed. All other things equal, the larger the supply of mutations that remove the insertion and the larger the selection coefficients of variants with the insert removed, the less stable the insertion will be. The interplay between mutation and selection will govern the stability of genomic inserts, and in many cases demography has an important role in shaping this interplay. For example, low fitness can lead to small population sizes, which in turn will limit the mutation supply (Chao 1990; Lynch and Gabriel 1990). A high-cost inserted sequence might therefore limit viral evolvability, thereby promoting its own stability.",

            "text": "Genetic drift can also play an important role in determining the stability of inserted sequences, as inserts can have high stability if a viral population regularly passes through population bottlenecks. This idea is inspired by the empirical observation that a group IV plant virus appears to be stable when short-duration passages are used, but not in long-duration passages (Dolja et al. 1993; Zwart et al. 2014; Willemsen et al. 2016, 2018). Viruses pass through bottlenecks at many points during infection, in vitro and in vivo (Zwart and Elena 2015), it is therefore important to consider these effects. Even if there is a large supply of deletions and strong selection for the deletion mutant, if deletion mutants fail to reach a frequency \u2265/\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the bottleneck size, they are unlikely to pass through the bottleneck (Willemsen et al. 2016, 2018). This leads to a \u2018resetting\u2019 of the virus population by each bottleneck event (Fig. 1), effectively resulting in high stability of the inserted sequences (Box 1, see also Fig. 2). Short passages shorten the time for deletion mutants to reach the frequency 1/\u03b1, making it more difficult for these variants to pass through bottlenecks and hereby promoting insert stability. It is important to remember that assays for detecting deletion mutants, such as deep sequencing or the polymerase chain reaction, do have limited sensitivity. Deletions may therefore also be detected more readily in longer passages, whilst low frequency mutations that will be purged by bottlenecks may not be detected (Bull, Nuismer, and Antia 2019).\n",

At high MOIs there will be no selection, because the toxin is produced in all cells and affects the replication of both producers and non-producers of the toxin (Fig. 3).

Beneficial effects could promote insertion stability and are therefore interesting from a bioengineering perspective, but demography can once again play a role in determining sequence stability. Heterologous expression of endosialidase, an exoenzyme that degrades a key biofilm component after phage-induced cell lysis, lead to increased amplification of phage T7 in capsulated E.coli (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012). However, a phage that did not express the dispersin outcompeted the engineered virus, as it could reap the benefits of dispersin production whilst not bearing costs. This tragedy of the commons is a reversal of the situation sketched above for high MOIs (Fig. 3). One proposed strategy to increase stability would be setting up culture conditions such that phages are growing in isolation or spatially structured environments (Gladstone, Molineux, and Bull 2012), other examples of demography-based approaches to increasing insert stability.",

For example, consider that recombination rates are high for many viruses (Tromas and Elena 2010), and there are many possible recombination events that partially remove an insertion. In contrast, probably only a small fraction of point mutations will be beneficial (Sanju\u00e1n, Moya, and Elena 2004; Carrasco, de la Iglesia, and Elena 2007), e.g. in this case by lowering expression of the inserted gene or leading to more favorable codon usage. We therefore conjecture that mutation supply is likely to favor the evolution of deletions in the transgene over beneficial point mutations that affect fitness cost. Consider the \u2018genomic accordion\u2019 observed in poxviruses (Elde et al. 2012): beneficial point mutations typically occur long after gene amplification by copy number variation. Likewise we expect deletions that remove an insertion to be fixed before point mutations that also lessen its impact occur. Nevertheless, the occurrence of alternative evolutionary trajectories could, depending on the exact mutation supply and effect sizes for different classes of mutations, contribute to making stability of genomic inserts less repeatable and predictable in some cases (De Visser and Krug 2014; Bolnick et al. 2018).",

Although the dsDNA (group I) virus genomes are extremely plastic in natural conditions, this observation is not a good predictor for stability of engineered viral genomes as inserts are generally lost. In the case of ssDNA (group II) viruses, the varying frequency of genomic segments might lead to rapid adaptive responses to inserted sequences. While in the case of segmented dsRNA (group III) viruses, sequence insertions probably perturb segmented genome assembly. When comparing the retro-transcribing viruses, the RT-ssRNA(+) (group VI) viruses appear to successfully express sequences of interest after stable integration into the host genome, whilst the RT-dsDNA (group VII) viruses are less stable and only rarely integrate into the host genome.

We have illustrated this idea with a simple simulation model that considers the effect of genetic bottlenecks (Box 1), where the observed stability of the viral genome decreases as the bottleneck is widened.

We hope to see developments in this area, possibly linked to resurging interest in preventing and exploiting DI viruses. However, we think that experimental tests of the stability of viral constructs will remain important in the foreseeable future. Experimental evolution can detect design problems in engineered genomes by looking at fitness and evolutionary stability (Springman et al.). As Springman and collaborators suggest, experimental evolution may also prove useful for optimizing the stability of expression vectors by ameliorating constraints for which solutions are hard to predict because we lack a mechanistic understanding, such as codon usage (Carrasco, de la Iglesia, and Elena 2007; Agashe et al. 2013). This approach can lead to improved engineering of viral genomes, which is also of interest for designing vectors with tags to follow viral infection, and for the use of viral vectors for gene therapy as well as for vaccine vectors. Finally, for real-world applications it can be useful to determine quantitatively the impact of the loss of inserted sequences on the desired output. For example, models suggest that deletions in vector vaccines may not have a large impact on eliciting the desired immune response (Bull, Nuismer, and Antia 2019).",

The ubiquitousness of the toxin will limit selection against the virus variant with the deletion. When MOI is low, due to genetic drift at the cellular not all cells will contain both variants, and virus variant with the deletion is selected because those cells infected only with this variant have higher replication. In panel B, the relationship between the cellular MOI (ordinate) and the frequency of single-genotype infection (abscissa) for a virus population with genotypes a and b is given, for different frequencies of the two virus genotypes in the population (fa shown, fb = 1 \u2013 fa). Note that the frequency of single-genotype infections is given as the proportion of infected cells in which only virus genotypes a or b are present. As the MOI increases, the frequency of single-genotype infections decreases, although it depends on the frequency of the two virus genotypes in the population.
