During infection with RNA viruses, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) bind viral PAMPs present in the infected cell and initiate a signaling cascade mediated by the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) molecule, which culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other antiviral proteins (4\u20136). This primary host response to infection is essential to control virus replication and to initiate protective antiviral immunity (7). Identification of viral structures that effectively trigger this pathway will advance our understanding of the molecular requirements for potent natural RIG-I ligands. Importantly, such knowledge can be used to generate synthetic RLR ligands for strong induction of antiviral responses in the context of vaccination or antiviral therapies.",

The delay in the detection of viral structures that are normally present in the viral genomes during natural infections indicates that additional factors are required for the effective triggering of antiviral responses in vivo. During infection with SeV, a potent stimulus for the initiation of the antiviral response is provided by immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs) generated during virus replication at high titers (23\u201325). SeV iDVGs trigger RLR signaling and initiate strong antiviral immunity both in vitro and during natural infections in vivo (24, 26). SeV iDVGs belong to the copy-back type of RNA DVGs and are produced when the viral polymerase is released from the template strand during replication and copies back the nascent strand (27). iDVGs are unable to replicate in the absence of a helper virus, as they lack the essential replication machinery and they are not transcribed into proteins due to their flanking antigenomic promoter (28\u201331). A copy-back iDVG of 546 nt (DVG-546) predominant in laboratory stocks of SeV strain Cantell (SeV C) is among the strongest natural triggers of RLR signaling (12, 23, 26, 32). Although this activity largely depends on 5\u2032-triphosphates and the presence of dsRNA structures, it is unclear whether additional RNA motifs optimize the immunostimulatory potential of DVG-546, contributing to its efficient recognition even in the presence of virus-encoded antagonists of the antiviral response (25, 33).",

Because copy-back DVGs maintain the promoter elements necessary for replication, both positive- and negative-sense DVG RNA strands are present in infected cells (Fig. 1C). To narrow the search for molecular motifs that confer strong stimulatory activity on iDVGs, we first assessed whether a specific strand of iDVG preferentially activates the host antiviral response during infection. We quantified the number of positive- and negative-sense RNA strands of a predominant iDVG (DVG-546) present during infection with SeV HD (12, 34) and correlated these amounts with IFNB1 mRNA expression. For the description and validation of this assay, see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental material. Although copy numbers of negative-sense DVG strands were consistently higher than those of positive-sense DVG strands throughout infection (see Fig. S1C), an increased ratio of positive- to negative-sense DVG strands positively correlated with the induction of IFNB1 expression in infected human A549 cells (Fig. 1D). The correlation between positive-sense DVG RNA and type I IFN expression was recapitulated in LLC-MK2 cells, a cell line highly permissive to SeV replication (see Fig. S1D). Confirming the strong ability of positive-sense DVG RNA to stimulate the antiviral response, RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with immunofluorescent staining showed that IRF3 translocation to the nucleus occurs predominantly in cells showing a strong positive-sense DVG signal (Fig. 1E and F). Thus, accumulation of positive-sense copy-back DVGs is positively associated with the induction of antiviral responses in cells infected with SeV.",

Specifically, we found that a mutant form of DVG (DVG-324) retaining the 5\u2032 end of the internal sequence promoted high levels of expression of type I IFNs upon transfection, while a mutant DVG missing the 5\u2032 end of the internal sequence (DVG-354) showed a significant loss of stimulatory ability. These data suggest that a specific region located at the 5\u2032 end of the internal sequence plays an essential role in maximizing the stimulatory potential of DVG RNA. Additional mutant DVGs further confirmed this prediction (Fig. 2A and B). One mutant DVG that retained a shorter 5\u2032 internal sequence (DVG-268) also showed potent immunostimulatory activity, while mutant DVGs lacking either the complete internal sequence (DVG-200) or both complementary sequences (DVG-IS) demonstrated a reduced ability to stimulate antiviral genes upon transfection into both mouse and human cells (Fig. 2B; see Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material). This differential activity of mutant DVGs was sustained over a 24 h time course, ruling out the possibility of different kinetics of IFN induction by the different mutant DVGs (see Fig. S2C). For all of these studies, in vitro-transcribed DVG (ivtDVG) RNAs were purified from gels, tested for purity and endotoxin content, and transfected into cells at equal molarity (see Fig. S3A to D).",

For in silico folding predictions, we excluded the 3\u2032 complementary sequence of the constructs since long complementarities strongly interfere with modeling based on minimal free energy, resulting in predicted structures that significantly deviate from the natural folding of the molecule (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, we identified a candidate stem-loop structure formed by nt 70 to 114 (DVG70-114) of DVG-546 that was observed only in mutant DVGs showing strong stimulatory ability (Fig. 2D). This region is enriched in A/U nucleotides compared to the positive-sense SeV genome or full-length DVG-546 (Fig. 2D). DVG70-114 spans the 3\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 complementary sequence and the 5\u2032 end of the internal sequence, consistent with a partial requirement for segments of the complementary and internal regions of iDVG for strong induction of IFN expression.",

By the time of DVG RNA transfection, viral protein mRNA, including NP and P/V, had accumulated to high levels in the cells (Fig. 3C; see Fig. S3E in the supplemental material) and no antiviral gene expression was detected (Fig. 3D, NT [nontransfected]).

Our cloning strategy preserved the RNA stem-loop structures present in both the DVG70-114 motif and the X region (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, transfection of the ivtDVG RNA X region DVG70-114 (X region-based mutant that includes DVG70-114) led to strong expression of IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA, while that of the X region alone did not (Fig. 5B). X region DVG70-114 also demonstrated an ability to stimulate antiviral gene expression equivalent to that of HCV poly(U/UC) (13) (Fig. 5B). To rule out the possibility that the potent activity of X region DVG70-114 resulted from the introduction of an additional stem-loop structure, independently of the sequence of the motif, we also cloned into the X region the auxiliary DVG5-51 motif which is not required for immunostimulatory activity of DVG RNA (Fig. 4G). DVG5-51 has a size similar to that of DVG70-114 and causes equivalent disruption of X region folding (Fig. 5A). Introduction of the DVG5-51 motif did not alter the stimulatory activity of the X region (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that DVG70-114 has exceptional and transferrable immunostimulatory potential.",

Similar to other DVG constructs (26), IFNB1 mRNA expression was dependent on MAVS and RIG-I activity for both mutant DVGs (Fig. 6A), while control poly (I:C) showed only MAVS, but not RIG-I, dependency. In addition, IFNB1 stimulation was largely dependent on the presence of uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphates (Fig. 6B) and on RNA secondary structures (Fig. 6C). To determine if the DVG70-114 motif augmented the binding of DVG RNA to RIG-I, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with DVG RNA exposed to purified RIG-I proteins that lacked the signaling (CARD) domain (RIG-I deltaCARD). RIG-I deltaCARD was used previously to characterize specific RNA binding signatures and demonstrated RNA binding affinity equivalent to that of the full-length parental protein (10, 35). We tested the binding affinity of RIG-I for iDVGs with or without DVG70-114 in the absence or presence of ATP, which promotes RIG-I polymerization upon association with RNA. DVG RNAs containing the DVG70-114 motif (DVG-268) were more profoundly displaced in the gels than RNAs lacking this motif (DVG-268\u039470-114 and DVG-200) in both the absence and the presence of ATP (Fig. 6D and E; see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material). These data indicate a stronger capacity of RNA containing the DVG70-114 motif to promote RIG-I binding and polymerization to high-molecular-weight complexes, essential events in RLR signaling (36\u201338). In addition, a slight enhancement of the binding capacity of RNAs containing the DVG70-114 motif to MDA5 deltaCARD was observed (see Fig. S6B), supporting previous reports of a supplementary role for MDA5 in the sensing of DVGs (33). Together, these results demonstrate that DVG70-114 facilitates the binding of viral RNAs to RLRs and is critical for effective triggering of RIG-I signaling in response to SeV iDVGs.",

Because of their outstanding stability, relatively short length, high degree of homogeneity, inability to replicate, and potential to be modified and targeted, iDVG-derived molecules are strong candidates for vaccine adjuvants and immunostimulatory additives for immunotherapy.

Similar stem-loop structures are found in other copy-back DVGs generated during infection with SeV C and 52 (data not shown), suggesting that structures similar to DVG70-114 provide enhanced immunostimulatory potential to other SeV iDVGs. Interestingly, folding modeling of the negative-sense strand of the molecule failed to predict the formation similar to DVG70-114 (not shown) corresponding to the observed correlation between the enhanced relative accumulation of positive-sense DVG in infected cells and type I IFN expression. These observations demonstrate that, in addition to the conventional 5\u2032-triphosphate motif, sequences and/or structures present in the positive-sense strand of the molecule maximize its immunostimulatory potential. It can be speculated that the lack of strong immunostimulatory potential on the negative-sense strand of DVG RNA reflects an evolutionary adaptation to avoid sensing of incoming particles before the establishment of infection; however, the biological relevance for a stronger stimulatory potential of one strand over the other requires further investigation.",

In addition, our data demonstrated that the 3\u2032 complementary sequence is not required for iDVG stimulatory activity. DVG-324NC (DVG-324 lacking the 3\u2032 complementary sequence) induced IFN expression equal to that of DVG-324, and this activity depended on intact DVG70-114. This result contradicts a previous study that shows a requirement for both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 complementary sequences for the maintenance of the immunostimulatory function of SeV DVGs (34).

These data demonstrate that DVG70-114 retains its stimulatory potential even outside the context of iDVGs. Our previous studies demonstrated that 5\u2032-triphosphates are necessary for nonself recognition of SeV iDVG by RIG-I (24). Here we show that 5\u2032-triphosphates are not sufficient and that optimal recognition occurs only in the presence of DVG70-114, as various mutant DVGs, including DVG-IS and DVG-200, maintain their 5\u2032-triphosphate but do not stimulate RLR signaling. We report that DVG70-114 facilitates the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes between iDVG and RIG-I, likely explaining its strong ability to trigger the antiviral response. Further studies using this powerful system may reveal currently unknown requirements for optimal RIG-I activation (45). In addition, we observed a role for DVG70-114 in enhancing the binding of MDA5 to DVG RNA, supporting our previous finding of a role for MDA5 in the early detection of SeV iDVGs (33).",

Facilitated binding to RLR by DVG70-114, together with the faster accumulation of DVGs over the standard virus genome in infected cells (24), likely explains the ability of iDVGs to overcome the viral antagonism of the immune response. We have identified a natural SeV iDVG molecular motif that facilitates the activation of the antiviral immune response by enhancing the binding of viral RNAs to the intracellular viral sensor protein RIG-I.

A pool of 32 oligonucleotides targeting the positive-sense SeV genome was designed as previously described (47). These probes recognize the positive-sense viral genome, as well as all virus-encoded mRNAs. For probes identifying DVGs, a pool of 15 single-stranded, 20-nt-long oligonucleotides specific for the 3\u2032 end of the positive-sense SeV genome (from position 14965 to position 15416) which covers the DVG sequences was designed by the same methods. These probes bind to DVGs, viral L protein mRNA, and the positive-sense SeV genome. In both pools, oligonucleotides were complementary to a different region of the target RNA, with no fewer than two bases separating any two oligonucleotides. SeV genome probes were labeled with Quasar 570, and DVG probes were labeled with Quasar 670 (Biosearch Technologies). Since L protein mRNA and the positive-sense SeV genome are recognized by both set of probes, pixels containing both colors were considered a SeV genome/protein representation. Pixels stained only with Quasar 670 (pseudocolored green) represent positive-sense DVGs. For combined FISH and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), cells were plated onto plain glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. RNA FISH was performed according to published protocols, with minor modifications (48). At different times after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-human IRF3 antibody (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz), followed by Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 40 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen). Stained cells were incubated in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min prior to FISH, washed with PBS, and then equilibrated in wash buffer containing 10% formamide and 2\u00d7 saline sodium citrate (SSC [1\u00d7 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate]). FISH was performed by hybridizing fixed cells with 10 nM probes diluted in hybridization buffer consisting of 10% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC, and 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate. Hybridization was performed overnight in a humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C. Imaging acquisition was performed with a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100\u00d7, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera.",
