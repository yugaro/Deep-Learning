The book is well laid out and organized with major parts for each of the Bacterial (Part 2), Viral (Part 3) and Parasitic (Part 4) infections. Each \u2018Part\u2019 contains several chapters, each of which is devoted to a specific infectious disease, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Chapter 21).",

This introductory section nicely sets the stage and provides the groundwork for all subsequent chapters. The book ends with special sections attributed to prions (Part 5), the immunocompromised and bioweapons (Part 6).",

Some of the subsequent subsections include: History, Causative Agent, Immune Response, Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention, and Surveillance, to name a few. Within these subsections, the author describes the disease, disease symptoms, mechanisms of infection and transmission, as well as the methods used for detection (e.g. CD4:CD8 T lymphocytes in HIV infection, p. 355) and prevention.",

Concepts are further emphasized with figures and tables that are interspersed throughout.",

The tables provide nice summaries of information that can be used as reference points (e.g. Table 11.1: Mechanism of Antibiotic Drug Action, p. 236). In addition to figures and tables, there are boxes of information for Recent Developments, which delve into more current research and technical details (e.g. vaccines for hepatitis C infection, p. 400). Although a direct citation for the information in the Recent Developments text boxes is not provided, a comprehensive list of references is provided at the end of each chapter. Much of the information is from reputable primary research articles, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and WHO (World Health Organization).",

In addition, as terms are mentioned throughout the text, they are bolded for emphasis. This makes it very easy and simple to follow from one concept to the next. The entire book is written in a very direct and succinct manner.",
