Although the incidence rate of pertussis has significantly decreased following the wide use of pertussis vaccine, B. pertussis infection is continuously occurring as a small outbreak even in several developed countries with high vaccination coverage (1-4). There has been the resurgence of reported pertussis cases primarily in infants younger than 1 yr old, especially less than 3 months of age, in adolescents and young adults worldwide (5, 6). The possible causes of increased incidence in adolescents and adults include waning of vaccine immunity, adaptation of circulating B. pertussis strains, development of diagnostic methods, and active surveillance due to increased awareness of pertussis (7-9). Household contact with infected adolescents and adults also becomes the major source of pertussis infection in infants who are not fully immunized, and this problematic circulation may consequently threaten overall public health (10, 11).",

National immunization program (NIP) of Korea consists of three primary series of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) at 2, 4, and 6 months, followed by a first booster at 15-18 months and a second booster between 4 and 6 yr of age. Recently, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccine in adolescents aged 11-12 yr is added to Korean NIP in 2012. The vaccination rate of primary DTaP continues to be approximately 94% (12, 13), and there is a mandatory notification system in Korea. An annual average of about 11.5 cases of pertussis has been reported to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), however, the reported cases of pertussis have increased since the 2000s. In addition, the KCDC reported that the incidence of pertussis was markedly increased (more than about 5.5 times) in 2009, compared to the previous (14). Also, the incidence of pertussis in 2011 was more than two times compared with the incidence in 2009 (15). We may predict the substantial outbreak in the future in our country.",

Three hospitals participated in the study: Seoul St. Mary's hospital; Suwon St. Vincent's hospital; and Incheon St. Mary's hospital. We evaluated all infants clinically suspected of pertussis infection because of a cough lasting at least 2 weeks with at least one of the following symptoms: paroxysmal coughing; inspiratory whooping; post-tussive vomiting or apnea without other known cause. We obtained information on current respiratory manifestations, radiologic findings and immunization status for each infant. Diagnostic approaches for pertussis were conducted for clinical cases. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), or swab samples if aspirates were not possible, and blood samples were collected within 2 days at admission. Laboratory tests were performed at the Vaccine Bio Institute (VBI) of The Catholic University of Korea. It is determined as the criteria for laboratory-confirmed pertussis case when the subjects is applicable to one of the following criteria: 1) positive result of B. pertussis on culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) or swab; this sample was collected and cultured on Regan-Lowe culture medium at 37\u2103 for more than 1 week; 2) positive result of B. pertussis in PCR or real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of NPA or swab; PCR was done by the method Glare et al. reported (16), and RT-PCR was done by modified method of Reischl U. Colleagues manual (17); 3) positive serology which defined as pertussis toxin (PT) antibody in a single serum sample that was higher than cut-off value (24 EU/mL) of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) or a 4-fold increased change in anti-PT antibody between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum.",

DTaP vaccination coverage in Korea is very high, with 94% of the children completing the primary series of pertussis immunization. Despite the nationwide vaccination program with high coverage, the incidence of reported pertussis has continued to increase from 2000. Understanding the epidemiological and clinical features of pertussis in community is important because it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we have made the demographic data from confirmed pertussis in an attempt to compare the clinical outcomes according to DTaP immunization. Generally, pertussis mostly occurred in young infants under 6 months of age who did not complete the primary series of DTaP vaccination. Depending on the immunization status of our patients, there were significant differences in clinical outcome similar to other studies (11, 19, 20). The duration of hospital stay was significantly longer; and the severe cases admitted to ICU were found in patients without pertussis vaccination as compared to those with vaccination. The absolute lymphocytosis in laboratory findings was shown primarily in patients without the vaccination history. The main presenting symptom in typical pertussis is whooping cough. Even though all patients had paroxysmal cough for more than 1 week, whooping cough was present in only 14.3% of the patients. In addition, most patients showed no specific findings in chest radiographs. Because the presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, it is important for clinicians to suspect pertussis when there is prolonged cough or absolute lymphocytosis, especially in young infants with no or incomplete DTaP vaccination.",

Few patients occurred in winter as other respiratory pathogens are commonly considered in the differential diagnosis. Similar studies from other countries have also shown that the reported pertussis case mostly occurred in a summer months with high temperatures (21, 22). Since the number of patients is too small, it is unclear to know the seasonality of pertussis based only upon this result. In addition, various factors such as environmental factors, school opening, and climate can affect the seasonal characteristics of pertussis epidemiology. However, because clinical presentations of pertussis often resemble influenza-like symptoms and those of other respiratory diseases such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, this lack of awareness and nonspecific clinical characteristics may be often associated with underdiagnosed condition of pertussis.",

The majority of confirmed cases were based in the presence of PCR. Although RT-PCR and serological test were not performed in all patients, these methods also have higher sensitivity than culture. Serologic testing can help the diagnosis of patients with atypical symptoms, for whom clinical samples are collected at later time from the onset of disease.",

However, none of them did know that pertussis might cause severe or chronic cough in adolescents and adults. Also, they did not have the concept of household transmission of pertussis. There has been an increase in the reported number of pertussiss cases in many countries, primarily among adolescents and adults, which is special concern because adolescents and young adults are a recognized reservoir of infection for neonates and infants, who are at high risk for pertussis-related morbidity and mortality (23-26). Several household studies have noted the predominant role of parents in the transmission of pertussis to susceptible infants (27, 28). For this reason, the USA Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended the cocooning strategy that Tdap vaccine be administered to all caregivers of infants less than 1 yr, in an effort to protect young infants against pertussis since 2006 (29). Likewise, the cocooning strategy is important in Korea, in keeping with high morbidity and mortality in young infants without immunization (30). Despite the introduction of Tdap vaccine in our country, vaccine use is only beginning, perhaps because of an incomplete understanding of the burden of pertussis among community population and the lack of national policy and education concerned with the necessity of Tdap vaccination. The immunization policy in Korea recently introduced the booster dose of Tdap vaccine as part of routine immunization in adolescent. Therefore, the change in the epidemiology of pertussis should be noted carefully.",

Most infants were too young to have received the primary series of DTaP vaccination before infection. Household members were identified as a potential source of pertussis infection, and they should be encouraged to receive booster immunization with Tdap to minimize pertussis transmission to this vulnerable group on infants. Nationwide pertussis reporting is also urgently required to better understand disease transmission patterns, for early recognition and prevention of outbreak and for the evaluation of vaccination policy. Universal recommendation for pertussis booster vaccination at 11 to 12 yr is expected to decrease the transmission of pertussis in households in Korea. The surveillance of pertussis outbreak should be continued for controlling this disease.",
