Although many guidelines or protocols have been proposed (7,8), there are few well-designed studies. Natural herbal medicine (NHM) has been used to control infectious diseases for thousands of years. In view of the possible beneficial effect of NHM on SARS or SARS-like infectious diseases, we conducted this randomized, double-blind clinical trial with placebo-control to examine its effectiveness.",

According to Treatise on Febrile Disease (Shang Han Lun), a variety of herbal formulas have been employed to treat patients with infectious diseases for over 1800 years. When the outbreak began in Guandong, NHM had already been anecdotally used as a supplementary regimen. Therefore, we had conceived the trial strategy before the SARS outbreak that occurred at the end of April in several hospitals in Taiwan. NHM is generally well accepted among the Chinese population; 95% of our patients agreed to participate in our study. In fact, many anecdotal reports have been proposed on the use of NHM for SARS patients, unfortunately none was a controlled trial (20).",

This study was designed only to detect changes in IRS and DI. Nevertheless, our literature review offers significant insight worthy of further exploration on SARS. Avendano and Booth reported that many SARS cases in Toronto presented with hypocalcemia within 3 days of admission (6,14). We checked serum calcium in one of our cases, which showed hypocalcemia on the fourth day after the onset of disease (the second day of admission). The major ingredient of our NHM A is a mineral, Gypsum fibrosum (16 gm, 13.3% of recipe by weight), which contains mainly calcium sulfate, popularly used for antipyretic and clearing the accumulated heat in the lung according to the traditional Chinese medical theory. We speculate that one of the effective mechanisms of NHM A is associated with correction of electrolyte imbalance that may play a very important role in enhancing immunity. Some natural products have been found to inhibit SARS-CoV 3C-like protease activity (28). The mechanism of anti-SARS effect in natural products merits further investigation.",
