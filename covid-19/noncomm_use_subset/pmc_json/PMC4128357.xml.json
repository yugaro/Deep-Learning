However, virus-host interactions that allow for CoV adaptation and survival are not well understood. CoVs are a family of enveloped RNA viruses with large positive-strand genomes of 26 to 32 kb (5). The CoV life cycle is initiated by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to a cellular receptor, followed by entry by direct fusion at the plasma membrane or by endosomal uptake (6). CoV replicase proteins extensively modify intracellular membranes to form sites of viral RNA synthesis, followed by virus assembly and maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), with release by nonlytic secretory mechanisms (5, 7, 8).",

            "text": "For several CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS CoV, cell surface expression of spike protein mediates interactions with receptors on adjacent cells, resulting in cell fusion and syncytium formation. Syncytium formation is a well-described cytopathic effect for many viruses in cell culture or in animal model systems and has been suggested to increase viral cell-to-cell spreading (9). However, for CoVs, syncytium formation has not been tested for a role in replication or cell-to-cell spreading. In this study, we demonstrate that CoVs induce plasma membrane changes consistent with macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a type of endocytosis that is morphologically defined by the presence of membranous extensions of outwardly polymerizing actin termed membrane ruffles. Membrane ruffles nonspecifically surround and internalize fluid cargo into large vesicles or macropinosomes (10\u201312). Membrane ruffling is involved in cell migration, cell-cell interactions, environmental sampling, recycling of surface proteins and membranes, and delivery of bulk material to endosomes and lysosomes (13\u201316). Macropinocytosis can be transient, such as during the clearance of apoptotic bodies, or constitutive, like that associated with immune cells monitoring the environment for pathogens (17) or in cells transformed by the SRC oncogene (18). Macropinocytosis may be initiated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and involves signaling though GTPases and kinases, including Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1. Further, macropinocytosis requires sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHE) and thus is specifically inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) (19, 20). Macropinocytosis has been identified as an entry mechanism for several pathogens, including Salmonella enterica, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, coxsackie B virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus, vaccinia virus, Nipah virus, and HIV (19, 21). In each of these studies, membrane ruffling or blebbing is induced by addition of the pathogen to a cell culture, and membrane modifications cease after pathogen internalization. To date, no role for macropinocytosis other than entry has been described as a host-pathogen interaction of viruses or bacteria.",

We demonstrate that MHV-induced macropinocytosis is continuous once initiated \u22654 h postinfection (hpi), significantly after viral entry is completed. Replicating virus is required for induction of macropinocytosis, and inhibition of macropinocytosis impairs viral titers and cell-cell fusion. MHV-induced macropinocytosis requires fusogenic spike glycoprotein and is dependent on EGFR activation. The results support a role for CoV-induced macropinocytosis in cell fusion and virus cell-to-cell spreading, representing novel exploitation of macropinocytosis machinery for virus use.",

            "text": "During live-cell imaging of MHV-infected cells, we observed that MHV-infected cells displayed plasma membrane ruffling and extensive filopodia. We therefore examined the etiology and role of plasma membrane ruffling during CoV infection. Murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma cells were infected with MHV strain A59 (MHV A59) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a fusion with the replicase protein nsp3 (22), and cells were imaged continuously from 4 to 12 hpi, until the monolayer was entirely involved in syncytia or was lost (Fig. 1A; see Movie S1A\nto\nC in the supplemental material). Cell infection was confirmed both by the presence of GFP-nsp3 at replication complexes and by syncytium formation, a characteristic cytopathic effect of MHV infection. Membrane ruffling on multiple edges of the cell was noted to begin after 5 hpi, similar to the time of appearance of GFP-nsp3 fusion proteins at replication complexes, and was continuous throughout infection. The plasma membrane changes were extensive and included lamellipodia, filopodia, peripheral dorsal ruffles, and circular dorsal ruffles (Fig. 1A; see Movie S1A\nto\nC). The membrane ruffling associated with infection frequently resulted in the internalization of large vesicles. We measured the diameters of 386 vesicles in five live-imaging movies of MHV-infected cell monolayers. Vesicle diameters ranged from 0.49 to 4.14 \u00b5m with a mean diameter of 1.45 \u00b5m (Fig. 1B). This large vesicle diameter was similar to that reported for macropinosomes in multiple systems and much larger and more variable in size than that of endosomes generated by other forms of endocytosis (23). In addition to ruffling and vesicle formation, MHV-infected cells reproducibly manifested long filopodia that extended from infected cells and contacted distant cells, resulting in fusion at the point of contact and subsequent recruitment of cells into syncytia (see Movie S2A\nto\nC in the supplemental material).",

To test whether CoV-infected cells were inducing bulk fluid uptake, we used Nile Red neutral polystyrene nanoparticles with a diameter of 800 nm as markers, since their size is excluded from all endocytic pathways except macropinocytosis. MHV-infected DBT cells (Fig. 2A and B) and SARS CoV-infected DBT-hACE2 cells (Fig. 2B) were incubated with nanoparticles during the last 3 h of infection. Cell monolayers infected with either MHV or SARS CoV demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of cells with internalized nanoparticles than mock-infected cells (Fig. 2B). Macropinocytosis has been described as a means of pathogen entry in several different systems. However, since our data suggested that MHV-induced ruffling was occurring much later during infection, we next sought to determine the timing of bulk fluid uptake during MHV infection. Cells were mock infected or infected with MHV and then incubated with nanoparticles for 2-h intervals beginning at infection and fixed immediately afterward (Fig. 2C). Significantly increased nanoparticle uptake was first detected between 4 and 6 hpi and was also prominent at 6 to 8 hpi, indicating that increased fluid-phase uptake initiates at 4 h or later postentry and continues through the remainder of infection. This result was consistent with our visual and quantitative measurements of ruffling and vesicle formation. Because nanoparticle uptake occurred late during infection, we next tested whether replicating MHV is required to induce bulk fluid uptake. Cells were mock infected, infected with MHV, or incubated with an equal concentration of UV-inactivated or heat-inactivated MHV and incubated with nanoparticles for 2-h intervals, beginning at infection (Fig. 2C). UV-inactivated MHV did not result in increased nanoparticle uptake, suggesting that surface receptor interactions were insufficient to induce macropinocytosis. Heat-inactivated MHV also did not cause nanoparticle internalization, suggesting that the membrane-ruffling phenotype observed was not a cellular response to foreign particles. In addition, in order to confirm that macropinocytosis is not utilized for entry of CoVs, we labeled virions with 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and added them to DBT cells grown on a glass bottom dish at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 PFU/cell (Fig. 2D). Virions were adsorbed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to synchronize the infection before they were transferred to the 37\u00b0C chamber incubator surrounding the microscope. Cells were then live imaged for 1 h. While we did visualize viruses entering cells at the plasma membrane, we did not observe any evidence of cellular membrane ruffling at the site of entry or elsewhere on the cell. Thus, virus infection is required for induction of bulk fluid uptake, and MHV-induced macropinocytosis is not associated with virus entry.",

We utilized siRNA knockdown of Pak1, treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin A (CdtA), or treatment with EIPA and determined the effect on viral replication. CdtA decreases the ADP-ribosylation of Rho family proteins, and thus, we used this as an independent mechanism to confirm the relationship between macropinocytosis and viral replication (26). Inhibition of Pak1 with siRNA prior to infection caused a \u226580% decrease in MHV titers at 12 hpi, while the use of a scrambled siRNA or an siRNA against RhoA did not have a significant effect on titers (Fig. 4A). Treatment with CdtA also caused a significant decrease in MHV titers at 10 hpi (Fig. 4B and C). EIPA was added to MHV-infected cell monolayers at different concentrations and times postinfection (Fig. 4D and E). EIPA treatment resulted in a \u226575% decrease in virus titers when added at any time after 2 hpi. To test the effect of EIPA on different stages of the virus life cycle, we infected cells with MHV expressing firefly luciferase (FFL) as a fusion with the replicase protein nsp2 (22) and measured FFL activity in the presence or absence of EIPA added at 8 hpi (Fig. 4F). In replicate experiments, supernatant was collected at 10 hpi and cell-associated virus was collected by freezing and thawing infected cells three times. The titer of each sample was assessed by plaque assay (Fig. 4G). Intracellular FFL-nsp2 expression from the viral genome was not altered by EIPA treatment. In addition, the viral titer was significantly decreased in the supernatant of cells treated with EIPA, while the intracellular virus titer was not affected by the addition of EIPA. Together, these results indicate that EIPA does not affect intracellular virus replication, assembly, or maturation but alters the overall peak titer of the infectious virus in the supernatant, consistent with an effect on late stages of virus release or cell-to-cell spreading.",

In MHV A59, the spike protein is cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi network during virion maturation (27), resulting in fusogenic spike protein on nascent virions and on the plasma membrane of infected cells. Interaction of the MHV A59 spike protein with the cellular receptor results in either virus-cell fusion and cell entry or cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation (27). In contrast, the spike protein of another strain, MHV-2, is not cleaved by furin during the exit of nascent virions but rather is cleaved by cathepsins following endocytosis during entry (28). Thus, released infectious MHV-2 does not have a fusogenic spike protein, and cells infected with MHV-2 do not express a fusogenic spike protein on the cell surface or generate syncytia in culture.",

MHV 2S-infected cells internalized significantly fewer nanoparticles than MHV A59-infected cells (Fig. 5A). To test the specific requirement for spike protein cleavage, we infected cells with an MHV A59 C12 mutant containing an amino acid mutation (H716D) that abolishes the furin cleavage site (30). During infection with MHV C12, there was no significant difference in nanoparticle internalization from that in mock-infected cells (Fig. 5A). We next used a furin inhibitor, peptidyl chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) (27) to block furin cleavage of the MHV A59 spike protein. Treatment with dec-RVKR-cmk decreased both nanoparticle uptake and syncytium formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B to D). To test whether spike protein cleavage alone is sufficient to induce macropinocytosis, we treated cells infected with MHV 2S with L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin in order to generate fusogenic spike protein on the cell surface and assessed nanoparticle uptake. Cells infected with MHV 2S and treated with trypsin recovered the capacity for nanoparticle internalization (Fig. 5E). Together, these results demonstrate that expression of fusion-competent spike protein at the plasma membrane is necessary for MHV macropinocytosis induction.",

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used two approaches: induction of syncytia by different methods and blockade of syncytium formation with antireceptor antibodies. To test the cell fusion hypothesis, cells were chemically treated with polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG-1500) or transfected with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (Fig. 6A) to induce cell-cell fusion and then incubated with nanoparticles. Both PEG-1500 treatment and VSV-G expression resulted in small syncytia with fewer than 10 nuclei. The nanoparticle uptake levels of syncytia with similar numbers of nuclei from MHV-infected cells, PEG-1500-treated cells, and VSV-G-transfected cells were compared. PEG-1500 treatment resulted in nanoparticle uptake greater than that of mock-infected cells but significantly less than that seen during MHV infection. Expression of VSV-G did not result in greater nanoparticle uptake than in mock-infected cells. We next blocked the interactions of MHV A59 spike protein with its cellular receptor, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM), by adding anti-CEACAM blocking antibodies at 2 hpi and measured the effect on syncytium size and nanoparticle uptake (Fig. 6B). The anti-CEACAM antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in syncytial cell number and size but did not significantly decrease nanoparticle uptake by infected cells (Fig. 6C). Together, these results demonstrate that cleaved spike protein at the cell surface, and not cell fusion alone, is required to initiate and sustain macropinocytosis.",

To test whether EGFR activation is required for CoV-induced macropinocytosis, we utilized gefitinib, which specifically inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation and prevents EGFR activation (34). DBT cells were mock infected or infected with MHV A59, gefitinib was added after viral entry at 1.5 hpi, and cells were analyzed for nanoparticle uptake and syncytium size (Fig. 7A to C). Addition of gefitinib to MHV-infected cells significantly decreased the percentage of syncytia with internalized nanoparticles (Fig. 7B). We also observed that gefitinib significantly decreased the number of nuclei in a syncytium, with only half as many nuclei as in a DMSO-treated syncytium (Fig. 7C). We then evaluated the effect of EIPA on syncytium size and discovered that treatment with EIPA decreased both the percentage of infected cells involved in syncytia (Fig. 7D) and the size of the syncytia (Fig. 7E). These data suggest that CoVs utilize EGFR activation to induce macropinocytosis and to initiate cell-to-cell spreading.",

Here, we report that CoVs also have the capacity to modify the plasma membrane through activation of the macropinocytosis pathway. Prior to this study, the only role demonstrated for virus-induced macropinocytosis was in virus entry. MHV-associated macropinocytosis, in contrast, is initiated relatively late during infection and is continuous once activated. MHV 2S does not stimulate cell-cell fusion or macropinocytosis in infected cells but still causes disease in vivo, suggesting that macropinocytosis may not be required for the fitness or pathogenesis of all strains of MHV or for all CoVs. The disease phenotypes of MHV A59 and 2S differ, as infection with MHV A59, but not MHV 2S, causes spinal cord demyelination (35), suggesting that macropinocytosis-driven cell-to-cell spreading could be a tissue-specific strategy. The conservation of macropinocytosis during MHV and SARS CoV infections, however, suggests that macropinocytosis induction could be an important determinant of pathogenesis for viruses capable of maintaining cleaved spike protein on the surface of infected cells.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate two consistent and dramatic phenotypes associated with MHV-induced macropinocytosis: ruffling with vesicle internalization and filopodia associated with cell fusion and recruitment into syncytia. The fact that inhibition of MHV-induced macropinocytosis impairs the overall virus titer while not affecting entry or intracellular infectious virus suggests the possibility of multiple functions that favor overall virus fitness, specifically, recruitment of membranes and nutrients into infected cells and syncytia, enhancement of virus release, or virus cell-to-cell spreading. MHV A59 acquires its viral envelope by budding through the ERGIC and is released from the cell without lysis via the exocytic pathway. No previous role for a traditionally endocytic pathway such as macropinocytosis has been reported to be used during viral release (36, 37). The observed increase in the formation of long filopodia from infected cells that contact and recruit uninfected cells into syncytia suggests a role for macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which CoVs potentiate cell communication over significant distances. Filopodia could act as mediators of CoV cell-cell fusion by concentrating spike protein and virus at the filopodium tip. Actin modifications have been previously implicated in the cell-to-cell spreading of other viruses. Vaccinia virus utilizes actin tails to infect distant cells at a rate faster than that at which it infects adjacent cells (38, 39). HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus use filopodia to create virological synapses to transfer infectious material from one cell to another (40, 41). Macropinocytosis can occur in polarized cells (42) and could represent a novel mechanism of virus cell-to-cell spreading over tight junctions within airway epithelium. Viral spreading in this manner has several advantages over viral spreading via exocytosis, specifically, immune evasion, concentration of reagents, speed, and the capacity to circumvent physical barriers. Increasing the size and duration of plasma membrane extensions could increase opportunities for interactions with adjacent or distant cells.",

Spike protein is cleaved to its fusogenic form by cathepsins after entry via endocytosis, and the virus fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the genome to the cytoplasm. Replication occurs, and virions are assembled in the ERGIC and then packaged and released via exocytosis. Spike protein that reaches the surface of the cell is uncleaved (black ball and stick) and cannot mediate syncytium formation with neighboring cells. MHV A59 enters the cell via fusion at the cell membrane after the spike protein interacts with the CEACAM receptor. The genome immediately enters the cytoplasm, and replication occurs. Packaging of nascent virions occurs in the ERGIC, and free spike proteins and spike protein incorporated into virions are cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi compartment. Virions are packaged and released via exocytosis. Spike protein that reaches the cell surface is cleaved and fusogenically active (red ball and stick) and can mediate fusion events with neighboring cells. This cleaved, activated spike protein can also mediate interactions, potentially through the EGFR (purple ball and stick), that induce the macropinocytosis pathway within the cell, which relies on Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1. Actin modifications at the cell surface then cause membrane ruffling and macropinosome internalization, in addition to filopodia that can facilitate spike protein-receptor interactions with neighboring cells.
