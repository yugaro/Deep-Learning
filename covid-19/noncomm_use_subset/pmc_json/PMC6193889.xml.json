Matsubara et al.19 demonstrated that 22.7% of MRMP cases showed clinical improvement within 3 days after macrolide treatment. In addition, Suzuki et al.17 reported that fever resolved with the initially prescribed macrolide, without changing antibiotics, for the treatment of MRMP infection, and there was no apparent treatment failure or cases of serious illness. It was suggested that macrolides have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as antimicrobial effects, through the inhibition of the production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells.2930 In our data, there were no cases of treatment failure in the PMC group, except for two cases of re-hospitalization.

            "text": "Recently, several studies suggested that tetracycline and fluoroquinolone had a therapeutic effect on MRMP in children. Most patients administered DXC or minocycline achieved defervescence within 24 hours, with a significantly shorter TTD than macrolide in the MRMP group (13.5 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 123.3 \u00b1 59.0 hours).2135 Miyashita et al.36 reported that 77% of patients with MRMP in the quinolone group achieved defervescence within 48 hours after the initiation of antibiotics and quinolone was more effective than macrolide for MRMP treatment (P = 0.036). In this study, TTD after DXC and LFX treatment was 27.4 \u00b1 33.2 hours and 16.8 \u00b1 18.0 hours, respectively. In addition, 85.7% and 83.3% of patients achieved defervescence within 48 hours in the DXC and LFX groups, respectively (Table 2). Direct comparison of TTD between the PMC group and the secondary treatment groups was not possible, because all patients were initially treated with macrolide and added on or switched to CST, DXC, and LFX. Therefore, we performed PS matching to adjust differences in baseline characteristics among the groups and compared TTD after initial macrolide treatment between groups. However, the TTDs after initial macrolide treatment of the CST, DXC, LFX groups did not differ from that of each matched PMC group (P = 0.085, P = 0.453, and P = 0.283, respectively). There was no difference in length of hospital stay between the PMC group and the secondary treatment groups (Table 3).",

In addition, the risk of cartilage injury with LFX was clinically undetectable in children over 5 years old, or was easily reversible.24 Of the 1,340 subjects treated with LFX, only one case (0.07%) was \u2018possibly related\u2019 to drug therapy assessed at 5 years, and this was not different from the comparator group (1/893, 0.1%). However, because concerns about the safety of tetracycline and fluoroquinolone in children still exist, it should be cautiously used with the consideration of both the risk and benefit in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia.",

Firstly, as this study was performed retrospectively, the clinical information might be uncertain, especially with regard to the use and duration of macrolide prescribed in other clinics. Secondly, the numbers of patients in DXC and LFX groups were small. In the future, it is necessary to carry out prospective randomized studies or to conduct studies involving more subjects through multicenter studies. Lastly, the IgM antibody test was used to diagnose MP infection. Although the patients with a history of MP infection within past year were excluded, some subjects with false positive could be included due to prolonged existence of IgM for several months after past infection. In addition, false negatives could also exist due to a lack of IgM antibodies in early stages. However, other alternative methods, such as isolation or the molecular detection of MP, cannot differentiate asymptomatic carriage of MP in the nasopharynx from infection or MP pneumonia.",
