            "text": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic syndrome caused by insulin deficiency and resistance. There are 200 million diabetic individuals in the world, with only approximately one-half being diagnosed, and these numbers are expected to double by 2030. The disease often results in long-term microvascular, neurological, and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Excessive activation of angiotensin II (AngII) is an important underlying mechanism for the development of diabetes, and Ang (1-7) is hypothesized to counteract it. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is significantly involved in the development of diabetes and its complications. The activation of RAS causes pancreatic \u03b2 cell dysfunction by suppressing pro-insulin biosynthesis, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and first phase insulin secretion (1\u20132), as well as by increasing islet fibrosis (3) and oxidative stress (4). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)]-Mas axis is suggested to have an antagonistic effect on the RAS, while Ang (1-7) is the main antagonist of AngII. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) can alleviate these pathological changes (3,5\u20137). Also, several clinical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAS blockade in reducing the onset of diabetes (8\u201311).",

            "text": "In 2006, it was demonstrated that patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were more inclined to exhibit higher blood glucose (12), and this may be partly due to the fact that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (13). Thus we hypothesized that the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis has a protective effect on pancreatic \u03b2 cell function. Our previous study demonstrated for the first time that loss of ACE2 led to impaired glucose homeostasis in mice. In addition, ACE2 knockout (ACE2-/y) mice exhibit progressive impairments in glucose tolerance and reduced first-phase insulin secretion (14). The present study aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects. Accordingly, ACE2 gene therapy improved glycemic control in diabetic mice via Ang (1-7) (15). Ang (1-7) is hypothesized to exhibit antioxidant effects in diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and in the brain (16\u201319). These data confirm the protective role of the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis in the pancreas and establish a novel target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Bindom et al (15) found that ACE2 overexpression in the pancreas of diabetic rats improves the function of \u03b2 cells. Furthermore, the protective effect can be blocked by its specific inhibitor A779, which suggested that this effect was mediated by Ang (1-7) (15) and is consistent with the findings of the present study. In addition, chronic injection of Ang (1-7) improves insulin sensitivity in rats with a high-fructose diet (24), Mas receptor knockout mice exhibited decreased insulin sensitivity, impaired glucose tolerance and glucose uptake (25). These studies demonstrated the protective role of Ang (1-7) in the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In addition, a number of studies in other systems supported the idea that the protective role of Ang (1-7) occurs by reducing oxidative stress. ACE2 overexpression results in a reduction of ROS formation in the brain (17).

GSCa results can be obtained rapidly and at a lower cost than GSIS (27). In addition, the calcium curve directly reflects the changes in insulin secretion within the first 15 min following the addition of glucose. In the present study, it was observed that the intracellular calcium fluorescence intensity and the amplitude of insulin secretion in the first phase significantly decreased following treatment with H2O2. This result is consistent with the insulin secretion experiment, which suggests that the reduction of insulin secretion is correlated with a decrease in intracellular calcium. Ang (1-7) can restore the calcium fluorescent intensity and the signaling peak of first phase insulin secretion. Moreover, A779 can block this effect. This study confirmed that oxidative stress can cause a decline in intracellular calcium, which results in the reduction of first phase insulin secretion in pancreatic cells, and Ang-(1-7) can restore this early \u03b2 cell dysfunction associated with calcium levels. Our previous study showed that ACE2 knockout mice exhibited progressive impairments in glucose tolerance and reduced first-phase insulin secretion (14); thus, in vivo and in vitro experiments were consistent. These results demonstrated the importance of the ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis in the early stages of diabetes and its protective role in the early treatment of diabetes, as well as the correlation with Ang (1-7) and oxidative stress in INS-1 cells.",

MMP was evaluated by laser confocal microscopy. Ang (1-7) decreased the green fluorescence (column 1) and increased the red fluorescence (column 2) when compared with the Con + H2O2 groups. Ang (1-7) restores MMP in the presence of H2O2. The staining was quantified and presented as a graph. Ang (1-7) treatment reversed the decreases in the MMP induced by H2O2 (15 min at 250 \u00b5M H2O2), and this effect was blocked by A779. *P<0.05 and ***P<0.001. Data are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (n=3). MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; Con, control.",
