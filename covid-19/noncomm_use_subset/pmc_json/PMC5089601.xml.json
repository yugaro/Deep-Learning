In a first step, univariate analyses (Mann\u2013Whitney and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests) were performed to evaluate a possible association of each factor on either fecal marker. Variables examined included age of puppies (5\u20136/7\u20138/9\u201311 weeks of age), breed size (small/large), fecal quality (normal/abnormal), G. inestinalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, Toxocara canis, CPV2, and CCV shedding (yes/no), shedding of \u22651virus (yes/no), shedding of \u22651parasite (yes/no), and shedding of \u22651 enteropathogen (yes/no). In a second step, relationships between shedding of enteropathogens and fecal marker concentrations were evaluated in 3 different linear mixed models for each marker. In a first linear mixed model, effects of each pathogen (shedding of each pathogen [yes/no]) on either marker were evaluated. In a second linear mixed model, influence of the type of enteropathogens (shedding of \u22651 parasite [yes/no] and shedding of \u22651 virus [yes/no]) on either fecal marker was evaluated. In a last linear mixed model, global effect of enteropathogens (shedding of \u22651 enteropathogen [yes/no]) on both fecal markers was evaluated. In all of these mixed models, breed size and age of puppies were included as fixed effects and litter variable nested within breeding kennel was defined as a random term. For each model, the normality of residuals distribution was assessed using the Shapiro\u2010Wilk test. According to residuals distribution for each of the multivariable models, the outcome was log transformed (fecal calprotectin concentration) or rank transformed (fecal IgA concentration). Differences were considered significant for P values <.05. Quantitative data are presented as medians with ranges.",

Thus, noninvasive markers of digestive health, the concentrations of which might be modified by the presence of enteropathogens, would be of great utility in these patients. Thus, our study investigated 2 fecal markers, calprotectin and IgA, used in human pediatric gastroenterology for their utility in weanling puppies. In our study, puppies that shed \u22651 enteropathogen had significantly lower fecal IgA concentrations than did puppies without any enteropathogen shedding identified. This lower fecal IgA concentration may be a cause or a consequence of the enteropathogen shedding. Immunoglobulin A can actively bind microrganisms, enterotoxins, and other antigens, and prevent adherence and subsequent penetration of the intestinal wall. Thus, a lower fecal IgA concentration could be caused by IgA being utilized in antigen binding or by enterohepatic recirculation of IgA. After IgA binds an antigen in the intestinal lumen, it is either excreted in the feces or is actively reabsorbed for destruction of the microorganism or virus by hepatic Kuppfer cells. Reabsorption of IgA could have been increased by an infection with an enteropathogen, which could result in decreased fecal concentrations of IgA. Conversely, the lower fecal IgA concentration also could indicate the presence of altered local immunity and thus serve as evidence for a higher risk of infection with an enteropathogen. A positive impact of fecal IgA on protection against infectious diseases already has been described in other species. Mice lacking secretory IgA exhibit a significant delay in clearance of rotavirus infection compared with mice that have secretory IgA.44 In children, fecal IgA concentrations also were shown to have an influence on protection against rotavirus infection and resulting disease.45\n",

This lack of difference in calprotectin concentrations between dogs that showed enteropathogen shedding and those that did not could be explained by the population of dogs enrolled in our study (ie, healthy puppies or puppies presenting only with an abnormal fecal quality without any other clinical sign). In humans, the patient's clinical status influences the concentrations of this marker. In children who are clinically healthy but infected by Giardia, no effect on fecal calprotectin concentration was described.33 However, in human patients with viral gastroenteritis, fecal calprotectin concentrations were reported to be associated with the severity of clinical signs.46 In our study, 18.9% of puppies were found to be excreting a high load of CPV2 but without any of the typical clinical signs (eg, hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, prostration, dehydration, anorexia). This healthy carrier state could explain the lack of association between shedding of this virus and fecal calprotectin concentrations. Another study comparing fecal calprotectin concentrations among healthy puppies, puppies with an abnormal fecal quality, and puppies with clinical parvovirus infection would be needed to further elucidate this relationship.",

The higher IgA and calprotectin concentrations in puppies with liquid or soft feces in this study do not seem to be a direct consequence of stool consistency (dilution) because this negative correlation was observed for fresh feces as well as for concentrations based on fecal dry matter. The negative correlation between fecal score and fecal marker concentration could be explained by the effect of age acting as a confounding factor. Indeed age influence feces quality (lower fecal score in very young puppies)6 and, at the same time, age influences fecal concentrations of both markers (higher fecal concentrations in very young puppies).47\n",

This result is in accordance with our longitudinal study performed in young dogs around the age of weaning.47 In humans, considerably higher fecal calprotectin concentrations also have been observed in infants around the time of birth compared with those in healthy older children and adults.33, 48, 49, 50 In our study, 17% of puppies had high fecal calprotectin concentrations (>49 \u03bcg/g) similar to those observed in adult dogs with inflammatory bowel disease, with large interindividual variations.19 These high concentrations do not appear to be linked to viral or parasite shedding because this effect of age on fecal calprotectin concentrations was still observed when both variables (age and enteropathogen shedding) were taken into consideration within the same statistical model. Moreover, we previously observed a spontaneous normalization of fecal calprotectin concentrations in healthy puppies during the weaning period.47 The type of food (eg, natural milk, industrial milk, dry food) may have influenced fecal calprotectin concentrations. Human infants who are exclusively breastfed show significantly higher fecal calprotectin concentrations compared to those receiving a mixed diet.49, 51 The effect of natural milk may depend on several factors such as hormones (eg, ghrelin, leptin), cytokines and other immunostimulants and growth factors (eg, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor), which all contribute to the development of the gastrointestinal immune system.51 Milk ingestion was not controlled in our study, with puppies having free access to maternal milk. However, from 5 to 8 weeks of age, the proportion of natural maternal milk decreases continuously in a puppie's diet because of physiologic progressive weaning. Developmental processes occurring in the digestive tract during this period of life also could explain the higher fecal calprotectin concentrations. During the first weeks of life, intestinal permeability is higher52, which may lead to transepithelial migration of neutrophils, as observed in adults with inflammatory bowel disease.53 The physiological establishment and stabilization of the gut microbiota also may have an effect on calprotectin release as has been suggested in humans.54, 55 The higher calprotectin concentrations observed also could be linked to bacterial gastrointestinal infections as described in children.15, 56\n",

The development of noninvasive fecal biomarkers that may prove to be useful to evaluate gastrointestinal health in puppies remains a challenge.",
