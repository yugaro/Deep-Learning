The detection rate of HBoV infection was at its peak in the first year of life (rate of detection, 8.6% between the ages of 6 and 12 months), as in the cases of RSV or PIV infection. Most of the HBoV-positive patients aged less than 3 yr belonged to the high-viral-load group. The detection rate was lower (1.5%) in patients aged more than 10 yr, and these patients belonged exclusively to the low-viral-load group. HBoV is rarely detected in adults except in cases of immunosuppression [10, 16, 17]. The lower detection rate and viral load of HBoV in older patients may be attributed to immunity acquired from an infection at a younger age. A seroepidemiologic study of HBoV showed that 5.6-83.3% of children aged 6 months-3 yr were seropositive for HBoV [18]. Lau et al. [19] suggested that HBoV infection might develop only once because of the subsequent development of life-long immunity conferred by neutralizing antibodies produced in response to the infection.",

            "text": "The frequency of HBoV codetection with other respiratory viruses was 18.3% in the HBoV-positive samples and was lower than the previously published data [4, 20]. This difference in the codetection frequency is attributed to the different detection methods; molecular diagnostic methods were used for the detection of other respiratory viruses in the other studies whereas we used virus culturing. Among the 17 HBoV-positive patients who were also positive for infection with other viruses, 10 showed PIV infection. The high association of HBoV with PIV seems to be attributed to the high prevalence of PIV infection in 2006 (22.8% in May). Interestingly, almost all cases (except two) positive for both HBoV and another respiratory virus belonged to the low-viral-load group. As the virus culture was used for the detection of major respiratory viruses, the isolated virus could be the main causative agent of respiratory illness. Therefore, the presence of low copy number of HBoV, detected by molecular method, may indicate prolonged viral shedding or an asymptomatic infection. Recently, prolonged presence of HBoV in NPAs has been reported [21]. These results suggest that single HBoV infection in the high-viral-load group may play an active role in respiratory infection. These findings are consistent with a Norwegian study that reported detection of HBoV alone and a high-viral-load were associated with respiratory tract infection [20]. In that study, patients with a high-viral-load in NPAs developed viremia more frequently than the patients with a moderate-or a low-viral-load did. In our study, HBoV-positive patients in the high-viral-load group showed significantly higher pulse rates and respiratory rates than the in the low-viral-load group. These findings also support the idea that a high-viral-load may be associated with a respiratory infection.",
