The natural host of influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds, with 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes identified in avian species 1. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) of the H9N2 subtype circulate primarily among wild birds and domestic poultry, but the viruses can infect swine and humans as well. A total of 42 cases of non\u2010fatal human infection were reported in Asia and the Middle East as of March 2018 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.",

H9N2 viruses are divided into a North American lineage and a Eurasian lineage 11. The North American lineage H9N2 viruses are typically detected in shorebirds and wild ducks, and no cases of human infection have been reported to date 12. The Eurasian lineage of H9N2 AIV circulating in Asia, the Middle East and Europe have been classified into two major lineages, Y280 and G1, and one minor Korean lineage. Since 1997, sporadic laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of avian\u2010to\u2010human transmission of Y280\u2010lineage viruses in China and G1\u2010lineage viruses in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh and Egypt have been reported (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. However, the results of serologic studies in Asia and the Middle East suggest that the number of humans infected by H9N2 AIV is much greater than the number of laboratory\u2010confirmed cases 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. It is thus important to monitor H9N2 AIV in wild birds and poultry in order to assess the risk for human infection.",

In particular, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (rRT\u2010PCR) is one of the most widely used methods for detecting viral genes, and rRT\u2010PCR assays for detecting H9 viruses have been reported 19, 20, 21, 22. However, the sequences of probes and primers used in rRT\u2010PCR in previous studies were designed for detecting viruses of the North American lineage or past circulated G1\u2010lineage H9 AIV. These methods did not use minor groove binder (MGB) probes, resulting in different conditions for these assays compared with the assay used in Japan for detecting other influenza viruses. Therefore, our newly developed, one\u2010step rRT\u2010PCR assay was designed to detect both recent Y280\u2010 and G1\u2010lineage H9 AIV, including those causing human infection.",

The AIV of 11 belonged to Y280, five AIV belonged to G1, four AIV belonged to the Korean lineage and one AIV belonged to the North American lineage; all were detected by the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay (Table 2). Phylogenetically, H9N2 viruses isolated from smuggled meats illegally imported into Japan, including A/duck/Japan/AQ\u2010HE5/2015 (H9N2), A/chicken/Japan/AQ\u2010HE14/2015 (H9N2), A/duck/Japan/AQ\u2010HE28/2015 (H9N2), A/chicken/Japan/AQ\u2010HE61/2015 (H9N2), A/chicken/Japan/AQ\u2010HE28\u201028/2016 (H9N2), A/chicken/Japan/AQ\u2010HE28\u201050/2016 (H9N2) and A/chicken/Japan/AQ\u2010HE28\u201057/2016 (H9N2), were classified into the Y280 lineage along with closely related AIV recently isolated from poultry in China (Figure 1). All RNA extracted from the AIV (except for A/duck/Hokkaido/31/97 [H9N2], belonging to the Korean lineage, and A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 [H9N2], belonging to the North American lineage) and both G1\u2010 and one of the Y280\u2010lineage virus in vitro\u2010transcribed H9 HA RNA could be detected at concentrations corresponding to 5, 50 and 500 copies of the M gene RNA per reaction and 5, 50 and 500 copies of H9 HA gene per reaction using the newly established H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay (Table 2 and data not shown). For these AIV, the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay exhibited amplification plots similar to the type A rRT\u2010PCR assay (Figure S2a). A/duck/Hokkaido/31/97 (Korean lineage) and A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (North American lineage), which were isolated over 20 years ago, could also be detected using the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay at RNA concentrations corresponding to a minimum of 500 and 50 copies/reaction of M gene RNA in viral extracted RNA, respectively (Table 2). However, both viruses could be detected at 5, 50 and 500 copies of M gene RNA per reaction using the type A rRT\u2010PCR assay, suggesting that the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay is less sensitive against these past prevalent viruses (Figure S2b).",

            "text": "Among H9N2 viruses, those of the Y280 lineage are spreading primarily in poultry in China, and this has resulted in occasional cases of human infection. H9N2 viruses of the G1 lineage are more prevalent in poultry in Asia and the Middle East, with recent reports of sporadic transmission to humans in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh and Egypt. We therefore developed a new H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay that is highly sensitive and specific for viruses of the Y280 and G1 lineages. Our H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay also exhibited good linearity (R\n2 = 0.99) and high sensitivity for detecting in vitro\u2010transcribed HA gene RNA from the Y280\u2010lineage virus A/Hunan/44558/2015 (H9N2) and the G1\u2010lineage virus A/chicken/Egypt/F12173D/2016 (H9N2) (Figure 2). The H9 HA gene RNA was detected for all isolates of both lineages examined in this study at the equivalent of a minimum of 5 copies of the M gene per reaction (Table 2). Therefore, the sensitivity of the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay is comparable to that of our previously developed rRT\u2010PCR assay for the universal detection of M genes of all influenza A viruses 26. The sensitivity of the assay was at least 10\u2010 and 100\u2010fold lower for A/duck/Hokkaido/31/97 (Korean lineage) and A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 (North American lineage), respectively, compared with other Y280\u2010 or G1\u2010lineage viruses. The A/duck/Hokkaido/31/97 virus had one mismatch in the forward primer region and four mismatches in the reverse primer region, whereas the A/turkey/Wisconsin/1/66 virus had four mismatches in the forward primer region, three mismatches in the reverse primer region and one mismatch in the probe region. As these viruses had many more mismatches in the primer/probe regions compared with the other viruses examined, the decrease in sensitivity was attributed to these mismatches. However, the mismatches in the primer and probe sequences are not conserved in recently described viruses of the Y280 and G1 lineages (data not shown). Moreover, there are no reports to date of human infections caused by viruses of the Korean and North American lineages derived from poultry. Reports of Y280\u2010 and G1\u2010lineage viruses with an HA\u2010Q226L substitution are increasing 7, 8, 34. The adaptation of Y280 and G1 lineages to humans may be dependent on HA\u2010L226, which prefers \u03b1\u20102,6\u2010linked sialic acids 35. These results suggest that the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay described here is highly sensitive for current epidemic strains of the Y280 and G1 lineages in poultry that are transmissible to humans.",

Therefore, a highly sensitive detection system is needed to diagnose cases of human infection with AIV. An evaluation of the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay using artificially reconstituted clinical samples showed that the assay could detect a small viral load (Cp > 30) of H9N2 when the specimen contained a viral load of seasonal influenza A virus higher (Cp < 23.25) than the amount of spiked H9N2 virus (Table 5). In all artificially reconstituted clinical specimens containing influenza B virus and non\u2010influenza viruses, the Cp values for the H9 and type A rRT\u2010PCR assays were almost the same as that for diluted H9N2 virus in PBS. These results suggested that the sensitivity of the H9 rRT\u2010PCR assay is sufficient and that there are no non\u2010specific reactions or interference in analyses of clinical specimens with and without seasonal influenza virus.",
