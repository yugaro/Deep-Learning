            "text": "Given the aforementioned biovariability in connection with hippocampal gene expression, I wanted to explore whether, via mathematical modeling, I could generate a function that could classify the 40 subjects with a high accuracy. Such a model would be valuable in future studies of global gene expression analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue investigating biological and chronological aging. To that end, I randomly selected approximately 70% of the subjects [11/15 young subjects and 18/25 old subjects] for the development of the function (henceforward referred to as super variable), and I used the remaining subjects (4 young and 7 old) solely for the purpose of validating the super variable. Employing a general methodology that I have previously introduced67, I was able to generate a super variable (function) that, based on the input of 7 genes from the 36 most significant genes, was able to identify/classify accurately all but one of the old subjects {subject # 33 [64 yrs (F)]} [sensitivity = (24/25) = 0.96] and all of the young subjects [specificity = (15/15) = 1.00]. Those overall results of the performance of the F1 super variable were obtained by combining the results from the development and the validation phases. According to the rank that appears in Table 1, the seven genes that provide the input to the F1 super variable are: C4A (C4B), ADORA3, MS4A7, BCL6, CD44, C3AR1, and HLA-DRB1. All of those seven genes are, in terms of biological function, either genes of inflammation or genes of immune system activation. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the F1 super variable function in relation to its 7 input gene variables. Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3 show the overall results of the F1 super variable, i.e. the F1 scores of all 40 subjects used in this study, as well as their respective classification. Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3 were created by combining the results from the development phase (the F1 scores of all 29 subjects that were randomly selected and used exclusively for the development of the model) with the results from the validation phase (the F1 scores of all 11 subjects that were randomly selected and used exclusively for testing purposes). The results of the F1 super variable in the development phase are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4, whereas the results in the validation phase are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5.",

The results of my study corroborate those observations. Looking at the expression of the 36 most significant hippocampal genes of all 40 subjects [15 young (columns 1\u201315) and 25 old (columns 16\u201340)] in Fig. 2, one notices that four old subjects {# 22, 27, 33, and 35 [80 yrs (M), 83 yrs (M), 64 yrs (F), & 86 yrs (M), respectively]} displayed gene expression patterns that were distinctly closer to those of the young subjects than the patterns of the rest of the old subjects. Conversely, the same observation, albeit in the opposite direction, can be made for one of the young subjects {# 2 [45 yrs (F)]}. The results of K-Means clustering analysis supported numerically those observations (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the aforementioned observations about the biovariability of the aging process were also supported by the results of hierarchical clustering analysis performed on the F1 scores of all 40 subjects (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

The fact that definitive causality cannot be established here notwithstanding \u2013 in other words, whether it is the normal aging process that induces inflammation/immune-system-overactivity, or whether the vice versa occurs, or whether another, hitherto unspecified, process engenders the normal aging process, which in turn induces inflammation/immune-system-overactivity, or whether that unspecified process engenders inflammation/immune-system-overactivity, which in turn induces the normal aging process \u2013 the results of my study support a direct causal link between the normal aging process and the process of inflammation/immune-system-overactivity. When considered collectively, therefore, the results of my study and all of the above observations from the other aforementioned studies point to a plausible theory on the normal aging process. At some point in time, chronic, low-level inflammation establishes itself and elicits a corresponding chronic immune response and activity. These two conjugate processes ultimately are responsible for a gradual loss of synaptic plasticity, particularly LTP in the hippocampus, accompanied with a minimal neuronal loss3334123. It is this loss of synaptic plasticity \u2013 at least in the hippocampus part of the brain \u2013 that is associated with the phenotypical changes of normal aging.",

The magnitude of the neuroinflammatory processes in the case of Alzheimer disease or other neurodegenerative diseases, however, cannot be compared to that of the neuroinflammation in the normal aging process; and by virtue of the same argument, the task of halting neuronal cell loss during the course of a neurodegenerative disease cannot be compared to that of restoring synaptic plasticity during the course of the normal aging process. It would stand to reason, therefore, that anti-inflammatory treatment strategies may be more successful and efficacious than those employed against the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, I should point out that, based on increased evidence over the last twenty years or so, neuroinflammation seems to be the common denominator of normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer. Understanding the causal circumstances under which a chronic, low-level neuroinflammatory process can transition to a major neuroinflammation conducive to neuronal degeneration and death would be of paramount importance. According to the latest evidence37, even a single substitution mutation on a single inflammation gene might suffice to trigger that transition in a small percentage of the population.",

With regard to the housekeeping genes, there was no statistically significant differential expression between the two groups (Supplementary Table 7). As can be seen by the results of K-Means clustering analysis in Fig. 1a, the two groups cannot be discriminated based on the expression of the housekeeping genes. Having, thus, established the quality of the data, I investigated for any differential expression among all gene variables using three different and independent methods. 1) Using a methodology that I have developed and introduced previously3839404142, I performed ROC curve analysis on all gene variables in order to assess their discriminating power with respect to the two groups (old vs. young), and with respect to this method, I set statistical significance at ROC AUC \u2265 0.920. 2) For a given gene variable, I defined fold change (FC) as the mean expression value of the old subjects (O) over the mean expression value of the young subjects (Y), and I set statistical significance at FC \u2265 1.10 (if O > Y) or FC \u2264 0.91 (if O < Y). 3) I performed independent t-Tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or Aspin-Welch unequal-variance tests (depending on how a particular gene variable was distributed), and having accounted for all possible comparisons (there are 54,675 probe sets in the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chip), I set the significance level at \u03b1 = 9.15 \u00d7 10\u22127. The results according to those three different and independent methods, and prior to the final selection, are shown in Supplementary Table 8. In order to minimize the number of false negatives in the case of the third method4344, for the final selection of significant variables, I imposed the condition that if a given gene variable met the significance criteria of all three methods, or those of the first method and those of only one of the other two methods, it would be deemed significant. Excluding multiplicities (different transcripts that corresponded to the same genes), thirty six genes made up the final list of the most significantly differentially expressed genes between the two groups, as assessed by the aforementioned three different and independent methods of statistical significance (Table 1).",

To that end, I randomly selected approximately 70% of the subjects [11/15 young subjects and 18/25 old subjects] that could be used only for the development phase of such function. In other words, a function could be developed only by the exclusive use of those 29 subjects. The remaining 11 subjects (4 young and 7 old ones) were designated unknown (test) subjects and were used solely for the purpose of validating any promising function generated in the development phase. This split into two fixed sets, whereby one is used only for training and the other only for validation, represents the simplest implementation of K-fold cross validation4546. A function was deemed promising in the development phase only if it exhibited a sensitivity \u2265 0.90 and a specificity \u2265 0.90 in connection with the 29 subjects of the development phase. Pertaining to the validation phase, and in connection with the 11 unknown subjects, a promising function would have to exhibit the same minimum classification accuracy (a sensitivity \u2265 0.90 and a specificity \u2265 0.90) in order to be accepted.
