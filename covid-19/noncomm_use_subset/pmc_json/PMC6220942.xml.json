            "text": "Lectins are sugar\u2010binding proteins that engage in interactions with endogenous and exogenous glycans. The interactions between lectins and carbohydrates are involved in many fundamental biological events, from cell adhesion to antigen recognition and internalization, inflammation, or quality control in protein folding. The most abundant class of animal lectins are the C\u2010type lectin receptors (CLRs) serving a broad range of functions. They are involved in pathogen recognition and in prevention of autoimmunity by contributing to the immune system's ability to identify carbohydrate\u2010based pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and damaged\u2010self\u2010associated molecular patterns (DAMP).They take part in signal transduction, cell trafficking, and in the induction of T\u2010cell differentiation. Their name, C\u2010type lectins, indicates the presence of a Ca2+ ion in their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). This ion is the primary site of carbohydrate interaction and typically coordinates two vicinal hydroxyl groups on a sugar ring. Many C\u2010type lectin receptors are yet to be explored and described in detail with regard to their CRD structure, carbohydrate binding specificities, and the molecular factors governing the interaction with glycans. However, it is known that the CRDs of CLRs feature evolutionarily conserved groups of residues that coordinate the Ca2+ ion and determine the monosaccharide binding specificity of the CLR. So, a Glu\u2010Pro\u2010Asn (EPN) motif results in a preference for mannose (Man), N\u2010acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose (Fuc), or glucose (Glc) residues, whereas a Gln\u2010Pro\u2010Asp (QPD) sequence leads to recognition of galactose (Gal) and N\u2010acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).1 Available data also suggests that the extended binding sites of CLRs often display a higher affinity towards larger glycan structures, thanks to additional interactions occurring in the vicinity of the primary Ca2+ site.2 Thus, complex glycans exposing the same monosaccharide can bind to CLRs with very different affinities, depending on the accessibility of the recognition element and on additional features of the lectin binding sites. Structural studies also demonstrate that secondary binding sites can alter the affinity and specificity of the CLR towards ligands. As an example, langerin,3 a transmembrane CLR expressed on Langerhans\u2010cells, and the dendritic\u2010cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule\u20103\u2010grabbing non\u2010integrin (DC\u2010SIGN), a CLR expressed by dendritic cells (DCs)4 share similar primary binding sites with similar specificity for oligomannosides, but langerin has an additional calcium\u2010independent sugar\u2010binding site and binds to large sulfated glycosamino glycans, whereas DC\u2010SIGN does not.5\n",

            "text": "Given the key role played by lectins in biological systems, many research groups have turned their attention towards the development of glycomimetic molecules to be used as selective probes for the study of sugar\u2013protein interactions and/or for medicinal chemistry purposes.6 Glycomimetics present several advantages as drug candidates over natural glycans, since they can be made metabolically more stable, more bioavailable, and possibly more active and selective than natural oligosaccharides. Our previous studies have focused on inhibiting the dendritic cell receptor DC\u2010SIGN, a CLR implicated in viral and bacterial infections.7 The primary binding site of DC\u2010SIGN CRD recognizes mannose oligosaccharides, l\u2010fucose residues in Lewis\u2010type blood antigens,4 and biantennary N\u2010glycans with terminal GlcNAc moieties.8 Additional druggable sites on the lectin have been described recently.9 DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated adhesion to dendritic cells is the first step of several viral infections, notably by HIV and Ebola viruses.10 Glycomimetic antagonists of DC\u2010SIGN have mainly been designed starting from high mannose glycans, like Man9 (Man)9(GlcNAc)2 (1, Figure 1), or from LeX (Fuc\u03b11,3\u2010(Gal\u03b21,4\u2010)\u2010GlcNAc) (2)\u2010type structures. In particular, pseudo\u2010di and tri\u2010mannoside fragments (3\u20136) were synthesized11 as mimics of the D2 and D3 arms of Man9 (Figure 1). When used in multivalent constructs, they were found to block DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated infection with activities up to the nanomolar level both in HIV and Ebola infection models.12 Notably, the bisbenzylamide derivatives 6 a\n11c and 6 b\n11d also exhibited strong selectivity towards DC\u2010SIGN and did not bind to langerin, a CLR that shares with DC\u2010SIGN a similar set of ligands but, rather than spreading the infection, facilitates HIV eradication.13These results suggested that, with appropriate modifications, the structure of 6 could represent a general template to generate a diverse library of glycomimetics containing one natural monosaccharide as the lectin\u2010targeting element and a tuning unit, which could provide additional functional elements for interaction with the lectin in the proximity of the primary binding site. As mentioned above, the structure of 6 derives from mimicry of the Man\u03b11\u20102Man disaccharide, the terminal unit of the D1\u2013D3 arms of Man9 and a common disaccharide ligand for DC\u2010SIGN (PDB: 2IT6) and for other CLRs of the immune system with similar specificity, such as DC\u2010SIGNR,14 langerin (PDB: 3P5F),15 and dectin\u20102 (PDB: 5VYB).16 Screening such a library against these CLRs in a microarray format may become a potent tool for glycomimetic drug discovery.17 Glycan microarrays, as introduced and developed over the past 15 years, have been an essential tool in the characterization of lectin specificity,18 and have been used to pave the way for the therapeutic exploitation of vital lectin\u2013sugar interactions.\n",

The glycomimetic library was not conceived to specifically target one lectin, but rather to broadly interact with CLRs that contain the EPN motif in their CRD. Therefore, the required set of amines was selected for diversity, with the help of chemoinformatic tools and based on commercial availability. Lead\u2010like physicochemical filters were applied to a large number of amines from available commercial collections (see the Experimental Section) and the selection was sifted to exclude any structural incompatibility. The remaining structures were then clustered by chemoinformatic descriptors and representatives of the various subgroups were selected based on their availability. Overall, a collection of 38 diverse amines were selected (Figure 2), which allowed us to prepare the Man\u2010based derivatives 12.1\u201339 (Scheme 1, Figure 2).",

This set\u2010up presents the additional advantage of allowing the glycomimetics to be printed alongside existing glycan libraries, which are typically functionalized with aminoterminated linkers.20 To this end, commercially available N\u2010{(1R,8S,9S)\u2010bicyclo[6.1.0]non\u20104\u2010yn\u20109\u2010ylmethyloxycarbonyl}\u20101,8\u2010diamino\u20103,6\u2010dioxaoctane (16, Scheme 2) was submitted to selective, rapid, and bioorthogonal strain\u2010promoted azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), as described by Agard et al.21 yielding conjugates 17 and 18 (Figure 2).

Although DC\u2010SIGN is known to bind fucosylated oligosaccharides, they all consist of \u03b1\u2010fucosides, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, \u03b2\u2010fucosides have not been explored before. The mannose\u2010based ligands identified by red bars in Figure 4 had originally been designed as DC\u2010SIGN antagonists and tested by SPR as inhibitors of DC\u2010SIGN binding to mannosylated BSA.11c Both the SPR data and the microarray results indicate that all these compounds have a similar affinity for the lectin, with the methyl ester 17.2 being the least effective of the series. None of the additional modifications of the amide functionality attempted in this library was found to improve on the previous design. On the other hand, very low fluorescence intensity was detected for all tertiary amide derivatives (17.10, 17.20, 17.30, 17.36, 17.37, 17.38, and 17.39) on the chip.

Many of the mannose\u2010based ligands interact with the protein more effectively than mannose itself (19.2) and the binding profile is rather similar to that observed for DC\u2010SIGN. Four ligands (17.11, 17.15, 17.19, and 17.27, all shown as blue bars in Figure 3 B) were selected for further analysis and the affinity of the corresponding recognition elements 12.11, 12.15, 12.19, and 12.27 for DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR was evaluated using an SPR inhibition assay that measures their ability to inhibit protein binding to mannosylated bovine serum albumin (Man\u2010BSA) (Figure 3 C). The results show some obvious differences in the way the ligands are classified by the two assays. In particular, the IC50 value measured by SPR for 12.11 and DC\u2010SIGN is higher than expected based on the array profile. This may simply reflect the intrinsic differences of the physical processes interrogated in the two assays: in the microarray setup, direct binding of the tetravalent lectins to a multivalent\u2010functionalized surface is observed; in the SPR inhibition assay, the ligands are scored based on the strength of their monovalent interaction with the protein. A strong dependence of the affinity values measured for carbohydrate\u2010protein complexes and even an influence on the observed binding selectivity of lectins on the physical format of the assay was noted early on and repeatedly confirmed for various systems.33 Once again, our data suggest that multiple analytical methods need to be applied to fully characterize the interaction of lectins with synthetic or natural ligands. This represents an additional element of complexity for the discovery of selective lectin antagonists. However it is still possible, using data from various techniques, to identify ligands of potential interest in drug discovery programs and to ascertain the structural features that concur to determine their activity and selectivity.

Interestingly, this disaccharide is a common natural ligand of all the C\u2010type lectins tested in this study, which on the contrary differ strongly in their ability to interact with fucose\u2010containing oligosaccharides.

As often observed in the study of sugar\u2013protein interactions, the affinity and binding selectivity measured for lectins can strongly depend on the format of the assay, in ways that complicate the discovery process. In the case at hand, the clustered ligand presentation on the array can strongly influence the avidity of the system in ways that cannot be reproduced by binding inhibition experiments, where the monovalent ligand in solution is competing against an immobilized glycoprotein. Thus, the SPR and array binding data should be regarded as complementary information, describing different features of the ligand\u2013lectin interaction. The microarray format of the test we propose here allows the binding profiles of lectins to be analyzed even if they are available only in minute quantities, as is the case for dectin\u20102 in this study, and may provide structural information useful in the design of multivalent inhibitors that mimic the dense ligand presentation of the array surface. Further characterization of the binding properties of dectin\u20102 binders, as well as their structural optimization will be the object of active investigation in our laboratories.",

To reduce the compounds to a number amenable to visual inspection 20 % of the cluster centers was selected maximizing molecular diversity (based on FCFP4 fingerprints). This resulted in a set of 1116 primary amines (630 aliphatic and 486 aromatic) and 796 secondary amines (472 aliphatic and 324 aromatic).

Expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1\u2010thio\u2010d\u2010galactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture had reached an A600 nm of 0.8 and was maintained for 3 h. The protein was expressed in the cytoplasm as inclusion bodies. Cells were harvested by a 20 min centrifugation at 5000 g at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was re\u2010suspended in 30 mL of a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris\u2010HCl, pH 8 and one antiprotease mixture tablet (Complete EDTA free, Roche).

The diluted mixture was dialyzed against ten volumes of 25 mm Tris\u2010HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) with three buffer changes. After dialysis, insoluble precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant containing DC\u2010SIGNR ECD was loaded on Mannan agarose column (Sigma) for purification by affinity chromatography equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, DC\u2010SIGNR ECD was tightly bound to the column and eluted in the same buffer without CaCl2 but supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (buffer B). This step was followed by SEC (size exclusion chromatography) by using a Superose 6 column (GE Heathcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS\u2010PAGE (12 %) and DC\u2010SIGNR ECD containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10 membrane from Amicon). The supernatant containing the Strep tagged dectin\u20102 ECD was loaded onto a StrepTrap HP column (GE Heathcare) at 4 \u00b0C. Unbound proteins were washed away with buffer A before dectin\u20102 ECD was eluted with buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris\u2010HCl, pH 8, 4 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm d\u2010desthiobiotin).
