            "text": "Despite their broad uses in life sciences, transient expression by plasmid-based expression systems has significant drawbacks. First, the transfer of plasmid DNA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a rate-limiting process in non-dividing cells. This limits efficient plasmid-based expression systems to dividing cells, in which this barrier is overcome by temporary disassembly of the nuclear membrane during mitosis (1,2). Such limited transfer to the nucleus of exogenous DNA in quiescent cells is a potential drawback for the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Second, plasmid-based expression depends on host cell nuclear RNA polymerase II (polII), a moderately processive enzyme with a rate of elongation of 25 and 6 nucleotides/second in vitro and in cellulo, respectively (3,4). Third, standard plasmid-based eukaryotic expression exploits the host cell transcriptional machinery and thereby competes with the host cell genome for transgene expression (4). Together, these challenges are thought to limit the efficacy of the standard eukaryotic expression systems.",

Once C3P3-G1 enzyme is expressed in the cytoplasm, capped and polyadenylated mRNAs are produced independently of the host cell transcription machinery. We present the first generation of the C3P3-G1 system (C3P3-G1), which was optimized for mammalian cells. This system shows promising results for transient expression in some mammalian cell lines including CHO-K1, while less efficient in other cell lines and therefore requiring further optimization.",

All pCMV-C3P3-G1 plasmids and derivatives had the same design: IE1 promoter/enhancer from the human cytomegalovirus (CMV), 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR), Kozak consensus sequence followed by the ORFs of the C3P3-G1 enzymes, 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR), and SV40 polyadenylation signal. Substitution of the coding sequence components from the C3P3-G1 enzymes was enabled by digestion at endonuclease restriction enzyme sites of six nucleotides located between each domain of the coding sequences of the C3P3-G1 enzyme (i.e. NH2 terminus, upstream and downstream to the linker) and eight nucleotides immediately downstream to stop codon. The C3P3-G1 enzyme plasmids are identified by the different modules in the ORF of the C3P3-G1 enzyme downstream to the IE1 human CMV promoter/enhancer.

The T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), their prototype, synthesizes RNA in vitro at a rate of 250 nucleotides/second and produces transcripts devoid of 5\u2032-caps (22). Given the importance of capping for mRNA stability and translation initiation (23), we sought to determine if the translational efficiency of T7-transcripts by mammalian cells could be increased by mRNA capping. To investigate protein expression from T7 promoter-driven transcripts, the wild-type T7RNAP open reading frame (ORF) was subcloned downstream of the CMV promoter (pCMV-T7RNAP). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, T7RNAP was found in cytoplasm, whereas in-frame fusion of a SV40 nuclear localization signal at the amino-terminus redirected T7RNAP to the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S1) (24). A reporter plasmid was generated by cloning the Firefly luciferase gene under control of the \u03c610 T7-phage promoter from the major capsid protein (pT7\u03c610-Luciferase) (25). This reporter plasmid also contains a 40 adenosine track to ensure artificial polyadenylation, followed by the self-cleaving genomic hepatitis D ribozyme (26). Following co-transfection of pCMV-T7RNAP and pT7\u03c610-Luciferase plasmids in HEK-293 cells, luciferase expression was monitored by conventional luciferin oxidation assays and normalized (Figure 1). As expected, low levels of luciferase expression were seen in transfected HEK-293 cells (Figure 2).",

This elegant expression system relies on infection of mammalian cells by a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding T7RNAP, which transcribes target genes under control of the T7-promoter embedded in a second recombinant vaccinia virus or plasmid. The transcripts produced by this system can receive 5\u2032-cap and 3\u2032-polyadenylation by the vaccinia virus capping and polyadenylation machineries, respectively (30). Although this expression system is able to generate up to 30% of the total cytoplasmic RNA, only 5\u201310% of the T7-transcripts are capped and 25% of them are polyadenylated, which suggests insufficient synergy between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries (30,31).",

In contrast, the absence of coupling between the T7RNAP and capping enzyme of the hybrid vaccinia virus-T7RNAP expression system possibly accounts for the poor capping rate of T7-transcripts (30). Hence, we chose to increase the proximity of T7RNAP and vaccinia virus capping enzyme by directly coupling these enzymes together. This approach therefore differs from the strategy used by others (37\u201339), in which nuclear-directed-T7RNAP was fused with the carboxyl terminal domain from POLR2A (40), which interacts with the host-cell nuclear capping enzyme (41). Although this fusion was sought to bring these enzymes together, it generates neither capped nor spliced transcripts but instead promotes formation of DNA:RNA hybrids (37,38).",

Since capping by C3P3 dramatically increased translation of T7p-derived mRNAs, we reasoned that if mRNAs remained uncapped by C3P3, then supplementation with auxiliary NP868R enzyme should further increase translation over C3P3 alone. To direct auxiliary NP868R to luciferase reporter mRNAs, we fused NP868R to the \u03bbN peptide of \u03bb-phage which binds boxB RNA hairpins at nanomolar affinity (7), and added four BoxBr hairpins to the 3\u2032UTR of the firefly luciferase gene (Figure 4). As expected, \u03bbN-NP868R plus T7RNAP caused higher luciferase expression than T7RNAP alone, demonstrating the functionality \u03bbN-NP868R and also the value of capping. \u03bbN-NP868R also complemented expression by capping-dead mutant (K282N) C3P3-G1. However, addition of \u03bbN-NP868R with C3P3-G1 marginally increased luciferase expression over C3P3 alone, suggesting that capping was already nearly saturated by C3P3. Similar findings we obtained with transcripts produced by standard nuclear expression system using CMV-driven promoter. These findings support that a majority of transcripts are efficiently capped by C3P3.",

Twenty-nine RNAPs with well-characterized promoters were then subjected to BLAST+ analysis (56), and clustered into 12 subgroups having <80% amino-acid identity (Supplementary Figure S9). One member of each subgroup was randomly selected and fused to the carboxyl-end of NP868R via (G4S)4 linker (Supplementary Table S5). For each RNAP, the putative phage promoter from the major capsid protein was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene and co-transfected with the corresponding C3P3-G1 enzyme plasmids (Supplementary Table S5). While highest luciferase expression was achieved with SP6RNAP moiety (Figure 3D), additional phage RNAPs having >80% amino-acid identity with SP6RNAP were examined in a second optimization step. The two closely related K1ERNAP and K1.5RNAP, which share 99% amino-acid identity together and 85% with SP6RNAP (57), were identified and fused in-frame with NP868R with best results given by K1ERNAP (Figure 3D).

To test if NP868R has all bona fide enzymatic activities, we expressed and purified histidine-tagged NP868R by baculovirus expression system and Ni2+-affinity chromatography, respectively (Figure 5A). The NTPase activity of NP868R was evidenced by in vitro conversion assay of [\u03b1-32P]-GTP or ATP into GDP or ATP. Figure 5B shows that NP868R displayed NTPase activity similar to that of the VVD1R subunit, which hydrolyses [\u03b1-32P]-GTP into GDP, or ATP into ADP (not shown). The GTase activity results from two steps reaction process in which the GTase first form a covalent link with GMP which is subsequently transferred on the 5\u2032 end of pRNA. The first step of this process (GTP-covalent binding) was demonstrated through incubation of NP868R with [\u03b1-32P]-GTP and MgCl2. A radiolabeled 99 kDa protein was observed under denaturing electrophoresis conditions, suggesting that NP868R forms a covalent adduct with the guanosine nucleotide similar to VVD1R and VVD1R-\u0394MTase (Figure 5C). The subsequent transfer of GMP to the 5\u2032-end of RNAs was next monitored by incubating NP868R with synthetic 3\u2032-end radiolabeled RNAs (pppAC4Cp), followed by urea-PAGE RNA product analysis. In presence of MgCl2, NP868R induced a band-shift of RNA products. Migration patterns were similar to those observed when using VVD1R and VVD1R-\u0394MTase as positive controls, suggesting similar modification at the 5\u2032-end of RNA blocked at their 3\u2032-end by pCp labeling (Figure 5D). The nature of the cap structure was further analyzed by thin layer chromatography after RNA hydrolysis by nuclease P1. In the presence of the methyl donor S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) and MgCl2, the positive control VVD1R, as well as NP868R could synthesize a m7GpppA cap structure (Figure 5E), indicating that NP868R carries both N7-MTase and GTase activities. NP868R methylated GpppAC4, whereas a blocked N7-atom in the synthetic capped RNA (m7GpppAC4 substrate) abolished 3H-methyl transfer. NP868R thus carries N7-MTase but not ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activities on these short substrates (Figure 5F). Altogether, these assays demonstrate that NP868R is a fully active capping enzyme.",

All experiments were performed using DNA templates, which were optimized in both HEK-293 and CHO-K1 cells with similar results (data not shown). As judged by immunofluorescence microcopy, C3P3-G1 drives expression and localization of fluorescent proteins tagged for transport in the expected nuclear, mitochondrial, and endosomal compartments (Figure 7). The localization of these fluorescent proteins to the endosomal and mitochondrial compartments was confirmed by the coexpression of EGFP fused to the human LDLR and rat OCT sorting signals, respectively (Supplementary Figure S13). Noticeably, the morphological patterns of these fluorescent proteins appear similar when expressed using a standard nuclear expression system, therefore suggesting that the C3P3-G1 does not impair protein sorting (Figure 7). To further confirm that the proteins produced by the C3P3-G1 system were properly processed, we assayed in culture medium the functional activity of the released hEPO, a N- and O-glycosylated secreted protein (60). Its activity was similar when produced by C3P3-G1 versus standard nuclear expression systems, showing normal protein folding and disulfide bond formation (Figure 8). Taken together, the findings confirm that the expression of C3P3 transcripts generates normal proteins.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first artificial expression system that successfully couples transcription and post-transcription, which are processes of exquisite complexity in eukaryotes. C3P3-G1 relies on a single-unit chimeric enzyme that consists of the fusion of an mRNA capping enzyme with a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase moiety of the C3P3 enzyme transcribes in cellulo specific DNA templates under control of the C3P3 promoter and synthesizes RNA chains, which are subsequently capped by the capping enzyme moiety. In contrast, the polyadenylation of the C3P3 transcripts is synthesized by transcription of a polyadenosine track from the DNA templates. Therefore, once primed, the C3P3 expression system autonomously synthesizes RNA chains in the cytoplasm of the host-cell and generates the key modifications requested for their translation.",

            "text": "To ensure mRNA capping of C3P3-G1 transcripts, we pursued an approach that has benefited greatly from the vaccinia virus-T7RNAP expression system. This latter approach makes use of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the T7RNAP, while the target gene, under control of a T7 promoter, is either embedded in a plasmid or a second recombinant vaccinia virus (28,29). As the vaccinia virus is an intracellular parasite that replicates exclusively in the host-cell cytoplasm, the T7-transcripts are 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032polyadenylated in host-cell cytoplasm by the vaccinia virus enzymes (30). Although the amounts of mRNA made by this system are extremely high, comprising \u223c30% of the total steady state RNA in the cytoplasm, only moderate amounts of T7-transcripts are properly 5\u2032-capped (30). A plausible explanation for these findings is provided by the crowded environment of the cytoplasm, which contains a dense network of cytoskeletal filaments, therefore impeding free diffusion of large macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and mRNA (61). Due to the lack of coupling between the T7RNAP and vaccinia virus capping enzyme, the T7-transcripts are poorly 5\u2032-processed by the vaccinia virus capping enzyme. This assumption was central for the development of the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which is preferably the fusion between the African Swine Fever Virus capping enzyme and a mutant bacteriophage K1E RNA polymerase.",

The resulting 3\u2032-poly(A) tail cooperates synergistically with the 5\u2032-capping to stimulate translation with supra-additive potentiation, presumably by circularizing mRNA (62). In addition, poly(A) tails promote stability of the transcripts, while deadenylation is a major rate-limiting step in mRNA decay (63,64). In contrast to the nuclear polyadenylation, the poly(A) tail of the C3P3-G1 is generated by the template-dependent transcription of a short 40 adenosine track from the DNA template, followed by a self-cleaving ribozyme sequence. The length of the poly(A) tail of the C3P3-G1 transcripts encoded by the templates is therefore much shorter than those of mammalian transcripts, which exit the nucleus with a uniform length of \u223c250 nucleotides (65\u201368). As the length of the poly(A) tail is strongly correlated with the level of gene expression (69), the polyadenylation from the C3P3-G1 expression system can be seen as sub-optimal. Further generations of the C3P3 system will improve the polyadenylation process, possibly by tethering a poly(A) polymerase to the C3P3 transcripts.",

Such incomplete mRNA translational efficiency might be explained by various mechanisms. Firstly, the mRNA modifications performed by the current generation of the C3P3 system might be incomplete. Our semi-quantitative assay (Figure 4) suggests that the majority of mRNAs are capped by C3P3-G1. Nevertheless, even minor amounts of uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA might induce retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-mediated interferon-\u03b1 response and host-cell translation shut-down (70,71). Interferon-\u03b1 response can be also induced by the absence of cap-1 at the 5\u2032-ends of transcripts, which is not accommodated by C3P3-G1 (72). Strikingly, no frank modifications of ribosome distribution patterns were brought into focus by polysome profiling analysis. This finding does not support the hypothesis of global inhibition of host-cell translation as expected in case of strong interferon-response, but closer investigation of content of the polysomal fractions. The length of the polyadenylation tail is also known be critical for mRNA translation and should be increased by further generations of the C3P3 system. Secondly, other post-transcriptional modifications which are not performed by C3P3-G1 might be critical for mRNA translational efficiency. For instance, the reversible N6,2\u2032-O-dimethyladenosine methylation at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the cap was recently found to influence cellular mRNA fate (73). Alternatively, the absence of other modifications might induce the shut-down of host-cell translation, via interferon pathway or others (70). For instance, internal bases can be subjected to modifications such as pseudouridination or methylation at uridine or cytosine residues, which decrease RNA-dependent protein kinase activation in response to exogenous RNA, then phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-\u03b1 (eIF2-\u03b1) and inhibits translation (74,75). Thirdly, host-cell proteins, eventually deposited onto pre-messenger RNA or mRNA, might participate in translation. For instance, the exon junction complex, which is assembled onto pre-messenger RNA at the nuclear stage, contributes to both mRNA translational efficiency and decay (76,77). Fourthly, C3P3 transcripts might be inappropriately positioned in the cytoplasmic compartment for their translation by the host-cell machinery. For comparison, large cytoplasmic replicating DNA viruses, such as Poxvirus or Asfarvirus, form viral factories that sequester transcription factors, ribosomes, and chaperonins in circumscribed cytoplasmic sub-compartments. Altogether, these hypotheses will be systemically explored by deeper transcriptional and translational analysis for further improvements of the C3P3 system.",

            "text": "In contrast to the standard nuclear expression systems that require access to the host-cell nuclear transcriptional machinery, the C3P3-G1 system has been devised as an autonomous cytoplasmic expression system. Therefore, once expression of the C3P3 enzyme has been primed, it becomes independent of the passive diffusion of the input DNA through the nuclear pores. The diameter of their main channel, which is smaller than the classical diameter of plasmid DNA, explains their limited diffusion to the nucleus and possibly the limited efficacy of transient transfection (78). For example, only 1\u201310% of the plasmids transfected to cultured cells can effectively reach their nuclei as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, Southern blot analysis, or electron microscopy (79,80). Hence, the cytoplasmic processivity of the C3P3 system appears appealing for transient non-viral gene therapy, an attractive approach to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids for human therapeutics (81). Non-viral gene therapy appears much safer and less immunogenic than recombinant viruses and has the potential to deliver larger genetic payloads (81). However, its efficacy appears relatively limited, which has greatly hampered its uses (82). We therefore anticipate that the C3P3 system can be used for non-viral gene therapy, especially for disorders involving quiescent cells such as hepatocytes, skeletal muscular cells or naive immune B or T cells.",

Protein ladder is shown on the right lane. (B) NTPase activity. Autoradiographs of 20% urea-PAGE gel show that NP868R and the D1R subunit of VV (VVD1\u0394MTase) hydrolyze [\u03b1-32P] radio-labeled GTP to GDP. The hydrolysis of GTP by NP868R is stimulated by 2.5 mM MgCl2. (C) GTP-binding assay. Autoradiographs of 12% SDS-PAGE show that NP868R, VVD1R\u0394MTase and VVD1R form covalent adducts, after 1 h of incubation with [\u03b1-32P] radio-labeled GTP in presence of 2.5 mM MgCl2. The main radiolabeled bands are detected at a molecular weight corresponding to the incubated proteins. (D) GTase activity. A synthetic RNA (pppAC4), radiolabeled at its 3\u2032-end using [\u03b1-32P]-pCp (pppAC4-Cp*, Ctl) is incubated with NP868R, VVD1R\u0394MTase and VVD1R in presence of 1 mM GTP. The RNA reaction products, obtained after 1 h of incubation, are separated on a 20% urea\u2013PAGE gel. The VV-capping enzyme (VVD1R and VVD1\u0394MTase) used as positive control, convert pppAC4-Cp* into m7GpppAC4-Cp* or GpppAC4-Cp*, respectively. The autoradiographs show that, in presence of 2.5 mM MgCl2, NP868R convert pppAC4-Cp* RNA to a RNA migrating a molecular weight similar to the capped RNA generated by VVD1R proteins. (E) Cap structure identification. pppAC4 RNA was incubated with [\u03b1-32P]-GTP in presence of NP868R, VVD1R\u0394MTase and VVD1R respectively. The reaction products were digested by nuclease P1, and the caps were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). m7GpppA is the predominant product seen in presence of the methyl-donor (SAM) using the VVD1, whereas VVD1R\u0394MTase synthesized mainly GpppA, as well as GTP hydrolysis products (GDP and GMP). m7GpppA cap structure is detected when NP868R is incubated with SAM and 2.5 mM MgCl2, and GpppA in absence of SAM.

The bar chart experiment compares the activities of NP868R with that of human N7-MTase (N7-MTase) and SARS-COV 2\u2032O-MTase known to methylate specifically the N7 position of the RNA cap structure and the 2\u2032O position of capped RNA respectively.
