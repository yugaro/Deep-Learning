Pearson correlation coefficients were used to investigate the temporal relationship between the number of KD incidence and viral detection rates. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-sample t-test was used to examine the significant differences in mean KD incidence or viral infection between seasons or months. Seasons were considered by four groups based on the month: spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), autumn (September, October, November), and winter (December, January, February). Graphs were produced using Microsoft Excel and STATA 11.0 software (STATA, College Station, TX, USA). A value of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Because influenza virus was epidemic in the spring of 2010 (March: 275 cases, April: 990 cases, May: 193 cases), December 2010 (936 cases), and January 2011 (752 cases), the viral detection rate was the highest in December, April, and January (Fig. 2). In most other months, fewer than 30 cases of influenza virus were detected (notably, no case was detected in October 2009, July and August 2010, and August 2011).

Using direct fluorescent antibody assays, Jordan-Villegas et al.17) reported that 8.8% of 251 KD patients studied were positive for more than one of 7 different viral respiratory infections (RSV; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; influenza virus A and B; and adenovirus). Using multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Cho et al.18) also revealed that 22% of acute KD patients tested positive for more than one of 11 respiratory viruses {RSV; adenovirus; rhinovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; influenza viruses A and B; human metapneumo virus; human bocavirus; and human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63)}.18) However, these rates of viral infection showed no differences between acute KD patients and febrile patients without KD in a small case-control study (32.7% in 55 acute KD patients versus 30.8% in 78 febrile patients without KD) using a multiplex real-time-PCR assay.19) These reports support the hypothesis that various infectious agents are involved in the onset of KD, but do not cause KD directly.2)14)",

At this time, there is no explanation for the discrepancy between the high incidence of KD and the low viral detection during the summer season. This may suggest the existence of causative agents for KD other than well-known detectable organisms.
