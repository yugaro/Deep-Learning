Like other class I fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV S protein undergoes proteolytic priming prior to fusion activation (2). Several host cell proteases appear to be able to prime fusion activation in the case of SARS-CoV, including cathepsin L, trypsin, factor Xa, thermolysin, plasmin, TMPRSS11a, and elastase (3\u201310). The proteolytic cleavage events in SARS-CoV S that lead to membrane fusion occur both at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains (S1/S2), as well as adjacent to a fusion peptide within S2 (S2\u2032) (11).",

Elastase is known to be secreted by neutrophils as part of an inflammatory response to a viral infection and is also produced by opportunistic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that can colonize virally infected respiratory tissue (14). As such, it has been considered that elastase-mediated activation of SARS-CoV might be an important factor in the severe pneumonia seen in SARS-CoV-infected patients.",

For these studies, pancreatic elastase (or elastase-1) was used as a source of protease. In addition, it has been shown previously that introduction of a furin site at position 797 of SARS-CoV S induced cell-cell fusion independent of the addition of exogenous protease (6). We added a furin cleavage site at different positions in the region 667\u2013797; however, only the addition of a furin cleavage site at position 797 results in cell-cell fusion. Addition of a furin cleavage site at position 773 has no effect on cell-cell fusion (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that to activate fusion, the cleavage event has to occur in the vicinity of the S2\u2032 region.",

We then used these mutants in our quantitative cell-cell fusion assay. In the case of the mutants K793A/T795D, P794A/T795D, T795D/K796A, and T795D/R797A it was apparent that alanine at positions 794 and 797 could be used very efficiently by elastase-1 (Fig. 3). In both these cases, the presence of alanine gave higher levels of fusion than was mediated by Thr795. In addition, maximum fusion was reached with the lowest dose of elastase with the mutant T795D/R797A, even though this mutant shows lower surface expression compared with the wild type protein (27% \u00b1 15) (supplemental Fig. 2). However, the presence of alanine at position 796 did not allow elastase-induced fusion. The T795A mutant gave a high level of background fusion in the absence of elastase addition (presumably via activation by an endogenous protease), so could not be used in cell-cell fusion assays designed to assess the role of elastase (data not shown).",

Our data suggested that fusion activity could be modulated by repositioning of the elastase cleavage site in the vicinity of the S2 fusion peptide. To determine whether this finding also applied to trypsin-mediated cleavage at S2\u2032, we generated a series of mutants that contained arginine residues at positions 795 and 794 in the context of the K796A/R797N background to inhibit the endogenous cleavage site. To allow us to focus on cleavage at the S2\u2032 position, these mutants were generated in a backbone of an S protein containing a furin consensus sequence at the S1/S2 boundary (Fur667), and cell surface expression was monitored. All mutants were expressed at >80% of wild type levels (supplemental Fig. 3). As expected for both cell-cell fusion assays and pseudovirions entry assays, both wild type S and the Fur667 mutants could be activated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with trypsin, whereas the mutant K796A/R797N could not. As with elastase induction, the presence of arginine at position 794 or 795 allows membrane fusion and entry (Fig. 5, A and B).",

These data demonstrate a certain degree of flexibility in the position of the cleavage event activating the fusion process. However, efficacy of infection induced by trypsin is in general better than by elastase. This could be due to the poor recognition of the cleavage site by elastase or due to the shifting of the cleavage site position from the fusion peptide.",

Surprisingly neither trypsin nor elastase is able to activate fusion when the cleavage site is located at position 796, suggesting the inaccessibility of this residue in the protein.

Whereas influenza virus HA is normally cleaved by a trypsin-like enzyme at the sequence IQSR-GLFG (17), it is known that HA can also be efficiently cleaved by Pseudomonas elastase at the sequence IQSRG-LFG (18). However, this elastase cleavage event truncates the critical glycine that comprises the N terminus of the fusion peptide, and so renders HA nonfunctional for fusion. In contrast, the coronavirus S2\u2032 fusion peptide appears to be composed of a small helical loop that is physically separated from the cleavage site itself (11, 19). This organization may allow the possibility of modulating fusion peptide function by shifting the relative position of the core fusion peptide residues relative to the site of cleavage, a scenario that is generally consistent with our data. Overall, it is possible that fusion activity for coronaviruses may be impacted both by the activity of the specific protease and the positioning of cleavage relative to the S2 fusion peptide, with mutations in the region having implications for changes in pathogenesis or host range.",

In contrast to the situation with elastase-1, our initial studies with neutrophil elastase failed to give any consistent activation of SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion (data not shown). Neutrophil elastase (elastase-2) has a less specific MEROPS consensus cleavage site of \u2212/\u2212/\u2212/VIAT\u2193\u2212/\u2212/\u2212/\u2212 (compared with A/\u2212/P/AV\u2193\u2212/\u2212/\u2212/\u2212 for elastase-1), and so the reasons behind the lack of activation by elastase-2 are unclear at present. We are currently exploring the use of elastase-2 and elastases produced by opportunistic bacteria in more detail, to define the relevance of elastase activation for viral pathogenesis. The novel mechanism for modulation of fusion protein function shown here, shifting the cleavage site position relative to the core residues of the fusion peptide, indicates that this may be a significant factor in disease outcome or in the ability of coronaviruses to undergo host range changes.",
