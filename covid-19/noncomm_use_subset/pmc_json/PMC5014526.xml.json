Up to now, 844 cases from 16 countries have been documented in the World Health Organization with the fatality rate of ~53% (2003\u20132015), among which 52 cases were confirmed in China (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/). Exposure to sick poultry was considered a major risk factor of H5N1 infection.3 However, several episodes of potential human-to-human transmission raised more concerns about H5N1 pandemic.4",

It has been proved that H5N1 HA was closely related to systemic infection and impaired immune response.17,18 Therefore, we selected H5N1 HA gene as the RNAi targets. Four amiRNAs which scored highest according to online RNAi designer (http://rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com/rnaiexpress/) were generated as described in the Materials and Methods, including HA-300, HA-903, HA-1229, and HA-1405. The pre-amiRNA sequences were displayed in Table 1. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of the amiRNA constructs, we transfected the aforementioned amiRNA plasmids (1 \u03bcg) separately into HEK 293T cells 24 hours before influenza challenge. Transduced cells were infected with 0.0005 MOI H5N1 and lysed with Trizol for RNA isolation 24 hours later. Neg-miRNA control plasmid-treated cells were used as mock controls, and its flu gene expression level was set at 100%. As depicted in Figure 1, all amiRNA treatments significantly lowered H5N1 viral production compared to corresponding controls (P < 0.01). Among four amiRNAs, HA-1405 exhibited strongest inhibition on clade 2.3.2 (mean viral load 3.30%) and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 (mean viral load 11.10%). Its mean suppression on clade 9 was 41.17%, only next to HA-903 (mean viral load 24.53%), while the latter one was less efficient against other three H5N1 clades. As to clade 7, all four amiRNAs showed similar effect (HA-300, 27.63%; HA-903, 25.20%; HA-1229, 33.00%; and HA-1405, 35.57%).

Our previous data proved that adenovirus vector was one of the ideal candidates considering its tissue tropism and safety.8,10 Here, we inserted the whole amiRNA (HA-1405) expression cassette into the E1 region of AdC68 and rescued the recombinant adenovirus, termed as rAd(HA-1405). To examine whether rAd(HA-1405) could suppress H5N1 growth in vitro, we performed HA-targeting western blot in Vero cells and plaque reduction assay in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Figure 2). The expression of HA was significantly reduced in rAd(HA-1405) transduced Vero cells when infected with either clade of H5N1 virus. The inhibition efficiency exhibited a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2a). It is noteworthy that HA expression in clade 2.3.2-infecting cells was nearly abolished in presence of 1010 virus particle (vp) of rAd(HA-1405). Furthermore, the inhibition in influenza plaque formation was assessed in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 2b\u2013e, the numbers of plaques were all significantly lowered in the presence of 1010 vp of rAd(HA-1405) against four clades of H5N1 challenge compared to corresponding controls (clade 2.3.2, P = 0.0024; clade 2.3.4, P = 0.0031; clade 7, P = 0.0060; and clade 9, P = 0.0023). Pretreatment of 109 vp rAd(HA-1405) slightly decreased the average plaque formation of four H5N1 strains, but no significant difference was detected comparing to corresponding controls (clade 2.3.2, P = 0.1928; clade 2.3.4, P = 0.2124; clade 7, P = 0.0502; and clade 9, P = 0.0951). Among four clades, rAd(HA-1405) displayed strongest inhibitory activity against clade 2.3.2 by around fivefold (mean plaque count, 1010 vp of rAd(HA-1405) = 10.7, 1010 vp of rAd-empty = 53.3; Figure 2b), while suppression of other clades ranged from twofold to threefold (Figure 2c\u2013e). The inhibition efficiency of adenovirus-expressed amiRNA was not totally correlated with plasmid screen results (Figure 1). We assumed that difference in cell types, infection doses, and detection sensitivity might lead to this divergence.",

Five mice from each group were euthanized for lung viral RNA titration and histological scoring 5 days post infection (dpi). Clinical symptoms of rest 10 mice were monitored on a daily basis for 21 days. Figure 3 described the protection efficiency against clade 2.3.2 H5N1. The mean lung viral copies of rAd(HA-1405)-inoculated mice was 35-fold lower in comparison with rAd-empty group (P = 0.0280; Figure 3a). Hematoxylin and eosin staining proved that lung sections from control mice displayed severe perivascular and interstitial infiltrates (mean histological score = 4.6), while no pathology or small-area perivascular infiltrates was observed in rAd(HA-1405) group (mean histological score 1.4; P < 0.0001; Figure 3b,c). Furthermore, consistent with reduced viral titer and less pronounced inflammation responses, rAd(HA-1405) protected 70% ICR mice from lethal infection of clade 2.3.2 (P = 0.0031; Figure 3d). The survived mice in rAd(HA-1405) group lost at most 5% of initial weight around day4 to day 8 and gradually recovered (Figure 3e). In contrast, control mice suffered constant weight loss and all died or required euthanasia by day 9. Thus, rAd(HA-1405) conferred significant protection against clade 2.3.2 H5N1 challenge.",

Through in vitro screen, one amiRNA, HA-1405, was incorporated into AdC68 genome and extended to in vivo protection experiments. As shown in Figure 3, rAd(HA-1405) remarkably enhanced mice survival by 70% in face of clade 2.3.2 H5N1 challenge.

After being digested with I-CeuI and PI-SceI, the fragment was subcloned into the E1 region of the chimpanzee-origin adenovirus molecular clone (AdC68). The constructs were verified by enzyme digestion and sequencing. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated by transfecting PacI linearized plasmids into HEK 293 cells. Rescued Ads were further expended in HEK 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation. Virus concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at absorbance of 260 nm. rAd-empty was constructed by the same strategy, which was applied as the mock control virus in following studies.",
