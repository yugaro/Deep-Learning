An expeditious diagnosis that distinguishes IMHA from other causes of anemia is critical to the rapid institution of appropriate treatment. Various criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA have been described in the literature based on the documentation of immune\u2010mediated erythrolysis or proxy markers for this phenomenon,9, 10, 11, 12 but little consensus exists on which criteria are required for definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, the differentiation of spontaneous IMHA from disease associated with putative trigger factors is an important first step in the diagnostic evaluation, because removal of trigger factors whenever possible is a crucial component of treatment. However, no guidelines exist for the diagnostic assessment of trigger factors, and formal assessment of the evidence for their implication in IMHA is lacking. An evidence summary would allow clinicians to better gauge the likelihood of a given comorbidity being implicated in the pathogenesis of IMHA, and would help to guide on which diagnostic tests should be performed in individual patients.",

A further 67 duplicate papers were excluded, yielding 181 unique papers. Of these, an additional 118 papers were excluded because they did not include information on patients with potential trigger factors. Of the remaining 63 papers, 52 contained information of relevance to infectious disease, including 14 genera of microbes infecting dogs and 8 genera of microbes infecting cats. A pathogen\u2010specific search on the basis of these genera yielded 11 additional papers meeting inclusion criteria. A search performed in March 2018, using both A1 and the pathogen\u2010specific algorithms, yielded another 6 papers. An important paper published before the advent of online archiving was added to the list. Data therefore were extracted from 81 papers (Figure 1).",

If >1 comorbidity was present in individual patients, including those infected with >1 agent, an IME value was not calculated. Reference to the patients nevertheless was made in the narrative if they yielded insight. Score D was assessed after positing the question: Does the study ask whether a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA as part of its hypothesis or specific aims, or is the question that a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA answered by study design? If the answer was yes, a D score was assigned; if the answer was no, the study was designated \u201cDescriptive Association Only\u201d for that comorbidity and assigned an arbitrary D score of 1 (the lowest possible) out of a maximum of 7. A Q score was not computed for comorbidities assigned Descriptive Association Only, because general study quality in those cases was irrelevant to the question of the causal relationship between comorbidity and IMHA; Q scores in those cases were therefore 0. The maximum normalized score for each criterion was 1, yielding a maximum IME value of 8 and a minimum of <1. An IME value of 0 was applied when a study presented evidence against a comorbidity being associated with IMHA. For each comorbidity within a paper, the most conservative score for each of the IME criteria was applied for the relevant cohort of patients, to avoid exaggeration of evidence.",

For example, 1 study found that the majority of anemic B. vogeli\u2010infected dogs had IgM and IgG bound to erythrocytes, but these antibodies were not detected in dogs infected with B. canis.57 In this study, eccentrocytosis, suggesting oxidative damage, was more common in B. canis\u2010infected dogs.

This clarification is needed because the word \u201cprimary\u201d implies that all triggers have been definitively ruled out, whereas \u201csecondary\u201d implies causation. We propose that the term \u201cassociative\u201d be used when a comorbidity is identified. In some cases, the comorbidity might have caused the IMHA (secondary IMHA), whereas in others it might be coincidental (primary IMHA). \u201cNon\u2010associative\u201d IMHA cases are those in which comorbidities are not identified in the diagnostic evaluation, and include primary (\u201cidiopathic\u201d) and cryptogenic cases. The latter implies that an underlying cause was not identified, perhaps because the underlying pathomechanisms are not currently understood, or the comorbidity could not be detected using available testing.",

However, it quickly became apparent that very few studies in the veterinary literature were designed to determine if a given comorbidity causes IMHA, hence an expanded approach was used to evaluate the evidence presented in our review. There is a critical need for well\u2010designed, prospective, case\u2010controlled clinical studies that directly ask the question of whether infections, neoplasia, drugs, and vaccines cause IMHA. Some comorbidities are likely to cause IMHA in a large number of affected patients, such as an infection that expresses an epitope mimicking an erythrocyte antigen widely expressed in a population, or an organism that causes transient expression of normally hidden epitopes. Others might induce IMHA only in patients with epigenetic and genetic predisposition, or a given inflammatory context. Studies that investigate how individual comorbidities trigger IMHA, and the role of genetics and epigenetics, will help identify what diseases to screen for in all patients, and what diseases to screen for in selected patients that may be at increased risk of developing IMHA from any trigger. Mechanistic studies also will determine which comorbidities, when treated, will lead to resolution of IMHA without the need for immunosuppression. Stringent criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA and definitive diagnosis of a comorbidity must be integrated into study design in order to make meaningful observations.",
