The Chinese government expanded the DOTS strategy nationwide with its free treatment policy to also cover active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 2000 and smear-negative PTB in 2005 (before 2000, free treatment were provided only for smear-positive patients).[5] Moreover, after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government increased public-health funding, revised laws on TB control, introduced internet-based disease reporting system, and rebuilt local public-health facilities to accelerate the performance of TB control programs.[6\u20138] With those strategies, a 48% reduction in bacteriologically positive TB and a 65% reduction in smear-positive TB were achieved between 1990 and 2010, dramatically contributing to the realization of the stop TB strategy.[4,5,9,10] However, China still ranks second among the 30 high TB-burden countries and has the world's largest number of patients with multidrug-resistant.[1] TB remains an ongoing intractable health challenge in China.",

Last, because only 1 province on the eastern coast of China was examined, the economic and regional disparities limited the generalizability of the results.[28]",
