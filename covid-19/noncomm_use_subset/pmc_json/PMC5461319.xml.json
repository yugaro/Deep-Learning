            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile, systemic vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology that occurs primarily in children younger than 5 years of age. The standard treatment of acute KD is a combination of high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg/day). The acute phase of KD involves platelet activation, and antiplatelet therapy is included in the treatment protocol for this phase (1). The finding of low levels of antithrombin III and depletion of the fibrinolytic system supports the concept that active intravascular clot formation and degradation occur in these patients and are most notable early in the acute phase of the disease (2). Thrombosis mainly occurs in the artery and is associated with platelet activation in KD (3). Following the cessation of fever for 2 to 3 days and improvement of all acute symptoms, the dosage of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can be reduced to the minimum level necessary to inhibit platelet aggregation.",

Platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs) have recently been reported as a platelet activation marker. Therefore, the PDMP levels can be used as an index of platelet activation (56). PDMPs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles generated from the plasma membrane upon platelet activation by various stimuli. An increase in the total numbers of PDMPs is associated with disease states such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension (7). However, little is known about these microparticles being linked to platelet dynamics in patients with KD. The purpose of this study was to prove that a state of platelet activation exists in patients with KD from the acute stage to the convalescent phase and to demonstrate the usefulness of the PDMP levels in evaluating the effect of antiplatelet therapy in KD.",

Taki et al. (16) reported that enhanced platelet aggregation was noted at a high frequency before treatment of KD by using the particle counting method. They suggested that platelet activation continues during the second stage (i.e., from the start of IVIG therapy to 20 days), but platelet activation is inhibited by antiplatelet agents. A recent study demonstrated that IVIG treatment significantly decreased PDMP levels in 18 patients with acute KD (17). They showed that the PDMP levels both immediately and 10\u201314 days after IVIG treatment were significantly lower than the pre-IVIG level. In contrast, we could find significant increase in PDMP level 2\u20135 days after IVIG treatment compared with the pre-IVIG level. We speculate that this difference was probably due to differences across ELISA kits used in this study and the timing of changes in ASA dosage. In the above-mentioned reports, they immediately changed the dose of ASA from an anti-inflammatory dose (30\u201350 mg/kg/day) to an anti-thrombotic dose (5 mg/kg/day) when the patients became afebrile. However, we maintained a high dose of ASA (50 mg/kg/day) until the patient had been afebrile for 2 to 3 days and all acute symptoms were improving. The ELISA test depends on the quality of reagents, usually antibodies. In addition, the possible interference of soluble antigens may result in underestimation of microparticle levels by antigenic capture.",
