Since HSV infection can be treated effectively with acyclovir, it is critical to rapidly and accurately establish the diagnosis and initiate treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is insensitive for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis, so brain biopsy, a very invasive procedure with significant morbidity, was historically required to make a diagnosis, with results not available for days afterward. Several studies demonstrated that detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using CSF samples performed equivalently to brain biopsy, including a landmark study in 1995.7-9 Given the ease of collecting CSF samples, the lower risk of complication, the lower cost, and speed of results, PCR became the standard of care for diagnosing HSV CNS infections in the mid-1990s, with LDPs used for nearly 20 years. It was not until 2014 that the first FDA-cleared PCR test for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis became available, with a second test cleared in 2015. Laboratory-developed testing procedures dramatically improved the quality of care for many patients and continue to be used successfully today, as the 2 cleared tests have limitations, requiring specific instrumentation not standard in many laboratories. Additionally, one of the tests is highly multiplexed, which may not be appropriate in all clinical situations.",

The infection is acquired by exposure to maternal genital secretions. The presentation of neonatal HSV varies and includes skin, eye, and mouth infection, with encephalitis and disseminated disease in over 50% of cases. Again, rapid diagnosis is needed to prevent morbidity and sequelae from encephalitis. The diagnosis of encephalitis is made via PCR of CSF samples, while testing of plasma or serum is critical to diagnose disseminated disease. The ability to use plasma or serum is very important as it may be difficult to obtain enough CSF from a newborn to assess all diagnoses in the differential. Although there are 2 FDA-cleared assays to test CSF for HSV, there are no assays cleared for testing serum and plasma. Laboratory-developed testing procedures continue to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of disseminated HSV infection in newborns.",

            "text": "BK virus infection is very common, with a seroprevalence in the adult population of \u223c90%. After primary infection, the virus colonizes the renal and urinary tracts; healthy individuals will occasionally shed virus in their urine without consequence. However, in renal transplant recipients, BK virus is the major cause of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), putting 1% to 15% of kidney transplant patients at risk of premature allograft failure.11 Given the lack of effective antiviral therapy for BK virus, the key to preventing allograft loss is to identify at-risk renal transplant recipients early and reduce immunosuppressive therapy before PVAN develops. Reduction of immunosuppressive therapy helps control viral replication and in most cases prevents the development of PVAN.12 There is a critical balance between too much immunosuppressive therapy, which can lead to PVAN, and too little immunosuppression causing rejection. The ability to monitor BK virus levels in the blood allows for informed clinical decisions. Studies have shown that monitoring patients with viral load testing during the first 2 years after transplant can dramatically reduce the development of PVAN. Consensus guidelines recommend that screening for BK replication be performed at least every 3 months during the first 2 years posttransplant and then annually until the fifth year posttransplant.13 When the plasma viral load value rises above a threshold (10 000 to 50 000 copies/mL), a renal biopsy may be performed to assess for PVAN, and immunosuppressive therapy is reduced based on the results of the biopsy. Viral load testing is also done if there is an increase in serum creatinine, as the level of BK virus aids in distinguishing rejection from PVAN.",

            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause a wide range of complications among both solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, as well as in other immunocompromised patients. Cytomegalovirus has a high seroprevalence, and large numbers of transplant patients experience reactivation or primary infection, with probability increasing based on pre-transplant serostatus, severity of pretransplant conditioning, and allograft relatedness.14,15 Although infection can be subclinical, high or increasing viral load signals increased the risk of symptomatic disease, which can range from relatively mild constitutional symptoms to severe end-organ infection or potentially fatal disseminated disease. Preemptive therapy of high-risk patients based on the detection of increasing CMV load in peripheral blood was shown to be effective in the 1990s16,17; however, the first FDA-approved IVD test did not appear on the market until 2012.18 In the intervening years, laboratory-developed assays played a critical role in bridging the gap. The presence of such methods and their adoption across the country enabled the routine use of CMV screening for asymptomatic patients in transplant centers soon after data supported its utility. The availability of such methods has likely saved many lives over the years, supporting early diagnosis, preemptive treatment strategies, and the assessment of therapeutic treatment efficacy.14,18-20 The widespread use of LDP CMV quantitative methods produced a generation of transplant physicians comfortable with the use of such methods and changed the epidemiology of posttransplant CMV disease, markedly reducing the incidence of early disease in such patients. Over the years of LDP use, numerous studies focused on continuous improvement and optimization of methods,21 including the development of international quantitative standards in 2010.22 The ability to rapidly incorporate advances in technology (including the advent of real-time quantitative methods) has been demonstrated by the improvement in sensitivity and other performance characteristics of such tests over time. The data accumulated throughout these experiences informed the development of the first commercially available CMV IVD assays. In fact, the absence of LDPs and the vast clinical and laboratory experience that they provided likely would have delayed the availability of commercial methods, and their performance characteristics taken longer to optimize to today\u2019s levels.",

Human papilloma virus\u2013positive head and neck cancer is biologically distinct from HPV-negative disease. Patients with HPV-driven tumors have a significantly better prognosis, including response to chemoradiation therapy and overall survival, compared to HPV-negative patients.32 Therefore, testing head and neck cancer specimens for high-risk HPV genotypes has become standard of care and is used to guide treatment.33,34 However, the HPV tests that are FDA approved for cervical specimens have not been approved for head and neck cancer, leaving a critical gap for patient care. Clinical laboratories have thus had to develop new assays or modified the existing FDA-approved ones to detect high-risk HPV genotypes in head and neck cancer specimens. Inclusion of patients in several clinical trials is based on these LDPs (www.clinicaltrials.gov. Accessed April 27, 2017). Without laboratory-developed tests, patients with head and neck cancer cannot benefit from personalized treatment strategies.",

In response, many clinical laboratories developed, validated, and implemented the LDPs needed to care for patients at their institutions.37,38 These assays were based on extensive data sets and reported in peer-reviewed journals, supporting their quality claims. Since performance characteristics such as analytic sensitivity (limit of detection) may vary between different assay designs,39 as was recently discussed for several different Zika virus tests,40 these sorts of collaborative efforts are essential. In many cases, laboratories leading these efforts collaborated with one another to share validation materials, perform interlaboratory comparisons, and exchange blinded testing samples (http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/23/texas-hospitals-develop-rapid-zika-test/80776382/.

When the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared Zika virus to be a public health emergency, the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Zika virus testing was granted to a test available only to the public health laboratory system, not to hospital laboratories on the front lines of patient care (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/28/2016-06888/authorization-of-emergency-use-of-an-in-vitro-diagnostic-device-for-diagnosis-of-zika-virus. Accessed April 27, 2017). As a result, the public health system quickly became overwhelmed, as it has been during past outbreaks, such as influenza.42 In many areas, turnaround times for Zika virus testing exceeded 4 to 8 weeks (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/us/zika-test-delays-florida-pregnant.html?_r=0. Accessed April 27, 2017, http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-lab-constraints-zika-results.html. Accessed April 27, 2017, http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article104856631.html. Accessed April 27, 2017). These delays critically impact patient care, particularly for pregnant women with possibly affected fetuses. In comparison, many hospital-based and national reference laboratories are able to report results within hours (http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/23/texas-hospitals-develop-rapid-zika-test/80776382/.

For example, in Miami-Dade Florida, where more than 1000 people have been confirmed Zika positive and the virus is circulating in the local mosquito population, the public health laboratory system encountered a backlog of nearly 1000 untested specimens (http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article104856631.html. Accessed April 27, 2017). Diagnostic assays for Zika and other emerging pathogens will continue to evolve,43 but it is clear that rapid identification of pathogens during other outbreaks facilitates rapid treatment and appropriate isolation of patients, leading to improved patient outcomes and potentially slowing the spread of infections such as influenza (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm. Accessed April 27, 2017). Implementation of the first rapid diagnostic tests for influenza was directly associated with reduced length of hospital stay, decreased mortality, and reduced costs.44 Access to diagnostic tests, early in the course of an outbreak and in hospital laboratories, has a positive public health impact.",

Each test can be designed to detect hotspots of known mutations in those genes, to sequence the entire coding region of the genes, or to sequence the entire gene. The end result is a comprehensive profile of the tumor genome that can then be used to tailor therapy for the individual patient. Although NGS assays cost more than single-gene assays, the cost per gene sequence is dramatically reduced and results in cost savings over using multiple single-gene tests. Furthermore, NGS panels can be applied to very small specimen samples, using as little as 10 to 250 ng of input DNA depending on the analytic platform utilized. Since evaluation of therapeutic biomarkers is usually needed in the setting of advanced disease and such patients often have only limited tissue samples available for testing, NGS assays allow for much more extensive genomic information to be obtained compared to single-gene assays, each of which can require DNA input comparable to that of an entire NGS panel.",

In those very early days of targeted therapy, long before the advent of FDA-approved \u201ccompanion diagnostics,\u201d the ubiquitous and obvious method to determine the efficacy of novel leukemia treatments was to directly quantitate the target of the inhibitor drug, namely, the cancer cell\u2013specific BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. A reduction in posttreatment BCR-ABL1 RNA levels, as measured by sensitive laboratory-developed PCR-based methods, was shown to be the best available test for predicting therapeutic response and long-term progression-free survival in TKI-treated patients with CML.89 Consensus oncology practice guidelines in both the United States (NCCN)90 and Europe (ELN),91 going back at least a decade, have universally recommended that TKI-treated patients with CML should be serially monitored with a (laboratory-developed) BCR-ABL1 RT-PCR blood test at least every 3 to 6 months during their lifelong course of TKI therapy. The NCCN and ELN guidelines have also long recommended serial BCR-ABL1 RNA testing to directly inform not only the appropriate dose of TKI (to overcome developing resistance) but also the therapeutic switch from one TKI to another (depending on the drug\u2019s known resistance profile).",

Many laboratories began offering sequence-based testing for heritable disorders in the 1990s, using a variety of mutation-scanning techniques, such as single-strand conformation polymorphism, denaturing HPLC, MLPA, and others.102 Sanger-based sequencing was the gold standard, despite being slow and expensive. The multigenic nature of some of these disorders made these sequencing approaches challenging due to the sheer number of genes and size of the sequence requiring analysis. In recent years, however, most of this testing has been converted to NGS, which offers significant advantages in terms of analytic capabilities, quality, speed, and cost.103 The repetitive sequence reads in a single region ensure an enhanced level of quality, and NGS assays can be designed to interrogate anything from small to large gene panels, whole exomes, and beyond, depending on the clinical need being addressed. Consensus guidelines for NGS assays have been developed by multiple professional societies and address the development, validation, and quality control of these assays.104,105 The CAP has developed inspection checklists for laboratories performing NGS for detection of somatic mutations in cancers as well as germline mutations that cause heritable diseases. Progress has also been made in the planning and production of reference materials and proficiency samples.106 Together, these practices and resources have yielded laboratory-developed assays that can be demonstrated to meet the quality levels needed for patient care.",

Accessed November 4, 2016). Knowledge of the specific gene can direct therapy and provide reproductive options for the family. For many years, it was possible only to sequence the suspect genes one by one, taking months to years, and only on a research basis. Recently, with the advent of NGS technology, a small number of clinical laboratories have stepped in to develop a rapid multigene NGS approach that provides answers quickly in time to make treatment decisions as well as to provide carrier and prenatal testing in at-risk families.131,132 As new candidate genes have been identified, NGS has been validated and offered for clinical testing.",

Emerging resistance among pathogenic bacteria and new antimicrobial agents require frequent updates to both testing methods and interpretation of the results. Most laboratories use automated instruments to perform minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing to determine whether a patient\u2019s isolated bacteria are susceptible, susceptible dose dependent, intermediate, or resistant to a panel of antibiotics. These interpretations are based on FDA breakpoint criteria published at the time of drug approval and periodically updated to respond to the appearance of new resistance mechanisms.169 The FDA also clears automated instrumentation used to determine MIC values (via the 510k process).170 Although the MIC testing process may not be changed, new breakpoints added to the instrument software require a revised 510k application. Because the FDA does not have the authority to require manufacturers to submit data for revised breakpoints within a specified time frame, manufacturers may elect to use outdated breakpoints rather than face the expense of a 510K resubmission. A recent example was the 3-year delay between the release of updated breakpoints for diagnosing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in 2010 and the ability to use these breakpoints in the clinical laboratory. This delay was used to calculate the potential for additional carriers of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Southern California health-care systems. As many as 1821 additional carriers of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae were estimated to have occurred in Orange County, California because of this delay.171 The disastrous spread of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae can be mitigated by laboratories validating testing methods that enable use of updated antimicrobial breakpoint interpretations before FDA-cleared testing is available. Specifically, modifying a manufacturer\u2019s instructions, including interpreting MIC results using a revised breakpoint other than that listed in the product insert, is a change that renders the procedure an LDP. Without the option of using an LDP, one is left reporting outdated interpretations that miss resistant strains leading to unacceptable patient care.",

This Quality Pilot emerged from the Sustainable Predictive Oncology Therapeutics and Diagnostics working group, launched in 2013 by Tapestry Networks (Waltham, Massachusetts), which was composed of diverse stakeholders (oncologists, pathologists, patient advocates, third party payers, and regulators) for the purpose of designing a quality pilot to advance these goals (http://www.tapestrynetworks.com/initiatives/healthcare/oncology-therapeutics-and-diagnostics/diagnostic-quality-assurance-pilot.cfm. Accessed April 27, 2017).176 The Tapestry pilot proposes that laboratories would be allowed to utilize assays that best serve the needs of their patients based upon performance, quality, clinical needs, and the test menus and volumes of that particular laboratory. It is not critical that laboratories all use the identical assay or test platform, provided that all are able to get the correct answer.",
