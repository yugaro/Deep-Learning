Furthermore, 1,4-dioxane may also be toxic to liver, lungs, kidneys, and the central nervous system [25]. 1,4-dioxane was defined as a Class 2 solvent associated with less severe toxicity, which should be limited to below 380 ppm according to international regulations, such as Chinese Pharmacopoeia [26], International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [27], and United States Pharmacopoeia [28].

The method was validated and applied to optimise the drying process of scaffolds during fabrication that could also be generalised as standard and/or guideline for wide applications.",

According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia [26], International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [27], and United States Pharmacopoeia [28], 1,4-dioxane in the products should be no more than 380 ppm. We convert the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in 0.3 g scaffold (i.e. 380 ppm) into the concentration in 4 mL DMF according to the following formula: 380 ppm \u00d7 weight of the scaffold (0.3 g)/the weight of DMF = 380 ppm \u00d7 0.3g/(volume \u00d7 density) of DMF= 380 ppm \u00d7 0.3g/(4 mL \u00d7 0.9487 g/L) = 30 ppm. This means the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in 0.3 g scaffold in 4 mL DMF should be less than 30 ppm. So, 20 ppm, 25 ppm, and 30 ppm of 1,4-dioxane standard solutions were prepared with matrix blank scaffolds in DMF; triplicate samples of each concentration were prepared.

Interday precision was calculated to describe intermediate precision of retention time and peak area, which were 0.02% and 0.62% (n = 12), respectively (Table S2). The linear range for 1,4-dioxane was determined as 1\u201340 ppm. The calibration curves were linear for all the standard components with correlation coefficient \u22650.9999. LOD and LQD for 1,4-dioxane were 1 ppb and 5 ppb, respectively. The results showed that the resolution, tailing factor, and the number of theoretical plates when the column was changed to DB-624 met the system suitability requirements. %RSD of six samples was 1.6% between Hp-5ms and DB-624 (Table S3), implying that the area of target peak had little changes. All of the results met the requirement of the guideline 9101 described in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition [26] (Table 2).",

Four solutions were used; as a result, the detected amount of 1,4-dioxane was exactly inversely related to its solubility in different solution, and Na2CO3 solution showed the highest sensitivity due to the salting-out effect [32]. However, as the first method to test the gas from a solid porous structure, we further investigated the matrix effects of the different solutions. There were two different extraction systems, one in Na2CO3 solution, retaining the porous structure of the scaffolds, and the other in DMF solution without any porous structures. In DMF solution, the scaffolds were dissolved into powders, and 1,4-dioxane was distributed in solution phase and gas phase. The detected amount was determined by its solubility in DMF, so the detected amount of 1,4-dioxane were the same in DMF with or without matrix blank scaffolds. In Na2CO3 solution with the matrix blank scaffold, 1,4-dioxane was distributed in three phases: scaffold, solution, and gas, and the detected amount was determined not only the solubility in Na2CO3 but also the attachment in the porous scaffolds. Thus, the detected amount of 1,4-dioxane in Na2CO3 solution only was more than that in the Na2CO3 solution with matrix blank scaffolds (Figure 2C). The fabricated porous scaffolds had both regular macropores, with the size among 300 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, as well as irregular micropores with size from 5 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm pores (Figure 1B\u20131F) [11], [13], which might be the cause of matrix effects. Thus, we selected DMF to extract 1,4-dioxane from the scaffolds as the pretreatment process of the GC-MS methods. The following method's validation results further confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.",

After examining the three-phase diagram of 1,4-dioxane, we found that the conditions of \u221250\u00b0C and 50 Pa for lyophilising are not efficient for removing 1,4-dioxane (Figure S1) because in this environment 1,4-dioxane prefers solid rather than gas; therefore, we will further optimise the drying process by lowering the pressure or increasing the temperature to improve the freeze-dry efficiency. Our newly established quantitative method will also be used to verify this hypothesis.",
