The first antibiotic was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, called penicillin and saved the lives of millions of people. However, the discovery of penicillin as a modern medication was preceded by the management of microbial infections in Egypt, Greece and ancient China [1]. Shortly after the discovery of penicillin, the bacterial resistance to this antibiotic became one of the challenges in the treatment of bacterial infections. Therefore, new generation of beta-lactam antibiotics was developed to overcome antibiotic resistance and to treat bacterial infections. However, the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported in England in 1962 [2,3]. The production and discovery of new antibiotics continue to this day and new antibiotics are marketed to counteract the drug resistance problem. Yet, the point should be raised that one day antibiotics can no longer affect bacteria and will no longer be able to control bacterial infections. Consequently, in recent years, researchers have devised other means to treat bacterial infections. One of such approaches is the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or \u201cpeptide antibiotics\u201d to kill pathogenic bacteria and to treat bacterial infections [4]. Over the past decades, antimicrobial peptides (peptide antibiotics) have been shown to be effective in innate immunity of various species, such as plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.",

The cathelicidin family is important antimicrobial agents in mammals [5, 6]. These peptides are mainly stored in lysosomes of macrophages (MQ) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) [7]. Cathelicidins have been isolated from many cell types including neutrophils to coordinate the immune system, but have been found in other immune cells such as epithelial cells and macrophages and have been shown to combat against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Cathelicidins have a variety of sizes (12\u201380 amino acids) and also have a wide range of structures [8]. The molecular mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been investigated [9]. Stem cells have been the focus of research because they have shown good potential in the field of therapy [10]. One of the features of the stem cells referred to in this review is antimicrobial activity of mesenchymal stem cells that perform this action through antimicrobial peptides such as ll-37, Hepcidin and \u03b2-Defensin-2 [11]. The purpose of this study is to briefly review mesenchymal stem cells and antimicrobial peptides and how these peptides function.",

MSCs have been obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord, blood, placenta, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Recent studies have found that MSCs play an important role in the treatment of diseases, including infections, by producing antimicrobial peptides [12, 13, 14].",

The helical structure of this peptide was investigated in a saline environment containing vitamin E upon synthesis and antibacterial activity was investigated [9]. The peptide is specifically secreted in the secondary granules of neutrophils. It is also produced by many types of cells, including macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, epithelial cells of the skin, airways, eyes and intestinal tract.

This peptide was discovered in 2000 and was called LEAP 1, but after a while due to presence in the liver, the peptide was named \u201chepcidin\u201d. This peptide is effective on a wide range of fungi, bacteria and viruses. One of the most important effects of hepcidin in the body is the regulation of iron hemostasis. This peptide prevents iron absorption from the small intestine and releases iron from reticuloendothelial cells. In infectious diseases, macrophages and bacteria compete to absorb iron [37]. Macrophages interfere with the absorption of iron by bacteria. Eventually, the pathogen does not grow and replenish. Factors that cause hepcidin production are increased in bone marrow and anemia. Other factors that increase the production of hepcidin are iron accumulation and inflammation [38].",

Secondly, the peptidoglycan layer is thick in Gram-positive bacteria and the formation of pores by defensin on the surface of the Gram-positive cells requires more time.
