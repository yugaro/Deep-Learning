However, high levels of inter-laboratory variation are observed, as a result of which protective antibody levels are ill-defined, ranging from titres of 8 to 128 (Mumford and Wood, 1992). For equine influenza, the requirement to treat the virus with Tween 80 and ether to improve the sensitivity of the assay (John and Fulgitini, 1966) further increases variability of the assay. The HI test only measures inhibition of HA binding to cells (HA globular head reactive antibodies).",

A number of avian and human influenza virus subtypes have been pseudotyped and used in such serological assays (Temperton et al, 2007; Temperton and Wright, 2009; Corti et al, 2011; Garcia and Lai, 2011). A pseudotype virus has the \u2018core\u2019 of one virus (e.g., a retrovirus) and the outer \u2018envelope\u2019 protein of another (e.g., the HA of influenza virus). The core virus has deletions in the genome making it replication-deficient, and harbours a reporter transgene (e.g., luciferase). The envelope glycoprotein permits entry into susceptible target cells. During cell transduction, the pseudotype virus (PV) genome becomes integrated in the cell genome and expresses the reporter gene. Thus the number of transduced cells can be quantified and the subsequent inhibitory effects of antibodies in serum on PV entry determined (Temperton et al, 2007; Temperton and Wright, 2009; Garcia and Lai, 2011).",

Next, 1\u00d7104 cells were added to each well, incubated for 48 hrs, and their luminescence read as described above. Test sample results were normalised by deducting any background luminescence produced by cell-only controls (no pseudotype virus). Additionally, the no-serum control (cells plus viruses) was included (equivalent to 0% neutralization). IC50 antibody titres (the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50% inhibition of pseudotype virus entry) were calculated using GraphPad Prism computer software. Values <80 were considered negative (Katz et al, 1999; Garcia and Lai, 2011). Average values of two independent experiments are shown here.",

The HA1 mediates binding to the sialic acid receptor, while HA2 is involved in membrane fusion. A number of proteases have been implicated in this cleavage process. The HA0 of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes (e.g., A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1)) have a polybasic cleavage site containing multiple arginine and lysine residues that are cleaved by ubiquitous subtilisin-like endoproteases such as furin (reviewed in Steinhauer, 1999). All other influenza A viruses, including low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses, seasonal human influenza and H3 equine influenza viruses, have monobasic cleavage sites with a single lysine or arginine residue (Figure 2). It has been shown that cleavage at these sites is mediated by specific type II transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and HAT (human airway trypsin-like protease) found in human airways (B\u00f6ttcher et al, 2006; 2009). Consequently, we included a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 protease in the transfection procedure to mediate cleavage of the monobasic cleavage site in the equine pseudotype virus. By this approach, a high titre EIPV was successfully generated.",

Though antibodies detected by SRH are largely neutralizing (Morley et al, 1995), there are differences between SRH and neutralization assays such as PVNA and micro-neutralization (MN). For HA, SRH primarily detects responses resulting from antibody interactions with the head of the trimer (though it does detect other viral proteins), whereas both neutralization assays can also efficiently detect responses to the HA stalk (Corti et al, 2011). This may explain the two PVNA positive but SRH negative results. In a comparison of SRH, neutralization using swine embryo kidney (ESK) cells and HI tests using serum samples from horses that had received two doses of vaccine, Yamagishi et al (1982) found reasonable correlation between the assays. The correlation between the SRH assay and the neutralisation test was 75% (r = 0.75). This is comparable to the 65% correlation (r = 0.65) seen between SRH and PVNA in the present study. Yamagishi et al also found that the SRH assay was less sensitive than both the HI and neutralisation tests. Our data similarly indicates the slightly greater sensitivity of a neutralization assay using pseudotype viruses compared with SRH.",
