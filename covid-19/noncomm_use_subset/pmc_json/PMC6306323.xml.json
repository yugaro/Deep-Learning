Moreover, dialysis patients with ESRD are frequently exposed to the healthcare setting and are very susceptible to nosocomial infections, which might be a source of TB outbreaks.6 Transmission of infectious diseases, such as TB, has attracted considerable public attention in Korea since the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak during 2015, which involved a large number of suspected hospital-acquired infections.7",

Finally, these eligible patients, who started dialysis during 2004\u20132013 (dialysis cohort), were identified after excluding potentially pre-existing cases of dialysis or active TB. We identified individuals without ESRD from the KNHIS-NSC database (control cohort), who were propensity score matched to an equal number of ESRD cases. Propensity score matching using the nearest neighbour method was performed to identify similar individuals in the dialysis and control cohorts using the Matchlt package version 3.0.1 in R software (version 3.4.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Logistic regression was used to create propensity scores for each patient based on their age, gender, income level, and comorbidities. Individuals in both cohorts were randomly ordered and matched 1:1 using the nearest neighbour method. A matching algorithm identified a unique matched control for each individual in the dialysis cohort according to the propensity score. Once a match was completed, the match was not considered again. If a match could not be found, the algorithm then proceeded sequentially to an individual with the closest propensity score to make the next-best match. To improve generalisability and reduce potential bias caused by incomplete matching, we used a random selection of samples from the set of all subjects.10",

The incidence of active TB was expressed as the number of newly diagnosed active TB cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of ESRD, relative to the controls, was calculated with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using the epiR package version 0.9\u201396 in R software (version 3.5.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We applied a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to all independent variables after combining the two cohorts to determine the ESRD-related risk of developing active TB, which was reported as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. We evaluated the proportional hazard assumption by testing the significance of time-dependent interaction terms for all variables, which were found to be satisfactory. Cumulative TB incidence curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between two cohorts were analysed using the log-rank test. The follow-up period started on the first date of dialysis for the cases and on randomly selected visit dates for the controls, which corresponded to the calendar year that matched to the start of dialysis for the cases. The follow-up period ended at the first date of TB diagnosis or the last follow-up date.

For example, one nationwide cohort study from a country with a low incidence of TB11 included 14,506 patients receiving dialysis for ESRD, and revealed that the overall incidence of active TB was 66.8/100,000 person-years. A recent meta-analysis12 also estimated that dialysis was associated with a pooled unadjusted rate ratio of 7.69 (95% CI, 5.94\u20139.95). Although numerous studies have investigated the relationship between active TB and CKD, most of the previous studies were case reports, case-control studies, small hospital-based cohort studies, or regional registry studies.3 A recent Taiwanese study13 included 4,131 patients with new-onset ESRD and an age- and gender-matched control group, and revealed that ESRD was associated with a 2.40-fold higher risk of developing active TB. The present study also examined a large population-based sample of individuals who were receiving dialysis, and comparison to the matched control group revealed that there was a relationship between active TB and ESRD.",

            "text": "In addition to mortality and morbidity, several issues and burdens related to TB should be highlighted among patients with ESRD. For example, the clinical manifestation of active TB during dialysis is often insidious and atypical,14 as patients with ESRD and TB frequently present with systemic symptoms that are similar to uraemia, which can delay the diagnosis. Patients may also present with extra-pulmonary or disseminated diseases.15 Among patients with CKD, the standard anti-TB treatment involves quadruple therapy, although this is problematic because ethambutol and pyrazinamide are both cleared through the kidney and require renal-adjusted dosing. In addition, rifampicin often interacts with anti-hypertensive, antidiabetic, and immunosuppressive medications, which can necessitate dose adjustments.16 Furthermore, anti-TB medication causes more severe and frequent toxicities among patients with ESRD, including gastrointestinal troubles and decreased appetite, which limits the treatment regimen and duration.17 Screening for latent and active TB infections among patients with ESRD is another important issue for controlling TB. Although the World Health Organization recommends systemic testing for TB among patients who are receiving dialysis or transplantation, there is a paucity of evidence for guiding the screening recommendation, and optimal treatment for latent TB infection is unclear among patients with advanced CKD. Thus, there is a need for clear and consistent guidance to develop suitable protocols for screening, diagnosis, and treatment of TB among patient with CKD.",

            "text": "The present study has several limitations that should be considered. First, this study collected data that were based on diagnostic codes and insurance claims, which precluded analysis of information regarding other lifestyle and clinical variables that could influence risk of TB infection. We attempted to control for such confounding using other available data. For example, we included COPD to adjust for the effects of smoking, as COPD is mainly attributed to smoking.22 We also included household income, which represents various factors associated with socio-economic status. Those with a history of anti-TB treatment before study enrolment were excluded in order to minimise the effect of recent TB infection. Although use of immunosuppressant drugs is an important risk factor for active TB development, dialysis patients rarely use immunosuppressants in clinical practice, as dialysis also suppresses the patient's immune function.23 Thus, based on its limited use, we elected to omit immunosuppressant use as a co-variable. Second, dialysis patients might have more frequent visits to clinics and a higher likelihood of receiving appropriate screening (e.g., chest radiography), and would be more likely to seek medical attention if TB symptoms arose. Thus, ascertainment and detection biases might contribute to a higher rate of active TB identification in the dialysis cohort than in the control cohort. Nevertheless, Korea has a single national health insurance service that ensures citizens have easy and inexpensive access to medical care, and the National Health Screening Program provides regular chest radiography examinations for every healthy adult,24 which frequently leads to an early diagnosis of active TB. Thus, although there might be some delays in the control cohort's TB diagnosis, we suspect any underestimation of active TB identification in that cohort would be minimal. Third, the diagnosis of active TB was based on the ICD-10 codes and drug prescription history, which may be associated with limited sensitivity. Diagnosing TB with a specific combination of anti-TB drugs might not be accurate, because these drugs may be prescribed for other infectious diseases, such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria disease. A recent study25 showed that some patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease transiently received anti-TB treatment before its final diagnosis. However, this criterion has been used in various previous studies and meta-analyses. Because Korean law requires all active TB cases to be reported using the ICD-10 codes, we assumed the use of these codes to be a valid and reliable approach.",
