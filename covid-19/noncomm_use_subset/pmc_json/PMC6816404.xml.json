Little may be known about the basic virology or immunology of a new pathogen, though the need for developing vaccines and therapeutics is urgent.9 Some typical methods used as vaccine clinical assays are antibody-binding ELISAs, virus neutralization or bactericidal immunoassays, IFN\u03b3-ELISpot or related cellular immune methodology using the target antigen or antigen-derived peptide pools, and detection of the pathogen through molecular or culture assays. Vaccine clinical assays measuring humoral and cellular immune responses developed early in a program will likely evolve as clinical development progresses or as the scientific knowledge base of the pathogen and relevant immunology broadens. As improvements in technology occur over time, early vaccine assays are often re-designed and bridged to assays with higher throughput, multiplexed detection, reduction of sample volumes, and automation to support testing of large numbers of specimens for late-stage clinical trials.28\u201335 Often, a variety of tests are evaluated early in the program and, based on the usefulness of the data, a down-selection occurs so that the most relevant few remain to support large Phase 3 clinical trials and licensure of the vaccine.2,35,36",

Outside the US, the WHO\u2019s Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedures (EUALs) recognizes the need and can grant authorization for use of diagnostic kits in emergency situations.48 Although no MERS-CoV or ZIKV diagnostic kit, serological or viral, have been fully approved by the FDA to date, the FDA has worked collaboratively with developers to accelerate the approval process when outbreak conditions warrant.49 A number of published studies have evaluated EUA tests independently for relevant sensitivity and specificity performance or in comparative studies32,39,50\u201356 to aid in the selection of appropriate tests for the needs of epidemiological surveillance or public health diagnostics.
