Studies assessing the relationship between clinical symptoms and respiratory infections yielded conflicting results (5).

In the present study RSV was the most frequently demonstrated virus accounted for 16.8% of all viruses detected. Our results were similar to those from other countries (14,15) and emphasize the role of RSV as the leading cause of ARTI in infants and young children. Meanwhile RSV was mostly found in female infants less than one year of age with the typical seasonal pattern with a peak incidence during February (16). Fever, cough and myalgia were the common clinical signs and symptoms in these patients.

We detected 1 hMPV in 2 year old female child with RSV infection who had Kawasaki syndrome and hospitalized in the pediatric ward. Studies have reported high co-infection rates with these two viruses (24).Similar to the Catherine M. report, which showed hMPV distribution frequently in the winter months (25), we detected the only hMPV of this study on February. Fever and cough were the clinical signs and symptoms of this child. RTIs are common in young children, decrease in frequency with age, and predominate in boys (26,27). This age distribution was the same in the present study which demonstrated a higher incidence of RTI in children younger than 1 year old. There was male predominance in this study but it was not significant. The relative frequency of each viral agent and the pattern of occurrence were similar to those described in previous reports (28,29).It is difficult to formulate a single theory to explain the epidemiology of viral infections at different times of the year. The most appropriate theory may be that, by staying indoors in cold weather, families promote the spread of virus infections which rely on the droplet transmission within confined spaces (30).Susceptible children could acquire the virus from older children in whom manifestations of viral respiratory tract infections are mild (31).\n",

Viral co infections and recently discovered viruses are involved in a significant percentage of acute RVI. Studies are being conducted to determine whether dual respiratory virus infections carry an increased risk for adverse outcomes or increased hospital stays for pediatric patients. Better understanding of the epidemiology of RVI may be used for timely specific antiviral therapy, prophylactic and vaccination. This study described the demographic and clinical presentations of specific RVI in 202 children under the 6 years of age in Iran. Monitoring is necessary in a broader population and for a longer period of time in order to better delineate the clinical and epidemiological behavior of respiratory viruses in children. Although routine surveillance of respiratory viruses might not seem to be cost-effective, continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful means of planning the resources necessary for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.\n",
