All participating laboratories are using the same screening method of real-time PCR, and the laboratories in the network can process at least 2000 samples/d in case of a surge of samples. A total of 6,776 samples have been tested and 154 cases have been confirmed as MERS positive since May 19. We have also successfully isolated MERS-CoV from a clinical specimen of a MERS patient in Vero cell culture. The MERS-CoV was fully sequenced from the cell culture supernatant of the second confirmed case (the wife of the index case), which showed that the sequence of Korean MERS-CoV is highly similar to that of MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia (99.82% identity with Saudi Arabia isolates in 2013). Preliminary results of direct sequencing of the spike gene from additional clinical samples showed that the S gene sequences are similar to those of the MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia and China. Further studies of MERS-CoV include molecular epidemiological and virus evolution studies of more strains from this outbreak, correlation studies of the clinical features of patients and laboratory testing results (Cycle of threshold (CT) values), studies of the asymptomatic infection of MERS-CoV among health workers, and longitudinal sero-prevalence studies of MERS-CoV by serological testing [2,3].",
