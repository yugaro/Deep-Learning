Despite all this extensive screening, and in contrast to what was observed by our colleagues dealing with adult cases in the hospital, our pediatric department could identify only one case of MERS-CoV in a 9-month-old child known to have nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, out of 701 patients confirmed MERS-CoV reported, so far worldwide, only 14 were pediatric cases (2%).4 Does this mean that MERS-CoV is mainly an adult disease? Or alternatively, does MERS-CoV in children have a different clinical picture, including a less severe disease, or an atypical presentation, or even an asymptomatic carrier state? What are the risk factors, the comorbidities and the outcome? These questions are still unanswered in the pediatric literature. The 14 children with confirmed MERS-CoV have a mean age of 99 months, and they were 8 females and 6 males (Table 1). Nine patients were asymptomatic and were detected during screening of family contact; all these 9 patients were healthy without underlying diseases.5 Three patients developed mild respiratory symptoms,5-7 while the last 2 patients developed severe respiratory symptoms.5 These 2 patients have associated comorbidities. The outcome was good in 12 patients, while the 2 patients with severe respiratory symptoms and comorbidities developed multi-organs dysfunction and died (14.2%).",

This impression of low mortality in children with MERS-CoV was also reported during the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in children, where symptoms were milder, and resulted in no mortality, and few hospitalizations.9 The low incidence of MERS-CoV infection in children is corroborated by a Jordanian prospective year-round viral surveillance study in children less than 2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever from March to September 2010 tested for MERS-CoV, all 474 tested patients were negative.10 We were, unfortunately, unable to identify how our patient got infected.",

These data suggest that the recommended infection control measures are adequate to reduce the risk of transmission within healthcare facilities. During our investigations, we focused on the last 2 patterns of transmission, and we searched for any link between our patient and adult patients admitted during the same period with MERS-CoV in our hospital, however we failed to demonstrate any positive contacts.",
