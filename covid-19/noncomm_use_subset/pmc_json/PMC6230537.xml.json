Digital epidemiology has increased in the last decade due to the increasing availability of big data, and advancements in computing power and data analytics methods. The goal of epidemiology is to understand the distribution (who, when, where), and determinants of health and disease conditions in a defined population. Surveillance and descriptive studies can be performed to assess the distribution and analytical studies to identify determinants. The findings of epidemiological studies can be used to control disease and health problems.",

An explorative study investigates the full nature of the phenomenon, the manner in which it manifests, and other related factors through correlation analyses. An example of such a study is Chary et al. [18], which demonstrated a strong correlation between the geographic variation in social media posts mentioning prescription opioid misuse and government estimates of misuse of prescription opioids. An explanatory study focuses on understanding the underlying causes of a phenomenon or the systematic relationships among variables [13]. An example is Towers et al. [19], which examined whether news coverage was a significant factor in the temporal patterns of Ebola-related Twitter data using a linear regression model. A predictive and controlled study attempts to predict a phenomenon based on research findings. An example is Ram et al.

Digital epidemiological studies require large datasets and advanced analytics such as machine learning. Most machine learning algorithms are openly available due to the strong open source software movement. Thus, it is important to ensure that as much data as possible are openly accessible. As Salathe [2] elaborated so well in his review article, this is clearly at odds with the desire to have as little personal data as possible publicly accessible to protect individual privacy. There is no straightforward solution to this conflict of interest between open access to large data sets and privacy protection, but Salathe [2] proposed data cooperatives with restricted access as a solution.",

However, four authors independently reviewed each article and category of abstraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Second, there are no prior standards to follow for evaluating literature from novel digital data sources such as search engines, social media services, and mobile phones. Finally, there was the possibility of incomplete retrieval of articles on digital epidemiology using our search strategy. We reviewed the references sections of articles to capture as many articles as possible and performed an extensive search of the PubMed database. Notably, we focused on evaluating the use of digital data for epidemiological studies and refrained from making any comments on the conclusions drawn by researchers. Further studies should evaluate the interpretation and validity of use of digital data for epidemiological studies.",
