            "text": "It may be a challenge to clarify traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies because their mechanisms are usually unclear and many ingredients in these herbal formula may exert their effects by regulating multiple pathways and targets1. Recently, TCM has been considered to highlight targets in interconnected pathways that can be used to cure complex disease. The integration of TCM and \u201cnetwork\u201d pharmacology provides an innovative approach for TCM theory of both reductionist and holistic medicine, and bridges traditional application and modern drug discovery2, 3. TCM was widely used for the clinical treatment of infectious diseases for thousands of years in China, and it is based on different philosophies than those of Western medicine, which are based on antibiotics4. Now, TCM has also played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infection during several large respiratory disease outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired pneumonia5, 6. Although the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear from the perspective of modern medicine, a therapeutic regimen combining Chinese and Western medicines has gained acceptance because it reduces resistance and toxicity.",

QF is approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (No. Z12020757) and has been used clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infection with excellent clinical effects. In our previous studies, QF alleviates asthma and has anti-inflammatory activities7, 8. Four types of NF-\u03baB inhibitors, including arctigenin (ATG) derivatives, cholic acid (CLA) derivatives, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and sinapic acid (SPA), were screened9 In this study, these anti-inflammatory compounds were quantified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The effects of QF on Pseudomona aeruginosa\u2013induced lung infection in mice were investigated, and possible synergetic anti-inflammatory mechanisms for suppressing bacterial pneumonia by mutual regulation of the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways were identified.",

Pretreatment with medium and high-dose QF significantly reduced histological injury, with less obstruction of small airways and recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively).

IL-8 can induce immune cell infiltration, and RANTES causes mononuclear leukocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes to participate in inflammation13, 14.

FAK, a protein tyrosine kinase, can activate PI3K and MAPK to regulate the expression of cytokines in the immune and inflammatory responses28, 29. Furthermore, Ras is a GTPase, which activates ERK and p38 to regulate the generation of inflammatory factors30. By contrast, after binding to membrane receptors or activating JAK, cytokines and other growth factor can activate PI3K and MAPKs to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells and the expression of pro-inflammatory factors31. The pro-inflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 is not only a basic factor of the inflammatory response, but it also acts on Gram-negative bacteria through a positive feedback pathway and synergistically enhances the infection32. In this study, cultured BEAS-2B cells induced with TNF-\u03b1 were selected for the inflammation model to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of QF in vitro.
