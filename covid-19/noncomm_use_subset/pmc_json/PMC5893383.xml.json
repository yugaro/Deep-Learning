It is a group C betacoronavirus, distantly related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 2002\u20132003 (Zaki et al., 2012). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus also causes a similar acute respiratory illness, and as of December 2017, 2103 cases have been confirmed in 27 countries with 733 deaths (35% case fatality ratio) (World Health Organization, 2017). Infection has been diagnosed in multiple countries, but all cases have an epidemiologic link to the Middle East.",

            "text": "Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is thought to be of animal origin. Investigations of bats and other animals have found near identical sequences, including MERS-CoV in camels (Briese et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014; Reusken, Farag, et al., 2014; Reusken, Messadi, et al., 2014). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels (referred to hereafter as \u201ccamels\u201d) (Adney et al., 2014). Further studies identified that the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is relatively conserved among mammals, suggesting a likelihood of cross-species transmission (Raj et al., 2013). However, only camels and alpacas have been found seropositive (Reusken, Ababneh, et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2016), and the virus has only been isolated from camels (Hemida et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014; Reusken, Ababneh, et al., 2013). The evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may jump between other mammals and camels, and that camels play a role as an intermediate host that transmits MERS-CoV directly to humans (Al Hammadi et al., 2015; Anthony et al., 2017; Azhar et al., 2014; Drosten, Kellam, & Memish, 2014; Memish et al., 2014; Nowotny & Kolodziejek, 2014; Sabir et al., 2016).",

Nosocomial transmission has accounted for several clusters associated with multiple hospitals in the KSA (Cotten et al., 2013, 2014; Memish, Al-Tawfiq, & Assiri, 2013). Human-to-human transmission appears to require extended close contact with an infected individual. Consequently, most of the clusters have occurred in families and healthcare workers. Tertiary transmission was observed with the 2015 outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea (Cho et al., 2016; Park et al., 2015).",

These larger outbreaks raise the question of whether these outbreak-associated strains have enhanced transmissibility (Drosten, Muth, et al., 2014). SARS-CoV acquired characteristic genetic changes as the virus was sampled from humans during the early epidemic, suggesting that these mutations may play a role in either replication fitness or transmissibility (Bolles, Donaldson, & Baric, 2011; Chinese Sars Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Song et al., 2005; Wong, Li, Moore, Choe, & Farzan, 2004).

These cases include patients from three hospital-associated clusters, three household-associated clusters and three sporadic cases from the UAE (Al Hosani et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2016). Additionally, due to the risk factors associated with contact with dromedary camels, respiratory samples were collected from camels at farms near where the human cases originated.

All six patients in HCA cluster III with direct contacts to 2014_008 differ by 0\u20133 nt, compared to the index case 2014_008 (Table 1). According to the contact tracing data, case 2014_030 may have been directly or indirectly infected by 2014_008 during their overlapping stays in the hospital ward, and 2014_030 went on to infect 2014_045 and 2014_033 (Hunter et al., 2016). Complete virus genomes from patients 2014_008, 2014_030 and 2014_033 were sequenced and found to be identical (Figure 3a, Table 1). Both S and N sequences from patient 2014_045 were identical to those from 2014_030 (Figure 3b, Table 1). These data are consistent with the epidemiological data (Figure 2) (Hunter et al., 2016). The genomic data provide clarification regarding the tertiary patient 2014_026. The recorded transmission chain (2014_008 > 2014_018 > 2014_026) would require three nt changes, including two reversions, while a different, but plausible chain (2014_008 > 2014_023 > 2014_026) only requires one nt change (Table 1). There is insufficient epidemiological data to clarify this discrepancy. Genomes from the other three direct contacts in HH cluster C to 2014_008 differ by one-two nt (Table 1).",

For the analysis, we ran CLC\u2019s quality-based variant detection algorithm using 5% as a conservative cut-off. We observed mixed bases distributed throughout the genome in each sample without noting obvious hot spots. This analysis shows that at position 11775 in index patient 2014_008, bases T and C are present at almost an equal number of reads, coding for amino acids as isoleucine (base T) or threonine (base C). However, in the HCA cluster III and HH cluster C, only one nucleotide or the other is present in the contact cases. Of the nine direct contact cases sequenced, five harbour the C variant and four harbour the T variant exclusively. Another notable observation was that secondary cases 2014_011 and 2014_017 contain the nonsynonymous mutation A12891C (ORF1ab E4208A). In the index case 2014_008, 30.6% of the bases sequenced at that position are C. This suggests multiple possibilities for founder viruses upon transmission.",

We sequenced MERS-CoV genomes recovered from three camels (1B-A, 2B-E and 1H-F) near the KSA border, two camels (3B-C and 1H-D) from a farm near Al Ain and one camel (1H-B) from a farm in the Western Region, also linked with a known human case (Table 2). The sequences recovered from these camels were very similar to the human MERS-CoV sequences in this study, differing by 3\u20138 nt, compared to the nearest UAE human MERS-CoV sequence (Table 2). Further, we constructed maximum likelihood trees on the full genomes and S genes (Figure 4, Figure S1). The majority of human and camel MERS-CoVs sequenced in this study belongs to lineage 2 as defined by Sabir et al., (2016). Sequences for which we only have the S/N sequence (2013_007, 2013_008, 2013_003 and 2014_045) also cluster within lineage 2 (Figure S1). Healthcare-associated cluster III and HH cluster C form a monophyletic group and are closely related to two camel sequences 3B-C and 1H-D. The rest of the clusters are scattered at different positions within the lineage. Among them, HCA cluster I from 2013 defines an isolated cluster within lineage 2. HH clusters A and B are closely related to each other and to one of the Oman cases from around the same time period (Figure 4). The sequences from HH clusters A and B also cluster with a MERS-CoV genome recovered from a camel in the UAE earlier that year (GenBank KP719927). The sequence from the HCA cluster II index case (2014_002) is closely related to the camel sequence 1H-B, which comes from a farm in the Western Region. They differ by three nt which is consistent with their potential epidemiologic link (the patient was from the Western Region and had contact with camels). While there may be no direct linkage among the different small UAE clusters (HCA I, HH A, HH B and HCA II), HCA cluster III or HH cluster C, the phylogenetic closeness implies a temporal and geographic constraint. The close connection between geographic and phylogenetic relatedness is also apparent in the context of the other known MERS-CoV sequences (Figure 4).",

Under that rate, the divergence date between UAE clusters and the Al Hasa cluster was most likely before August 2012 (Figure 5). Furthermore, the divergence date of the genome at Node A, the common ancestor of human and camel viruses associated with UAE cluster HCA III and HH C, is estimated to be early January 2014 (Node A). Node C represents a separate divergence of human 2014_XXX and camel CoVs which occurred around the same time. Human and camel case-associated viruses also are estimated to have diverged at Node B in February 2014 (Figure 5).

In spring of 2014, there was a steep increase in the number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO. This study demonstrates that these outbreaks in the UAE are likely due to independent zoonotic transmission events followed by nosocomial amplification which is consistent with the epidemiological investigations (Al Hosani et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2016).",

We know that several of the index cases in this study had close contact with camels from different regions of the UAE (Al Hosani et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2016). Here, we show genomic evidence linking the MERS-CoV genome from camel 1H-B (Western Region) to case 2014_002, a person who visited the farm where this animal was kept\u2014the genomes were a distance of three nt. Although the camels from KSA/UAE border (1B-A, 2B-E, and 1H-F) were not directly associated with any known human cases, the genome sequence clustered with human case 2014_XXX at a distance of eight nucleotides. This suggests a zoonotic link to case 2014_XXX. In HCA cluster III, although there was no recorded camel contact with the index patient, sequences collected from the Al Ain-area camels 3B-C and 1H-C just before the outbreak (February 2014) show close similarity at the nucleotide level (seven nt) to the human index case 2014_008 (Figure 3, Table 2). Additionally, the 2013_002 case, who lived near the KSA border and had frequent contact with camels, harboured a MERS-CoV sequence closely linked to a camel-derived sequence from KSA already published in GenBank (Muhairi et al., 2016). The fact that the camel from Dubai (KP719927) is closely related to HH A cases suggests that MERS-CoV may have been imported to an Abu Dhabi camel market from Dubai.",

Taken together with the molecular clock data showing different human/camel virus divergence dates for different human MERS outbreaks, we conclude that the human and camel viruses are not distinct viruses and at least some strains are likely capable of infecting both species. Notably, human-to-human transmission chains have been relatively short, which suggests that MERS-CoV may not be transmitted efficiently from human to human at this time, having a transient and mostly dead- end infection. Further study of MERS-CoV in camel populations may lead to an understanding of the viral genes that are important in tropism and replication fitness in camel versus human hosts.",

Briese et al. demonstrated this phenomenon in linking a camel MERS-CoV minor population genome directly to a human MERS case (Briese et al., 2014). A newer study examining camel MERS-CoV isolates observed that although there were only a handful of differences between strains at the consensus level, there were hundreds of intrahost variants (Borucki et al., 2016).

These data will be important in determining what molecular changes in the virus may lead to increased transmission between humans. Exposure to camels is a risk factor for human MERS-CoV infection, and undoubtedly, new cases will continue to emerge. Surveillance of camels on the Arabian Peninsula and in eastern Africa has shown a high rate of seropositivity as well as some MERS-CoV shedding (Alagaili et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; M\u00fcller et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014; Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013).
