The loss of endothelial integrity in the process of ALI/ARDS also causes injured pulmonary cells to release some tissue factors or enzymes, which would lead to the initiation of complement cascade10., 11..

            "text": "As a traditional Chinese medicine with actions of clearing heat and eliminating toxins, the whole plant of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) is commonly used for the treatment of pulmonary symptoms (including lung abscess, dyspnea, phlegm and cough), as well as infectious diseases, anaphylaxis, cancer and viral infection14., 15., 16., 17.. A Chinese multiherb remedy with H. cordata as the principal ingredient had been used for the treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 200318 and was found to have significant anti-complementary activity19. Our previous study indicated that the crude H. cordata polysaccharides (CHCP)20 and flavonoids21 were the major anti-complementary principles of this plant. Some anti-complementary polysaccharides showed potent effects on complement-associated diseases in vivo22., 23.. The presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypical endotoxin, in blood can cause the immediate activation of the complement cascade. We had reported that CHCP could ameliorate LPS-induced ALI in mice and reduce the complement activation products deposited in the lung tissue20. However, it is still unclear whether this effect was a direct result of CHCP's anti-complementary activity in vivo. Herein, the beneficial effect of CHCP on ALI was further evaluated using a \u201ctwo-hit\u201d ALI rat model induced by hemorrhagic shock plus LPS instillation, which is more susceptive to lung injury24. Specifically, the in vivo anti-complementary activity of CHCP was also assessed. Besides pulmonary infections, fever is another typical indication for heat-clearing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Therefore this paper investigated in vivo the anti-pyretic effects and anti-complementary activity of CHCP on a febrile rat model induced by LPS.",

As the complement source, the 1:80 diluted serum of guinea pig was chosen to give sub-maximal lysis in the absence of complement inhibitors. CHCP and heparin, used as the positive control, were dissolved in BBS. Different dilutions of samples (200 \u03bcL) were incubated with 200 \u03bcL guinea pig serum, 100 \u03bcL sheep erythrocytes (4.0 \u00d7 108 cells/mL) and 100 \u03bcL rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1800 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Optical density (OD) of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm. The sample control of each dilution, the blank control and 100% lysis control were all prepared under the same conditions. The corrected absorbance of each dilution of CHCP sample was obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the sample control from each value. The activity was determined by means of triplicate measurements and expressed as the 50% inhibition (CH50).",

The rats were randomly divided into six groups: Sham, ALI model and prednisone (70 mg/kg) groups, as well as CHCP groups of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. All animals were anesthetized with 1 g/kg urethane (i.p.). The right common carotid artery was cannulated with a 24-gauge Angiocath indwelling needle filled with 0.4% heparin for the monitor of mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood sampling and resuscitation. The heparinization was performed by injecting 0.1 mL 0.4% heparin through the angiocath to prevent clotting. Hemorrhagic shock was initiated by blood withdrawal, leading to a reduction of the MAP to 40\u00b15 mmHg in 20 min. This blood pressure was maintained by further blood withdrawal if MAP was higher than 45 mmHg and by infusion of 0.5 mL normal saline (NS) if the MAP was less than 35 mmHg. After a hypotensive period of 60 min, rats were resuscitated by transfusion of the withdrawn blood in 1 h.

As demonstrated in the literature, C3 functions to activate both the classical and alternative pathways and makes up 70% of the total protein in the complement system30. C4, the second most abundant complement protein in serum, is a glycoprotein which functions as the limited activation step in the activation of the classical pathway2. It suggested that CHCP could be effective in treating the complement-associated diseases. ALI is a life-threatening complication of various systemic inflammations and of pulmonary disorders that can cause a mortality rate of 30\u201340%9. The current main treatment against ALI has been the application of glucocorticoids, which often lead to severe adverse reactions during the long treatment. Hence, other choice of agents with less adverse effects is crucial to the recovery of ALI. Based on the important role of complement activation in the induction of inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS3., 12., the in vivo anti-complementary activity of CHCP and its preventive effect on ALI were examined in the \u201ctwo-hit\u201d ALI rat model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury followed by LPS instillation. This \u201ctwo-hit\u201d ALI rat model had been shown to induce an exaggerated response for more susceptibility to lung injury24. I/R is believed to augment neutrophil-mediated lung injury by priming circulating neutrophils for increased superoxide production31. The activation of complement system is known to be necessary for the full development of inflammatory responses and tissue injuries associated with I/R in pulmonary injury3. Based on I/R, intratracheal instillation of LPS will induce an ideal experimental model of ALI by resulting in pulmonary injury with great BALF neutrophil infiltration32.",

This causes blood neutrophils to sequester in pulmonary capillaries and dramatically result in the release of toxic oxygen species, which can destroy pulmonary endothelial cells as well as basement membranes34. And an oxidant-antioxidant imbalance is thought to underlie as one of the important pathogenesis of lung injury10. These findings provide strong evidence that ALI following the over-activation of complement system is closely linked to the production of oxygen metabolites by lung-sequestered neutrophils. In the experiment, the proportions of neutrophils were actually suppressed with the administration of CHCP, suggesting that CHCP potently attenuated the neutrophil respiratory burst. SOD is an important antioxidant enzyme that scavenges the superoxide free radicals35. MDA is recognized as a standard measurement for the degree of oxidation36. The pathogenesis of ALI resulted in the decreased SOD level and the elevated MDA content. Taking CHCP could reduce the pulmonary oxidative stress to modulate the oxidant-antioxidant balance.",

Composed of large amount of monosaccharides through glucosidic bonds, polysaccharides are too complex to accurately control the quality by one specific analytical method. Multiple methods were used to comprehensively characterize the structure of CHCP, including contents of carbohydrate and uronic acid, molecular weight, and monosaccharide composition.",
