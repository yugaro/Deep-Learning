Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from 275 \u00b5L of clinical sample, and 20-\u00b5L PCR reactions were prepared using 2X Platinum Multiplex Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 2.4 \u00b5L of TEM-PCR primer mix, and 4 \u00b5L of template DNA. Amplification was performed in 96-well plates on the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). In a single reaction, each target was amplified with nested primers and subsequently amplified with a pair of universal primers containing proprietary sequences to amplify all targets in the single reaction. The reverse universal primer was biotinylated for downstream detection. Biotinylated amplicons were detected by hybridization to a detection probe covalently coupled to a glass microarray substrate, and streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added. Fluorescent signal emission was measured on a SensoSpot imaging reader (Sensovation AG, Radolfzell, Germany).",

Additionally, TEM-PCR reliably detected methicillin and clindamycin resistance in S. aureus isolates.

Clinical specimens submitted for TEM-PCR testing are batched by panel type and processed daily, and test results are reported to physicians within 7 hours of specimen receipt in the laboratory. Culture-based methods often take 24\u201348 hours to identify a pathogen and an additional 24\u201348 hours until AST is complete. This 48\u201396-hour delay leads to prolonged broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial exposure until AST is secured. In our study, TEM-PCR was 100% concordant with culture-based methods for methicillin and clindamycin resistance testing. The lower erythromycin resistance detection by TEM-PCR is most likely due to the limited targets selected for this assay (ermA and ermC), though this may also be a result of inadequate sensitivity of this component of the multiplex assay. The additions of ermB, msrA, msrB, and mphC gene targets would likely increase erythromycin resistance detection; however, given that erythromycin is not used in the treatment of MSKI in children, inclusion of these targets has limited clinical utility. Overall, TEM-PCR allows for rapid AST results, decreasing time to optimal therapy and increasing antimicrobial stewardship.",
