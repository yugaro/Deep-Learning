Unfortunately, viral emergence has outpaced the discovery and development of compounds capable of treating these pathogens. Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays has no problem identifying active compounds of high potency. However, identifying the target and predicting the likelihood for evolution of resistance generally take years of effort following compound discovery.",

This class of antiviral agent has always been touted as having a high barrier to resistance (8). The typical explanation for this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (9). Elimination of the most-fit members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerges from the surviving, low-fitness members of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (10). Restoration of fitness may be the insurmountable barrier precluding the development of resistance to chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotides.",

We describe a microfluidics device that can be used to produce complete dose-response curves. We have used this device to compare three mechanistically distinct classes of antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor [2\u2032-C-methyl-adenosine (2\u2032-C-Me-A)], a PV protease inhibitor (rupintrivir), and two heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors [geldanamycin (GA) and ganetespib (GS)]. We find that single-cell analysis distinguishes these classes of inhibitors. We suggest that addition of single-cell analysis to the existing paradigm for preclinical development of antiviral therapies may have the potential to identify leads with limited potential for development of resistance.",

S1E) with maximum occupancy near 90% (Fig. 1D and fig. S1). Under conditions in which an inhibitor reduces infection to 10%, ~100 infected cells will be observed using this device.

The nonobligate, chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleoside 2\u2032-C-Me-A is the prototype for the HCV RdRp inhibitor, sofosbuvir, and related compounds (13). In a previous study, we evaluated infections that survived treatment when present at a concentration that reduces the number of infections by 50% [median inhibitory concentration (IC50)]. To our surprise, we observed selective ablation of cells infected with virus variants capable of the fastest rates of replication and the highest yields of replicated RNA (7). This experiment suffered from the inability to evaluate concentrations of drug higher than the value of the IC50. Here, we use 2\u2032-C-Me-A to validate the new device.",

In the case of 2\u2032-C-Me-A, concentrations greater than 50 \u03bcM exhibit toxicity (14); therefore, these data do not fit to a hyperbola (fig. S2B).

To analyze the single-cell data, we use five phenomenological parameters extracted from each time course (fig. S2C). These parameters are maximum fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus generation time; start point, which is the earliest time in which fluorescence can be detected; and midpoint, the time of half-maximum fluorescence. This analysis leads to a collection of data points for each parameter value measured in each cell. Instead of displaying the primary data in a scatter plot (fig. S2, D and E), we display and analyze the curve derived from the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function from the raw data (fig. S2E). Our statistical analysis uses an unpaired two-tailed t test to determine if a significant difference exists for the means of a given parameter under two experimental conditions. In these experiments, the area under the curve defining each distribution has been normalized to one for ease of comparison.

We analyzed the single-cell data obtained at all concentrations (table S2) but focused only on the concentrations approximating the IC50 and 2 \u00d7 IC50, 10 and 20 nM, respectively, to emphasize trends in the data. At both concentrations, we observed a statistically significant difference compared with the control for all parameters: maximum (Fig. 2B), slope (Fig. 2C), infection time (Fig. 2D), start point (Fig. 2E), and midpoint (Fig. 2F). This outcome with rupintrivir is distinct from that above with 2\u2032-C-Me-A. We conclude that not all antiviral agents interfere with the viral population in the same manner or at the same stage(s) of the lifecycle reflected by the parameters determined by monitoring the kinetics of fluorescence produced by GFP reporter virus.",

One approach to delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral combinations (30, 31). What is often evaluated is the ability of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2\u2032-C-Me-A to synergize with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC50 values (Fig. 4A). In the absence of drug, 34 \u00b1 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 \u00b1 2, 30 \u00b1 3, or 15 \u00b1 3% in the presence of 2\u2032-C-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, respectively. On the basis of this observation alone, the conclusion would be that this combination of antiviral agents is not even additive. Analysis of the entire single-cell dataset is presented in table S4. Because 2\u2032-C-Me-A exhibits the most substantial antiviral effect relative to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, here we compare the combination to 2\u2032-C-Me-A alone. We observed a statistically significant difference for all parameters (Fig. 4, B to F). Single-cell analysis therefore has the ability to reveal efficacy of drug combinations masked at the population level.

The mechanistically related, but chemically distinct, inhibitors of HSP90 cluster by PCA (see GA and GS in Fig. 5A). We evaluated the antiviral drug combinations in the context of the PCA space (Fig. 5B). An additive combination is defined by the vector bisecting the parallelogram defined by the experiment in the absence of either drug (control) and the experiments in the presence of each drug alone (Fig. 5B). The 2\u2032-C-Me-A\u2013GA combination was synergistic, with the position indicating that the combination delays the start point and retards the infection time.

As a result, substantial between-cell variation exists in all quantifiable parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as these is the non\u2013self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single cell (38, 39). The practical complication arising from this phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused by a perturbation, e.g., exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the step(s) of the viral lifecycle affected most by the perturbation.",

Our data analysis pipeline emphasizes five phenomenological parameters with correlates to traditional parameters for assessment of the viral lifecycle. The major finding of this study is that each class of antiviral therapeutics exhibited a unique signature with respect to the five phenomenological parameters measured. We used the absolute value of the difference of each parameter in the presence and absence of the antiviral agent to visualize the signature for the antiviral agent and compare one antiviral agent to another (fig. S6A). It was possible to use PCA to stratify the different therapeutic classes (Fig. 5A). Both GA and GS overlapped by PCA despite their substantial differences in structure and efficacy (Fig. 5A). Drug combinations, which failed to affect establishment of infection, exhibited synergy when single-cell parameters were monitored (Figs. 3 and 5B).",

An efficient polymerase is likely required to replicate fast and to the highest levels. Such a polymerase might be expected to use the antiviral nucleotide better, leading to extinction of this population of viruses. These same members of the viral population were sensitive to rupintrivir (fig. S6C). In this case, at concentrations equivalent to or lower than the IC50, binding is driven by the concentration of the protease target, which would be highest in cells replicating fastest and to the highest levels. GA only affected a subset of 2\u2032-C-Me-A and rupintrivir-sensitive members, those with a fast rate of replication (fig. S6D). This observation is quite interesting in that fast rates of replication in our assay mean fast rates of translation to produce GFP. Chaperones like HSP90 would be expected to be most useful under these conditions. A comparable analysis using the start point and infection time provided an even greater distinction between the three classes of antiviral agents studied herein (fig. S6, E to G). Most noteworthy was the observation that rupintrivir retarded the time it took to establish infection and to complete replication (fig. S6F). This observation may reflect the role of the protease in promoting replication by cleaving cellular antagonists of the virus lifecycle.",

The resolution afforded by this approach is unprecedented when compared with other cell-based approaches, which only provide a measure of efficacy. Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogs to be synthesized during the drug development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action; single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis instead of much, much later in the development process. Last, although we have used antiviral agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will be applicable to the discovery and development of any class of therapeutics that can be assessed in cell culture.",

PCA was performed using the mean values of the maximum, slope, infection time, start point, and midpoint from the various drug treatment concentrations and control groups. The top two principal components accounted for 94% of the total variance. The light blue lines indicate the relationship between variables in the space of the first two components. (B) The pair of scores for principle components 1 and 2 for the drug combination experiment shown in Fig. 4 was plotted in the PCA space from (A). The expected vector for additive behavior of the combination is indicated. This analysis reveals the synergistic behavior of the combination of 2\u2032-C-Me-A and GA.",
