Once PI cattle are identified by laboratory diagnosis,\nresponsible officers must promptly report them to a competent authority and cull them.\nOther animals in the same herds must then be tested for BVDV infection (outbreak\ninvestigation of newly infected herds). To control BVD in the Japanese cattle population,\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan has promoted a vaccination\nand test and culling policy. In addition, optional measures, including compulsory testing\nof animals introduced from outside, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing of\nanimals, and herd screening using BTM, have been implemented in areas where BVD was\nbecoming endemic and regarded as a serious issue that required to be controlled. In this\nstudy, considering animal introduction to a target area, we evaluated scenario models with\noptions for compulsory testing of introduced animals and/or BTM testing using a previously\ndeveloped simulation model.

The animals introduced from outside, which\nsatisfied the criteria of a test animal, were assumed to be mandatorily diagnosed with the\nsame test sensitivity as one of outbreak investigation that observed in the previous\nstudy, and test-positive animals were automatically culled prior to introduction in this\nsimulation. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of each control measure, products of the\nunit cost and the number of test animals were calculated for BTM and compulsory testing,\nand these products were summed as the total cost of the scenario, which would be generally\ncovered by farmers and agricultural parties. On the other hand, the cost of outbreak\ninvestigation was not included into the total cost because this is a response mandated by\nthe Act on Domestic Animal Infectious Disease Control in Japan and is covered by the\ngovernment. A BTM sample of between 100 and 200 cattle is said to be usually used for\ndiagnosis by RT-PCR method. Given that it costs 2,000 JPY to run one RT-PCR reaction, the\nunit cost of BTM testing would be estimated as 10 to 20 JPY. The cost of compulsory\ntesting should be assumed either as 2,000 JPY by RT-PCR or as 1,000 JPY by\nantigen-detection using ear-notch sample, which is instructed from the manufacturer.\nFinally, we adopted the cheaper price of each of two tests and set the unit cost of BTM\nand compulsory testing as 10 JPY and 1,000 JPY per animal, respectively.",

The sum of the proportions of missed animals despite a set of\nall control measures in a scenario and of estimated natural infections per 10,000 animals\nwas regarded as the expected prevalence of BVD among the inherent cattle in the target\narea in the next year. The estimated number of natural infections was calculated based on\nthe rate of naturally infected herds in a study by Santman-Berends et al.\nusing field data regarding local risk factors of BVD infection in a study by Kadohira\net al. [20, 34]. The number of estimated natural infections in this\nstudy was set as the product of the number of missed animals and 0.02, which was defined\nas the natural infection parameter per BVD cattle. Practically, a set of 5%, 50%, and 95%\npercentiles of the sum of the missed animals and expected natural infections were\ncalculated in each simulation and used for the probability of persistent infection among\ninherent cattle in the next year as the lower limit, median, and upper limit,\nrespectively.

            "text": "According to the latest large-scale survey in Japan, seven cattle on six farms tested\npositive for persistent infection with BVDV among 5,949 cattle from 79 farms analyzed,\nresulting in 7.59% (95% CI: 3.1\u201316.4%) of farms comprising PI animals and 0.12% of cattle\nbeing PI (95% CI: 0.05\u20130.25%) [21]. Four out of six\naffected farms had not implemented vaccination for one year, and none of the seven PI\nanimals had been vaccinated, indicating that non-vaccination may be a major factor in Japan\nfor persistent BVDV infection in cattle. In addition, the fact that most of the PI animals\nin the above-mentioned survey were detected in heifers implies the importance of monitoring\nheifers for BVD control as high priority. Given these points, we aimed to develop scenario\nmodels to monitor non-vaccinated animals and/or heifers intensively but cheaply. The results\nobtained in this study confirmed the efficacy of compulsory testing of introduced animals,\nand targeting heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle rather than all cattle, should be\nsufficient to be efficacious and highly cost effective if BTM tests are implemented\nconcurrently. In addition, more effort might be required to arrange a system to register\nintroduced animals with minimum necessary information including vaccination status,\npossibility of pregnancy as well as cattle ID in order to grasp the animal introduction\naccurately. Although BTM testing contributes less to the detection of introduced animals, it\nshould be regarded as a very powerful tool to monitor the entire population inexpensively,\nand in general, the proportion of lactating cattle to the entire population is much larger\nthan that of introduced animals. In Japan, BTM tests are used for the detection of BVDV\ngenome, which is differing from well-developed antibody detection system in Europe. The\neffectiveness of BTM tests using antigen monitoring has been widely recognized and reported\n[20,21,22]; however, this effective and cheap monitoring program\ncannot be applied to beef cattle population. Hence, the prevalence of BVD animals in the\nbeef cattle population in Japan might have seldom been reported. A monitoring program for\nBVD in beef cattle also needs to be developed to confirm the BVD prevalence among these\nherds.",

Ultimately, under very low BVDV prevalence,\nthe monitoring effectiveness at 0% of vaccination coverage was not apparently different from\nthat at 100%. These findings may trigger suggestions for reviewing implementation of\ncompulsory testing to introduced non-vaccinated animals because, under very low BVDV\nprevalence, the efficacy of compulsory testing would be rarely affected by vaccination\ncoverage. It indicates, if efficacy of monitoring programs were not different, many of\nstakeholders might select the cheaper program to decrease financial burdens. However, this\nchange would require intensive discussion with convincing scientific evidence because it\nshould be implemented under the hypothesis that the very low prevalence of BVDV is\nmaintained by proper biosecurity measures with different stakeholders in outside of the\ntarget area. Otherwise, BVDV would spread rapidly among sensitive cattle in outside of the\ntarget area that has not been conferred enough immunity to prevent its re-infection by\nvaccination, and then might be introduced to the target area by animal movement. This would\nbe supported by the model analysis that low compliance with the eradication program owing to\nlack of proper epidemiological information sharing due to revising the program during its\nimplementation may accelerate BVDV re-infection [38].\nIndeed, it is not practical to abolish BVD vaccination in Japan because BVD vaccines, both\nattenuated or inactivated, are widely used in Japan together with several major virus\nantigens in cattle as mixed vaccine; hence we cannot quit BVD vaccination easily only due to\ndecrease of BVD prevalence.",

However, because effectiveness of the control measure would\nrequire several years to materialize in most cases, maintaining high motivation to sustain\nthe measures is often challenging. In other words, control measures should be implemented\nwith the cooperation of all stakeholders and evaluated prior to commencement as well as\nduring adoption of appropriate program change in response to unexpected occurrences or with\nrespect to the balance between effectiveness and expenditure. Although we focused on the\ncost of voluntary control measures, compulsory testing of introduced animals, and mass\nscreening of BTM, another study calculated the net production losses due to BVDV infection\nand control expenditures [37]. It should be\nbeneficial to spend control expenditures in a short period if the objective is to reduce net\nproduction losses [29]. Thus, an eradication program\nmay not be highly cost effective when it is launched; however, once a disease-free status is\nachieved, the longer the status is maintained, the more cost effective the program becomes\n[42].
