The study population consisted of 18 years and older individuals with underlying medical conditions, healthy \u226565 years old individuals and pregnant women living in the community, who were admitted to one of the participating sites due to SARI with no contraindication for influenza vaccination, that is, allergies to influenza vaccine and other adverse events to vaccinations in the past. Patients were eligible to be included in the study when they were hospitalised for at least 24 hours, but not longer than 48 hours, had a swab taken \u22647 days after self-reported disease onset, did not test positive and were not hospitalised for any influenza virus in the current season before the inclusion, and were suffering from SARI with at least one of the systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, headache and myalgia) or deterioration of general condition or deterioration of functional status, and at least one of the respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat and shortness of breath). Patients were not eligible to be included in the study when they were institutionalised, unwilling to participate, not able to communicate, not able and/or willing to give written informed consent (IC). Eligible patients were asked to provide one throat and one nose swab specimen for influenza testing by the multiplex RT-PCR. As data from shedding studies propose that influenza virus detection decreases after 7 days, recruitment was limited to patients who were swabbed not more than 7 days after onset of the symptoms.18 Swabbing was done after the information on demographic and clinical characteristics was collected from the medical history and patient self-report.",

In England, for example, GPs and other providers are encouraged to contact eligible patients in September and actively invite them to attend the clinics and get vaccinated against influenza.17 37 In Lithuania, personal invitations are usually not sent and the vaccination coverage among the healthcare workers themselves is quite low,36 which likely influences the patients\u2019 decisions as well. The patients eligible for influenza vaccination (ie, those suffering from underlying condition, \u226565 years old, pregnant women) are usually offered and administered the vaccine if they are visiting their GP during the weeks when the vaccine is available (October\u2013December), which limits the number of patients who would potentially be willing to get vaccinated if they were actively invited.",
