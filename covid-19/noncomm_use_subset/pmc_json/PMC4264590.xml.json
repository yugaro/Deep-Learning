We identified 13 observational studies published between 1918 and 1920, which studied 980 patients who received a clinical diagnosis of influenza-associated pneumonia or Spanish influenza A (H1N1) infection [17, 20, 33\u201335, 38\u201344, 47]. It is unclear whether some of these studies recruited patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia. Sixteen observational studies that met our protocol eligibility criteria were published between 2003 and 2011. Four studies reported outcomes for 29 patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) [23, 26, 27, 36], 4 studies reported outcomes for 104 patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [24, 30, 37, 48], and 8 studies reported outcomes for 214 patients with SARS [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46]. The clinical status of patients at the time of treatment administration varied, as did concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Convalescent plasma was used in all observational studies of SARS-CoV, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and avian influenza A(H5N1) infections (Supplementary Table 2). For Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection, 2 observational studies used convalescent plasma, and 11 used convalescent serum (Supplementary Table 2). No studies that used hyperimmune immunoglobulin met our protocol eligibility criteria. The use of sham treatments or placebos was not reported.",

A retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance (absolute reduction in CFR, 23%; 95% CI, 6%\u201342%; P = .049) [46]. A second study with a comparator group described a cluster of 29 cases of SARS-CoV infection in which 1 patient received convalescent plasma and survived (absolute reduction in CFR, 7%; 95% CI, \u22122% to 17%; P = .93) [32, 49]. Three small studies reported treatment of 5 patients with no deaths, and a case series by Cheng et al reported a CFR of 12.5% (10 of 80 patients) following treatment (Supplementary Table 3) [8, 9, 25, 28, 31, 45, 50]. Within this series, a subgroup analysis of 30 patients found that those treated when PCR-positive but seronegative for SARS-CoV were more likely to be discharged within 22 days of admission than those who were seropositive at the time of plasma infusion (67% vs 20%; P = .001). A further subgroup analysis of 48 patients found that receipt of convalescent plasma treatment <14 days after onset of symptoms improved the likelihood of discharge within 22 days of admission (58% vs 16%; P\n< .001); this remained significant after adjustment for age, viral status, time of administration, and lactate dehydrogenase level, suggesting that early treatment with convalescent plasma may be beneficial. However, allocation of treatment was mostly based on the physician's decision and the availability of plasma, and this study was at high risk of bias.",

Observational studies were predominately case reports or series, had no control groups, and had a moderate to high risk of bias. Findings were commonly at high risk of confounding by indication. Although selection or reporting bias may favor the intervention, recruiting patients who are clinically deteriorating or moribund would bias the result in the opposite direction. Adequate methodological or statistical measures were infrequently used to control bias and confounding, and we identified numerous sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We cannot be assured that all Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection studies were included since our protocol did not include hand searching of literature from 1918\u20131920. Although our post hoc meta-analyses were undertaken to help inform clinical decision making, the theoretical rationale for pooling mortality data from different viral etiologies remains to be fully established. The results obtained must be considered experimental and interpreted with an appropriate level of caution.",

The evidence for a reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma is strongest for SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Although it is clinically rational to consider novel therapies for critically ill patients, there is evidence that maximum benefit from convalescent plasma might be realized through early initiation of therapy. However, many treatment protocols currently mention convalescent plasma as a treatment of last resort. If this treatment is considered for MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients with SARI, it should ideally only be administered in acute centers able to manage potential treatment-related complications, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury. We consider this a precautionary approach because of the limited clinical experience of administering convalescent plasma to this patient group.",

This would help clarify the potential benefits and harms of treatment, identify optimal dosage, and ascertain whether repeated treatments are relevant factors for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies that adopt a standardized minimum data set are needed to better evaluate convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for MERS-CoV infection before it can be fully recommended or before refinements can be made over its current use, other than our current recommendation for early use. The WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium are currently developing a clinical trial protocol to investigate the effectiveness of passive immunotherapy for patients with SARI.",
