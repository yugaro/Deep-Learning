He did not visit a camel farm, did not consume camel milk or camel products. As he visited a local health clinic in Kuwait two times (days 7 and 9 of his illness), a possible hypothesis is he contracted MERS-CoV at the clinic. However, he already had mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia on day 7, and extensive bilateral lung infiltrates on day 10. Considering the shortest incubation period of 2 days, we can safely say that he had already been infected with MERS-CoV when he visited the clinic, and diarrhea was a presenting symptom of MERS in this patient. It is important to note that of the Saudi patients who were infected with MERS-CoV in the community, less than half had history of exposure to camel.6 Therefore, we should remind that one can be infected with MERS-CoV in the Middle East even if he or she does not have a history of exposure to camels or camel products. A phylogenetic study of MERS-CoV from this patient may shed light on the origin of the infecting virus.",

Although MERS-CoV is considered a respiratory virus and respiratory manifestations are the major clinical feature of MERS, gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in up to 30% of patients with MERS-CoV infection.1 During the 2015 Korea outbreak, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain was reported in 14%, 19%, and 8% of the patients, respectively,7 and diarrhea developed from day 1 of illness.8 The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal manifestations in MERS-CoV infection is not well understood. In a cell culture study, cytopathic effect was observed as early as one day after MERS-CoV inoculation in CaCo-2 cells, a colorectal cancer cell line,9 suggesting the virus can replicate in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. MERS-CoV RNA was also detected in 14.6% (12/82) of stool samples from patients, with maximum concentration of 1.26 \u00d7 105 copies per milliliter,10 and as late as 15 days after symptom onset.11 A recent study using an ex vivo human intestine model demonstrated that MERS-CoV replicated better in intestinal epithelium than in respiratory epithelium,12 suggesting the gastrointestinal track as an alternative route of infection. In our patient, however, we were not able to detect MERS-CoV RNA in his stool samples.",

Indeed, the computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 5 cm-sized consolidation in the left lung, with numerous small infiltrates located in the subpleural spaces. We speculated that the large consolidation was a MERS-CoV pneumonia and the numerous subpleural infiltrates were due to virus-triggered organizing pneumonia.13,14 As the infiltrates were localized mainly in the periphery of the lungs, and probably in the interstitial space rather than in the airspace, we also speculated that symptoms due to airway inflammation, such as cough and sputum production, were not prominent. A recent case report also highlighted that respiratory symptoms did not develop, although chest CT scan showed multiple patch infiltrates in both lungs.15 Therefore, chest radiography should be taken in every patient who is suspected of MERS-CoV infection, even if respiratory symptoms are mild or absent.",

This raised a question whether the case definition should be revised to include diarrhea symptom. The answer depends on whether MERS-CoV is excreted into stool and transmissible to others, however, no fecal transmission has been reported so far. Moreover, as diarrhea is a common and non-specific symptom, many patients with traveler's diarrhea without MERS-CoV infection would undergo unnecessary screening tests. Therefore, inclusion of diarrhea symptom in the case definition for MERS-CoV surveillance requires more data and ensuring evidence.",
