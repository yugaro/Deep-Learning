There are no clear-cut data on the current trend for the incidence and prevalence of BEN. The studies carried out in different endemic areas have produced conflicting information. Some epidemiological studies reported an increase in the prevalence of BEN between 1967 and 1970, a steady state between 1970 and 1984 and ultimately a decrease in some endemic areas [7, 8]. Similarly, in another endemic area, a decreasing incidence over time was found during a follow-up period spanning the time period 1978 to 1997 [9].",

At this stage, which occurs at an older age [13, 14], anaemia is associated with a significant loss of renal function and indicates the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Blood pressure is usually normal, although in the advanced phase it may be elevated but at a lower incidence than in other forms of CKD. Intermittent proteinuria of the tubular type may be found early while in the uraemic phase, it becomes permanent. The urinary sediment shows sparse white and red blood cells. In the early stages of BEN, the loss of urine concentration capacity precedes the decline in the glomerular filtration rate [15\u201317]. Serum proteins and immunoglobulins are unchanged.",

Extreme kidney atrophy has been proposed as a criterion for the clinical diagnosis of BEN. Some studies suggest that the smallest kidneys are found in advanced stages of BEN, whereas others have reported that this occurs in the earlier stages. In BEN patients, it has been found that the dimensions of the kidneys depend on the parental status and the age of offspring. In the offspring of a mother with BEN, ultrasound measurements of the kidney cortex thickness seem to portend a prognostic value [19]. In conclusion, adult offspring in BEN families can be characterized by shorter kidney length and an increased excretion of albumin, total protein and \u03b22-microglobulin, in particular, when the mother had BEN [19, 20].",

Although herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia spp. have been known since antiquity and were used in obstetrics and in the treatment of snake bites (Rosenmund and Reichstein, 1943) [32] in 1981, the use of Aristolochia spp. was forbidden in many countries due to possible carcinogenic effects.

He speculated that human exposure to a toxic component of Aristolochia might occur through ingestion of bread prepared from \ufb02our derived from contaminated grain. He demonstrated in rabbit models that flour prepared from A. clematitis seeds induced a nephropathy, which resembled the findings in BEN. Ivi\u0107 even proved the carcinogenetic potential of the plant as rats developed sarcomas of the skin at the site of injection of aqueous extracts of A. clematitis [35]. Ivi\u0107 concluded that on the basis of geographical, epidemiological and laboratory investigations, there are strong arguments suggesting that endemic nephropathy is essentially caused by chronic poisoning with the seeds of A. clematitis [34]. Although his classic paper presented the brilliant examples of drawing correct conclusions regarding the aetiology of a complex human disease from simple but well thought out experimental observations, this clever hypothesis has never been adequately pursued. His well-documented results attracted more interest from the scientific community many years later.",

Remarkably, UUC had an 11.2-fold higher incidence in endemic than in non-endemic areas. However, this was far less than in the period 1969\u20131988, when UUC was 57.1 times more frequent. UBT were 2.3 times more frequent in endemic than in non-endemic areas, but 11.9 times more frequent in the previous period 1969\u20131988 [61].

It is proposed that they are at a high risk for developing the disease and that a genetic mechanism might be involved in the aetiology of BEN [76]. The additional finding of a specific chromosome marker 3q in BEN was reported, characterized by a discordance in the banding patterns of the long arms, shortening band 3q25, faster fusion of sub-bands q26.1 and q26.3 and lack of differentiation of q24 [89].",

Four out of the five biopsy specimens on extended culture yielded a coronavirus virus which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and Vero cells, but none from the control cultures. It was proposed that the microorganism was a novel coronavirus based on its cross-reactivity with the human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as a porcine-transmissible gastroenteritis virus [91].",

The authors presumed that in this study, organic compounds contributed to higher LCAT-inhibiting activity of Serbian and Romanian drinking water samples from both non-BEN and BEN villages. On the other hand, the higher abundance of organic compounds in drinking water samples from BEN villages caused much higher LCAT-inhibiting activity compared with non-BEN ones.
