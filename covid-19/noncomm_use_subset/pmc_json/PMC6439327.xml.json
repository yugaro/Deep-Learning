            "text": "Human prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders for which no effective treatment is currently available. Prions are proteinaceous infectious pathogens distinct from bacteria or viruses. Accumulation of the structurally abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) causes pathological changes such as neuronal death in the brain, resulting in rapidly progressive cognitive disorders. PrPSc, which is highly enriched in \u03b2-sheet secondary structures, causes misfolding of normal cellular PrP (PrPC) (Prusiner, 1998; Weissmann et al., 2002). In a widely-accepted model of the molecular mechanism of prion pathogenesis, following the expression or introduction of PrPSc, the pathogenic proteins accumulate in and on neurons; subsequently, various inflammatory responses occur and induce neuronal death (Tamguney et al., 2008; Aguzzi et al., 2013). One pathological feature associated with prion infection is widespread diffuse gliosis. However, the host\u2013pathogen interaction in these diseases remains incompletely understood.",

            "text": "Viral and bacterial pathogens induce various immunological responses in the host to eliminate foreign pathogens from the body. Because the amino acid sequence of PrPSc is identical to that of PrPC, which is encoded by a host gene, the host immune system was initially thought not to recognize the prion pathogen (Aguzzi and Polymenidou, 2004). However, accumulated evidence has shown that prion infection stimulates pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-related molecules and related signalling pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), and some cytokines (Prinz et al., 2003; Spinner et al., 2008; Bradford and Mabbott, 2012; Ishibashi et al., 2012a; Nuvolone et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2016). We have also reported that IRF3, which upregulates type I interferon (I-IFN) in various cell types, including neurons, plays a role in host defence against prion infection (Ishibashi et al., 2012a, b), and that persistent prion infection negatively regulates IRF3 via suppression of the transcription factor Octamer-binding protein-1 (Oct-1) (Homma et al., 2014a). Prions also exhibit strain diversity and reciprocal interference between strains, analogous to viral infections (Dickinson et al., 1972, 1975; Manuelidis, 1998). In addition, the levels of interferon-stimulated genes with anti-viral functions, including myxovirus resistance protein, protein kinase R, and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase, are significantly elevated at the clinical stage of prion disease in animal models (Riemer et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2004; Xiang et al., 2004; Stobart et al., 2007), suggesting that innate immunity protects the host, at least partially, against prion infection. In this study, we focused on the relationship between I-IFN and prion disease and sought to determine which interferon-stimulated gene induced by I-IFN signalling plays a direct protective role against prion invasion.",

The murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral expression vectors, pMSCV (Clontech Laboratories) plasmids, coding murine IFNAR1 (NCBI accession number: M89641.1) and Large T antigen from Simian virus 40 (NCBI accession number: NC_001669) were constructed by inserting the ORF region of each gene amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 and digested by arbitrary restriction enzymes, respectively. Lentiviral self-inactivating (SIN) vectors were kindly provided by Dr Miyoshi of the RIKEN BioResource Center (BRC), Ibaraki, Japan. CSII-CMV-MCS-IRES2-Venus plasmid coding murine IFN-\u03b2 were constructed by inserting the ORF region digested by NheI and NotI from pcDNA3.1-IFN-\u03b2-venus. Experiments using plasmids inserted with genes coding for the fluorescence protein \u2018Venus\u2019, were performed by Dr Miyawaki of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. To manufacture an insertion region for pUNO-interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-luc, the mammalian expression pUNO vector (Invivogen), which contains a strong and ubiquitous composite promoter designated EF1\u03b1/HTLV, was used. The PCR products were amplified from pTAL-luc (Promega) with specific primers for a single-round PCR or with two-round PCR (Supplementary Table 1). The PCR products were inserted into the pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and digested by XhoI and NheI after they were confirmed by sequencing. Finally, the pUNO-ISRE-luc plasmid was constructed by inserting the purified product into the ORF region of the pUNO vector.",

Clinical onset in prion disease has been defined as the presence of two or more of the following signs: greasy and/or yellowish hair, hunchback, weight loss, yellow pubic hair, ataxic gait, and non-parallel hind limbs. The prion-infected mice were sacrificed at preclinical onset [100 days post-inoculation (dpi)] and terminal stage, and the brains and spleens were removed. The right hemisphere of the brains and a part of the spleens were immediately frozen and homogenized at 20% and 10% (weight/volume) in phosphate buffered saline, for immunoblotting analysis, and total proteins were extracted by mixing the same amount of 2\u00d7 Lysis Buffer as described below. Remaining tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and pathological analysis was performed. As a negative control (mock), age- and strain-matched mice were inoculated intracerebrally or intraperitoneally with normal mouse brain homogenate.

Hence, we investigated the potential anti-prion effect of recombinant I-IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) in cell culture models. In the primary prion-challenge test IFN-\u03b2 treatment significantly suppressed PrPSc levels in persistently 22 L-prion-infected cells, and pretreated cells became resistant to 22 L-prion primary infection in a dose-dependent manner; the effect of IFN-\u03b1 at similar doses was weaker (Fig. 2A and B). Similar resistance to prion was also observed in IFN-\u03b2-overexpressing stable cell lines (58-IFN-\u03b2) (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 2A). Transient IFN-\u03b2 expression did not reduce endogenous PrPSc levels in persistently 22 L prion-infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Pre-transfection of cells with Poly I:C, which activates the innate immune system via I-IFN induction, prevented the establishment of prion infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). To evaluate efficacy of IFN-\u03b2 against prion propagation in prion infectious animal model, we performed bioassay using 22 L-prion-infected Tga20 mice with lentivirus coding Ifnb gene (LV-IFN). Lentiviral vectors were administered at 3 weeks after prion infection. LV-IFN localized in thalamus at 20 days after stereotaxic injection into Tga20 mice brain (Fig. 2E). When lentivirus carrying the mouse Ifnb gene (LV-IFN) was injected intracerebrally, PrPSc levels were significantly reduced at the terminal stage in the brain of Tga20 mice after prion inoculation (Fig. 2F). In pathological analysis, vacuolation and PrPSc deposits decreased significantly in the brains of LV-IFN\u2013treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 2B). The endogenous PrPC level did not change in response to IFN-\u03b2 overexpression in N2a-58 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2D), indicating that IFN-\u03b2 might prevent new PrPSc production at the early phase of primary prion infection without affecting PrPC expression.\n",

Susceptibility to 22 L prion infection was remarkably higher in immortalized MEF cells from Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice than in MEF cells from wild-type mice. Prions were dose-dependently propagated in both MEF cells. IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs showed significantly higher sensitivity to prion infection with 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22121 % 22 L-brain homogenate than MEFs from wild-type (Fig. 3A). Next, we generated Ifnar1-transduced Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells, which were rescued by delivering the Ifnar1 gene to Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with an MSCV retroviral vector, and investigated the efficiency of prion infection in an ex vivo model. The PrPC level was similar between Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs rescued by delivering the Ifnar1 gene with an MSCV retroviral vector, but the latter cells were significantly and continuously less susceptible to 22 L prion infection (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 3A and B). To confirm whether the transduction restored IFN signalling, we performed ISRE-promoter activity analysis using the dual luciferase assay. The results indicated that the promoter activity in Ifnar1-transduced Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs after poly I:C stimulation was significantly increased (3-fold) compared with non-stimulated cells, indicating that the transduced cells recovered cell signalling function via IFNAR1 whereas Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs did not possess this signalling pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3C). To elucidate the relationship between I-IFN dependent signalling pathways and prion infection in vivo, we inoculated 22 L prion into wild-type and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice and monitored prion pathogenesis. When mice were challenged intracerebrally with a 10\u22121 dilution of 22 L prion brain homogenate, the survival periods of Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly shorter (145 \u00b1 5 days, n = 15; P = 0.0006, Log-rank test) than those of the wild-type mice (153 \u00b1 8 days, n = 17) (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Furthermore, all groups of IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice inoculated with 10\u22122 dilution i.c., or 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 dilution i.p., also exhibited significantly shortened survival (Table 1). To confirm pathogenesis in IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice after prion inoculation, we performed immunoblotting to examine the PrPSc levels in the brain and spleen at 100 dpi and at the terminal stage. The PrPSc levels in the brain and spleen of Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice were similar into those of wild-type mice (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 3D). However, vacuolation and gliosis with microglia (marker: IBA1) and astrocytes (marker: GFAP) were significantly more severe than in wild-type mice. In addition, accumulation of PrPSc in some regions at 100 dpi was considerably more severe in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4C, D and Supplementary Fig. 3E). Taken together, these findings indicate that the I-IFN signalling pathway via I-IFN receptor, including IFNAR1, protects to some degree against prion infection.\n",

The reported functional mechanism of RO8191 is selective binding to the I-IFN receptor and the sequential induction of many interferon-stimulated genes, followed by the activation of I-IFN signalling (Konishi et al., 2012).

PrPSc levels in N2a-22 L cells treated with RO8191 were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (0.5, 5, 50, 250 and 500 \u03bcM RO8191) (Fig. 5A). However, PrPC levels in N2a-58 cells treated with RO8191 showed no change (Fig. 5B). In both cells, the level of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase 1a (OAS1a), encoded by an interferon-stimulated gene, was dose-dependently increased by RO8191 treatment. Moreover, we investigated the potential anti-prion effect of RO8191 in cell culture models. RO8191 pretreated cells became resistant to 22 L-prion primary infection with the increase in expression of OAS1a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C), suggesting that RO8191, which induces interferon-stimulated genes via I-IFN signalling during the innate immune response, might prevent the establishment of prion infection without affecting PrPC expression. Next, to evaluate the efficacy of RO8191 against prion propagation in a prion infectious animal model, we performed a bioassay using prion-infected mice. The ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with 10% 22 L prion brain homogenate were intraperitoneally administered 2 mg/kg/day RO8191 three times a week from 2 days post-inoculation until sacrifice. The survival periods of RO8191-treated mice were significantly longer (165 \u00b1 7 days, n = 8; P = 0.0123, Log-rank test) than those of the vehicle mice (156 \u00b1 4 days, n = 7) (Fig. 6A). Changes in the body weight of each group were consistent with prolonged survival times. The changes in body weight of the RO8191 group gently decreased compared with those of vehicle group, and this was delayed by about 2 weeks. RO8191-treated mice were observed for toxicity due to chronic administration and the symptoms of prion disease were similar to those of the vehicle mice (Supplementary Fig. 4A). We analysed PrPSc and histological changes in the brains of mice at 100 dpi, which was the time point before disease onset. PrPSc levels in the RO8191-treated brains and spleens were significantly less (50% reduction) than in the vehicle-treated brains at 100 dpi. PrPSc suppression in the spleens of RO8191-treated mice was observed until the terminal stage (Fig. 6B). RO8191 treatment significantly inhibited the levels of vacuolation and PrPSc deposition in some regions, including the cortex and spleen, compared with vehicle treatment at 100 dpi. Likewise, we also evaluated gliosis levels in the brains of RO8191-treated mice at 100 dpi. At 100 dpi, RO8191 treatment significantly reduced the expression of Iba-1 and GFAP, which are markers of activated microglia and astrocytes, in multiple regions of the cortex, thalamus and pons. However, RO8191 treatment resulted in no changes in expression in any of the regions at terminal phase (Fig. 6C, D and Supplementary Fig. 4B). These results indicate that RO8191 might have the potential to suppress prion formation in several tissues of the body following exogenous prion infection.\n",

Moreover, to confirm the levels of RO8191 in the tissues of the animal model, we measured the concentration of RO8191 in the brains and spleens of prion-infected mice with RO8191 treatment at 100 dpi and the terminal stage. The concentrations of RO8191 in the brains and spleens of cured mice at 100 dpi were confirmed to be high 8.44 \u00b1 2.1 and 86.46 \u00b1 62.54 \u00b5g/g of tissue, respectively, and these concentrations were maintained at the terminal stage (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that RO8191 might be able to act specifically on the brain and spleen, the organs mainly responsible for establishing prion formation.\n",

            "text": "Prion infection suppressed Ifnb gene expression in 22 L-prion infected cells, and the level of Ifnb expression recovered following reduction of PrPSc by treatment with anti-prion compound and antibody (Fig. 1). This suppression of Ifnb gene transcription was followed by the low expression of IRF3 via a reduction of Oct-1 after prion infection (Homma et al., 2014a). Notably, Tlr3, Ddx58/RIGI, Ifih1/MDA5 and Irf7, which are innate immune genes of the upstream signalling pathway relating to I-IFN induction, were suppressed by prion infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). IRF3 can contribute to the regulation of gene expression not only for Ifnb but also for Ifih1/MDA5 (Yount et al., 2007). TLR3 (Heinz et al., 2003), IRF1 (Choi et al., 2009) and IRF7 (Farlik et al., 2012) are evoked by STAT1 and NF\u03baB is activated by intracellular signalling in response to IFN-\u03b2 stimuli. Moreover, IRF1 is a transcription factor that positively regulates RIGI expression in human cells (Su et al., 2007). These studies indicate that prion infection might result in a dysfunctional immune system following the suppression of the expression of several genes by IRF3 reduction because type I IFN signalling mediated by IRF3 is closely connected with the regulation of expression of several innate immunity-related genes. However, the mechanism of action has not yet been determined and needs to be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "Although we found that IFN expression remained unchanged in the brains of prion-infected mice during the terminal period, it has been reported that the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes was increased in the brains of prion-infected animals (Riemer et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 2004; Stobart et al., 2007). Similarly, the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes was remarkably increased in the glial cells of the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Baker et al., 2004). However, it remains unclear whether IFN gene expression is increased in ex vivo and in vivo prion-infected models at an early phase. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether IFN in the host plays a protective role against prion pathogen infection. In our experiments, prion infection suppressed IFN expression in prion-infected cells (Fig. 1) and low IFN expression levels were recovered by a reduction of PrPSc (Fig. 1). Furthermore, pretreatment with IFN and IFN system stimuli inhibited the new establishment of prion infection (Fig. 2), indicating that the host might combat prion propagation using any defence system available, including IFN. Thus, it will be necessary to investigate IFN induction at an early phase in neurons after prion infection. I-IFN stimulates various cell types, including immune cells such as lymphocytes, glia, and neurons (Delhaye et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2007). Intriguingly, I-IFN is constitutively expressed at low levels even in the absence of pathogens and contributes to the regulation of tumour propagation and cell growth (Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001). Dysfunction of TLR4 and IRF3 facilitate prion pathogenesis (Spinner et al., 2008; Ishibashi et al., 2012a), suggesting that this process might be negatively regulated by signalling pathways, including I-IFN, that act downstream of PRRs. Pretreatment with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant and unmethylated CpG DNA to activate TLR signalling delays clinical onset in mice after prion inoculation (Sethi et al., 2002; Tal et al., 2003). Furthermore, glial cells pretreated with poly I:C are strongly resistant to prion infection (Kang et al., 2016), but post-treatment does not protect against prion pathogenesis in mice (Worthington, 1972; Cunningham et al., 2005; Field et al., 2010). Here, we showed that I-IFN signalling mediated by IFNAR1 suppressed prion pathogenesis in cell culture and mouse models after prion inoculation. Although persistent infection by 22 L prion decreased expression of innate immunity genes such as Irf3 and Ifnb in an ex vivo system (Homma et al., 2014a), I-IFN protected against primary prion infection in cells (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that I-IFN, induced by TLR signalling, exerts a crucial anti-prion effect in the early phase after prion infection. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6, which are induced following stimulation of PRR such as TLR4, may contribute to the acceleration of prion infection as determined by a prion bioassay using gene-deficient mice (Thackray et al., 2004; Tamguney et al., 2008). However, the relationship between suppression and I-IFN signalling has yet to be determined.",

            "text": "Using quantitative high-throughput screening, RO8191 was identified as a novel small molecule that acts like I-IFNs by directly interacting with the I-IFN receptor to drive interferon-stimulated gene expression. RO8191 can positively bind to the IFNAR2 receptor and strongly evoke an IFN signal inducing interferon-stimulated gene expression (Konishi et al., 2012). Thus, RO8191 can markedly block hepatitis C virus replication and cell death after encephalomyocarditis virus infection in cell culture as demonstrated with recombinant IFN treatment (Konishi et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015). Moreover, mice orally inoculated with RO8191 showed significantly higher expression of several interferon-stimulated genes compared with the vehicle group (Konishi et al., 2012). RO8191 inhibited PrPSc in prion-infected cells but did not change the PrPC level (Fig. 5). Prion-infected mice that were intraperitoneally treated with RO8191 showed significantly prolonged survival periods and were resistant to pathological changes in the brain after prion infection (Fig. 6). Several low molecular weight compounds (NPRs), which provide stabilization of protein structure by binding to PrPC and inhibit conversion to PrPSc, suppressed the prion pathology in prion-infected mice following intraperitoneal chronic treatment. Several NPRs were linked with significantly reduced PrPSc levels only in persistently prion-infected cells, with no effect on PrPC levels (Ishibashi et al., 2016). This implies that NPRs may show medical efficacy in peripheral areas such as the spleen, resulting in delayed PrPSc synthesis and accumulation in the brain. However, it remains to be clarified whether NPR acts in the brain. In our experiments, RO8191 was detected in high concentration in the brain and spleen of prion-infected mice at 100 dpi and at terminal phase. RO8191 showed high blood\u2013brain barrier permeability in an in vitro system compared with the control (Fig. 7), indicating that RO8191 might block prion propagation by acting in not only peripheral tissues but also in the brain. Furthermore, RO8191-treated mice did not have a shortened life span or show changes in phenotype, such as rapid weight loss from the side effects, after continuous treatment (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4A), suggesting that the compound may be safe for clinical application.",

Although we do not yet know exactly how host cells can recognize the prion pathogen, which lacks its own genetic material, the IFR3\u2013IFN pathway serves as an important line of defence. Interference with this pathway permits persistent prion infection. The reciprocal interaction between innate host immunity and invading prions may explain the long latency of prion diseases. I-IFN and TLR signalling have diverse functions, including activation of autophagic systems that promote degradation of \u03b1-synuclein-derived aggregations (Ejlerskov et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015) and contribute to neuronal homeostasis (Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001). Therefore, effects of I-IFN should be considered in further investigations. Elucidating the role of host immunity in prion diseases could facilitate development of novel therapeutics for this deadly disease.",
