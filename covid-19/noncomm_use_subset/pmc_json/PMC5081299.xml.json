An indicator of the burden of disease, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), is a combination of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) (2). According to the Global burden of disease (GBD) group, the proportion of DALYs for communicable diseases decreased in Korea from 1990 (9.29%) to 2010 (6.48%). Globally, the proportion of DALYs for communicable disease also decreased from 1990 (46.9%) to 2010 (33.5%) (3). Experts have predicted that the DALYs of communicable disease will decrease globally to 20% in 2030. But the volume of DALYs due to communicable diseases will decrease in developing countries, the volume in high-income countries will remain similar to the present level (4). A 2010 GBD study reported that the proportion of DALYs from communicable diseases in developing countries decreased from 53.7% in 1990 to 38.7% in 2010; however, in high-income regions the reduction was much less, from 7.4% in 1990 to 5.7% in 2010 (3). The communicable disease would be still substantial burden in the future.",

This indicates that people with lower socioeconomic status had a higher incidence of communicable diseases than people with higher socioeconomic status. Therefore, they suggested that communicable diseases were a major public health problem in high-income countries like New Zealand (5). Lim et al. (6) also proposed that socioeconomic inequality could affect the increasing incidence of communicable diseases in other developed countries. Thus, these results show that the control of communicable disease poses a new challenge in developed countries, including Korea.",

            "text": "The substantial burden of communicable diseases requires a reconsideration of policy that acknowledges socioeconomic differences in Korea. Communicable diseases still represent a substantial proportion of the burden of disease in Korea. In 2012, among roughly 45,765,000 people, an estimated 10,672,000 people visited the hospital due to communicable diseases (ICD code; A00\u2013B99) (7). Besides, 7,106 deaths were attributed to communicable diseases (8). In addition, some communicable diseases influence the incidence of non-communicable diseases, and the prevalence of some types of these communicable diseases is higher in Korea. For example, in individuals over 10 years old, the prevalence of hepatitis B, a risk factor for liver cancer, was 3.2%, and in individuals over 30 years old the prevalence was 4.0%, significantly higher than that of other countries such as the USA (0.4%) (9). Furthermore, some chronic communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS remain a threat to Koreans. The incidence of tuberculosis was 96 per 100,000 in 2012, the highest among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (10). Finally, emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015, have also threatened public health in Korea. In this respect, despite a decrease in the communicable disease DALYs, communicable diseases continue to affect public health.",

Therefore, a consideration of communicable diseases and the development of an intervention strategy are required to address communicable diseases in Korea at the present time. An accurate measurement of the burden of communicable diseases is of primary importance for the development of an effective intervention strategy. However, a measure of the burden of communicable disease in Korea is lacking. Yoon et al. (11) estimated DALYs of some diseases in 2000, but that study did not consider all of the communicable diseases. Also, Yoon et al. (12) estimated DALYs in 2007, but they excluded communicable diseases from their study. Therefore, to address these deficiencies, we used representative health statistics and health insurance data from 2012 to estimate DALYs and to evaluate the burden of communicable diseases in Korea.",

The total DALYs from communicable diseases were 445 per 100,000 in 2012, which consisted of 29.0% YLLs and 71.0% YLDs. The total DALYs in men were greater than that seen in women. The largest volume of total DALYs was in the 40-49 years old age group and the lowest was in the \u2265 80 years old age group. However, the \u2265 80 years old age group had the highest DALYs per 100,000, followed by the 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups. These results indicate that children and elderly people are particularly sensitive to, and at high risk for, communicable diseases. This is consistent with the findings of previous studies in other countries, such as New Zealand, where the communicable disease-related hospitalization rate for patients under 5 years of age was five times greater than that for patients in the 15-29 years old age group; in addition, the communicable disease-related hospitalization rate per 100,000 was highest in the \u2265 70 years old age group (5). In other words, children and elderly people known as vulnerable group were concentrated for communicable disease in high income region. Therefore, we need to additional study for DALY in socioeconomic perspective.",

In the case of injury, 38.2% of DALYs were from YLLs and 61.8% were from YLDs. The proportion of YLLs in DALYs was higher with injuries than that seen with communicable diseases. On the other hand, 9.2% of DALYs were from YLLs and 90.8% were from YLDs in non-communicable diseases, with the proportion of YLDs being larger than that seen in communicable diseases (13). These results demonstrate that most of the burden of communicable diseases is due to disability rather than premature death. When compared with non-communicable disease, however, the importance of premature death is higher in communicable disease. Therefore, a strategy focusing on minimizing YLL warrants attention.",

While the volume of total DALYs was largest in the 50-59 years old age group, the DALYs per 100,000 were highest in the \u2265 80 years old age group. The mortality and incidence rates of tuberculosis in Korea per 100,000 were the highest among the OECD countries in 2012 and significantly higher than that of the next closest country, Portugal (10). In particular, the YLLs for tuberculosis were the highest and accounted for 33.7% of communicable disease YLLs in Korea. Because mortality due to tuberculosis is considered an avoidable death, appropriate health policy intervention and high quality health care, such as primary diagnostic test for HIV patients and management of drug supplies and timely treatment, could prevent many tuberculosis related deaths (1819). Therefore, a strategy to minimize deaths due to tuberculosis should be undertaken to minimize the burden of tuberculosis. For example, adoption of the WHO Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) therapy, a 6 month antituberculosis drug treatment program, would be a cost-effective intervention. For example, the DOTS program had a tuberculosis treatment rate of 86% globally in 2013 (20).",
