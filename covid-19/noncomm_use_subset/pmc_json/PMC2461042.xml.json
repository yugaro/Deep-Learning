A good example is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus, which first appeared in the human population in late 2002 and eventually infected \u223c8000 people with a 10% fatality rate (WHO, 2003). Today, the avian influenza H5N1 virus poses a significant threat if effective human\u2013human transmission develops, with the potential risk of a Spanish flu-like pandemic (Juckett, 2006; Tellier, 2006; Thomas and Noppenberger, 2007). The emergence of these viruses and other biothreat agents has raised world concerns for their use in biowarfare/bioterrorism and demonstrates the vulnerability of society to biological threats.",

            "text": "Traditionally, protection from pathogens can be achieved by either active or passive immunization. Active immunization in which a vaccine is administered to elicit a protective immune response is generally the desired therapeutic goal. Unfortunately, vaccine development can be slow and expensive, and in the case of biothreat agent vaccines, often fail to have the marketability to attract commercial research and development funding. Passive immunization where specific antibodies are administered is a viable alternative and provides immediate and protective immunity (Casadevall, 2002). In sudden and unexpected terrorist attacks, the immediacy of the protection provided from passive, protective antibodies is especially important. Because the half-life of human serum immunoglobulin is \u223c20 days, passive immunization could provide an effective countermeasure against such biological weapons (Casadevall, 2002). The challenge then lies in being able to rapidly respond to these biological insults with the generation of specific antibodies.",

Many organizations involved in this work either focus on the discovery of novel antibodies and subsequently, outsource necessary optimization efforts or vice versa. In contrast, we utilized technology that comprehensively encompasses both the discovery and optimization components of producing therapeutic antibodies. In addition to eliminating potential coordination issues between organizations, this centralized effort can reduce timelines. Using SARS-CoV as the model system, we have discovered, humanized, and optimized the functional performance of novel neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS infection in permissive cells and viral replication in vivo. These discovery and evolution strategies will potentially be useful in reducing the current susceptibility to biological threats.",

The inhaled dose was 293 pfu based on the concentration of the virus in the aerosol and the predicted volume of air that each mouse inhaled in 10 min. On day 3 following the challenge, mice were sacrificed and the lungs removed for analysis. Lung homogenates were tested for presence of virus by plaque assay on Vero cells.

In fact, as all heavy chains have the chance to interact with all light chains, this method can provide even greater diversity than found in mice. After screening an immunized mouse library for antibodies against the spike protein, three antibodies were isolated that inhibited infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. This library was recovered from three immunized mice that had been paired with three additional mice immunized with the same virus on the same schedule. The other three mice had significantly higher serum antibody titers against SARS-CoV and were used to generate antibodies following the traditional hybridoma approach. Although the analysis of the hybridomas was conducted solely with the SARS virus rather than with the spike protein alone, it is interesting to note that no neutralizing antibodies were found using the hybridoma approach (data not shown) while multiple neutralizing antibodies were found using DNA display.",

Despite significant successes, there are some limitations to this approach. For example, fusion to phage proteins or other aspects of phage display may interfere with the binding properties of the protein of interest. As well, multi-subunit proteins are more difficult to screen by phage display. Finally, phage display proteins are transported to the cell surface, where the in vitro environment might not be suitable for some protein\u2013protein interactions.

The in vitro screen allows for a high-throughput analysis of complex libraries with great diversity. For in vivo production, we made functional Fabs in specific E. coli redox strains that allowed the proper intracellular environment for Fab production at sufficient concentrations to perform a screen. The Fab was produced as a fusion of a zinc finger to the Fab heavy chain. The opposite construction with the light chain fused to the zinc finger resulted in a lower level of enrichment (data not shown). The heavy chain alone is known to be insoluble (Davies and Riechmann, 1994) and thus, we postulate that the fusion with the zinc finger, in combination with the proper oxidizing environment, could make the heavy chain soluble long enough to pair with the light chain (the light/heavy chain binding results in a soluble Fab). Due to the intracellular production of the targeted protein during DNA display, broad applications for a variety of protein-based interactions are possible. One could use the method to probe any protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions in vivo, unlike a phage display screen. As well, because the proteins are produced in vivo, they could have access to chaperones that allow proper folding. Furthermore, DNA display is simpler than phage display in that there is no need to make a phage preparation and the entire library can be screened in about half the time (\u223c1.5 days compared to three days).",

Unfortunately, both approaches do not guarantee that the CDRs are presented in the same conformation as in the WT antibody.

It is also possible that there has been a change in the fine specificity of the antibody binding to the spike protein. Studies with neutralizing cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B-specific antibodies have shown that with only small sequence changes, antibodies can demonstrate a wide variety of neutralization capacities that do not strictly correlate with their affinities (Ohlin et al., 1996; Lantto et al., 2003; Barrios et al., 2007). These differences in neutralization are attributed to small changes in their fine specificities and are observed even when the sequence changes are derived from the same clonotype.",

The screen itself requires \u223c1.5 days per round and together with the initial construction of the antibody library and confirmation of candidate hits in the ELISAs, discovery of new antibodies can be accomplished within approximately three weeks. If optimization of the antibody is necessary, both the GSSM\u2122 and HuFR\u2122 technology require 10\u201312 weeks each from the initial construction of the library to the confirmed hits.
