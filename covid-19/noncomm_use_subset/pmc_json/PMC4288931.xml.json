There have also been descriptions of discrete, cyclic lmwPEG analogues improving protein stability and aggregation behavior.7 Furthermore, cyclic carbohydrates, such as cyclodextrins, have also been shown to inhibit protein aggregation by interacting with exposed hydrophobic patches.8 Calixarenes, on the other hand, are much more hydrophobic, but similarly cyclic, cation-binding molecules. They have been used to camouflage protein surfaces by their binding to lysine side chains, and thus it has also been suggested that they may promote crystallization.9 Recently, protein complexes with molecular tweezers have been structurally characterized.10 These small molecules feature a belt-like electron-rich molecular cavity with negative charges, which promote complexation with lysines and arginines. Although molecular tweezers do affect protein activity, there is currently no information on their effects on protein crystallizability. A different, chemically sophisticated method based on foldamers has also been recently proposed to improve crystallization.11 The need to specifically tailor foldamers towards the target protein, however, may limit the widespread use of this technology.",

LmwPEGs show two distinct conformational types: linear lmwPEGs presenting an extended conformation, and ring-shaped lmwPEGs with a configuration similar to the CR structure. In the latter type, they often form Van der Waals (VdW) contacts with aromatic or aliphatic residues (Figure 1), or they coordinate primary amines (lysine) or guanidinium moieties (arginine) (Figure 1 b). Further, our bio-informatic studies indicated that 68 % of all ring-shaped lmwPEGs, but only 58 % of linear PEGs, mediated protein\u2013protein contacts in the crystal. These observations suggested that CRs with similar physico-chemical properties to lmwPEGs (Figure 1 d) may be more constrained and therefore better chelators and VdW partners to protein surfaces.",

DMP19 is a DNA mimic protein13 and was chosen because there is no published information on DMP19\u2013lmwPEG interactions. Most published structures of the peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase mutant Pin1R14A14, 15 contain a tightly bound ring-shaped lmwPEG molecule which might be required for crystallization. Finally, we included RbmA (Rugosity and Biofilm structure Modulator A), a biofilm scaffolding protein, as a positive control. In previous studies, we showed that CR was tightly bound by RbmA with a 1:1 stoichiometry.16 We performed the experiments in the presence of various concentrations of CR, or PEG400 (Table 1). The higher PEG400 concentrations destabilized Pin1R14A, but CR did not cause any changes in Pin1R14A behavior (Table 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1). The DMP19 experiments, however, produced the opposite results, with CR causing destabilization and PEG400 having no effect on the protein melting temperature (Table 1). This was also the case for RbmA (Table 1), agreeing with our previous work on this protein.16 These results suggest that DMP19 might complex CR in a similarly tight fashion, whereas there was no perceptible CR binding of Pin1R14A in solution. On the other hand, lmwPEGs only affected Pin1R14A stability, suggesting a tight binding to Pin1R14A.",

We complemented these with a variable number of commercial screens, each containing conditions in which the corresponding protein was known to crystallize (Supporting Information, Table S1). To further verify our conclusions, we expanded our test set with five readily available proteins, hemoglobin, the SARS-CoV 3CL protease, lysozyme, myoglobin, and trypsin. (Table 2; Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2). Conditions in which the protein crystallized only in the absence or presence of 18-crown-6, but not in both, were defined as unique hits.

The structure revealed a new dimeric form containing a total of six CR molecules, thus confirming that CR does indeed complex tightly with DMP19 (Figure 2 a, 3 a and b). Furthermore, CR caused \u03b1-helices 1 and 2 to rotate by 179 degrees relative to the apo-structure (Figure 2 b). This change in conformation produced a hydrophobic channel containing one central and two lateral C-crowns (C-crownd and C-crowns b and c, respectively; Figure 2 a; Supporting Information, Figure S6). The central C-crown interacted with a network of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids from both polypeptide chains, including L27, Y53, and Y74 (Figure 2 a and 3 b). The interaction resulted in a pseudo two-fold axis, orthogonal to the channel, with identical contacts for each of the lateral C-crowns. Each of the lateral C-crowns interacted with just one polypeptide chain by D43, Y74, R77, and P79 (Figure 2 a; Supporting Information, Figure S6). A further surface C-crown in a distinct pocket was also involved in the dimer interface, contacting E73, and Y103 of both chains (C-crowna in Figure 2 a and Supporting Information, Figure S6). Two equivalent K-crowns were present on the surface of the DMP19 dimer, interacting with K125 (Figure 2 a and 3 a), and mediating crystal contacts across the unit cell (Supporting Information, Figure S5). As the native dimeric state of DMP19 is the active conformation,13 we suggest that CR may interfere with DMP19 function by altering its tertiary and quaternary structure, much in the manner of molecular tweezers and supramolecular complexes.10",

Symmetry operations yielded a unit cell in which each Pin1R14A monomer interacted with two crystallographically equivalent pairs of CRs. Of these, two CRs did not interact strongly with the protein (Figure 2 c). Furthermore, three Pin1R14A molecules contributed to the binding of each pair of CRs, resulting in a sealed chamber.

However, these two ring-shaped portions of PEG400 are orthogonal to each other and hence do not stack. We suggest that the major factor responsible for the apparent lack of in-solution Pin1R14A\u22c5CR complexes is the difficulty in producing a 3:2 protein\u22c5CR complex compared to a 1:1 Pin1R14A\u22c5PEG400 complex. Within the crystal lattice, however, the protein\u22c5CR interaction must be more stable and thus contribute significantly to crystal growth by favoring crystal contacts. Therefore, a dramatic change in Pin1R14A binding affinity for CR between the solution and crystalline phases is to be expected. As testing binding affinities directly in crystals is challenging, we studied the relative stabilities of the Pin1R14A\u22c5CR and Pin1R14A\u22c5lmwPEG complexes via molecular dynamics simulations. We simulated the P3121 Pin1R14A crystals in the presence and absence of CRs and lmwPEGs (Supporting Information, Figure S7 and Videos S1\u2013S6).

In the crystal simulations, CRs also appeared to stabilize K97 and K117 (Supporting Information, Table S5), which are both part of the protein\u2013protein crystal interface. LmwPEGs, however, fully stabilized only K117, and simulation of Pin1R14A\u22c5PEG complexes in solution resulted in stable binding. We therefore suggest that, at least in the case of Pin1R14A, and quite possibly in the case of hemoglobin, CR acts as an effective crystallization agent by stabilizing lysine side chains (Supporting Information, Figure S8). The capacity of CRs to stack, weakening protein\u2013protein repulsive forces, appears to make them ideal additives that can help overcome the phase transition barrier between the solvated and crystalline protein states. Further, CRs appear to have a greater specificity towards lysines and hydrophobic patches, than other additives,17 which suggests they may be useful as a less time-consuming alternative to systematic lysine mutagenesis.18 Interestingly, other crown-like compounds, such as macrocyclic amines, have been reported to bind terminal carboxylic acids.19 Perhaps these crowns might be able to act on glutamate and aspartate in the same way CRs do on lysines.",

Different protein chains are colored in gray, green, and purple. Chains within an asymmetric unit are capitalized, while crystallographic equivalents are marked with an asterisk (*). d) Top: PEG200 in its linear conformation. PEG200 was bound by 2PLR. Bottom: 18-crown-6 ether is a circular molecule, which is strikingly similar to ring-shaped PEG200. Molecular weights and formulas are taken from Pubchem (CID 62551 for PEG200, and CID 28557 for 18-crown-6).",

Four C-crowns (C-crowna-d) and two K-crowns (K-crowna and K-crownb), in purple, bind each DMP19 dimer (green and blue). The Fo\u2212Fc omit maps of the CRs (orange) were calculated for each CR and contoured at a 1.5 \u03c3 level. \u03b11 and \u03b12 stand for \u03b1-helices 1 and 2. b) Comparison of the monomers of the published DMP19 structure (3VJZ, in blue) and the DMP19\u22c5CR complex (cyan). While 73.6 % of the structure remains practically unchanged (rmsd 0.95 over 108 common C\u03b1 atoms), the region between the N-terminus and \u03b1-helix 2 changes dramatically, rotating by 179 degrees. The rotated elements are shown as cylinder diagrams, with \u03b11, \u03b12, and Y26 corresponding to 3VJZ, and \u03b11\u2032, \u03b12\u2032, and Y26\u2032 to the DMP19\u22c5CR complex. c) Ribbon diagram of Pin1R14A\u22c5CR complex. Two CRs (K- and C-crown) and protein residues interacting with them are shown as stick models (purple, and yellow, respectively). Symmetry related CRs (K- and C-crown*) are shown in green. e) Crystal packing of Pin1R14A and CRs. Six Pin1R14A molecules are shown in different colors in the unit cell. The CRs are presented as sphere diagrams with carbon atoms in purple.",
