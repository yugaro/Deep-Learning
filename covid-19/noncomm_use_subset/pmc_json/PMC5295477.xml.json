            "text": "Since the efficacy of transferring patients with severe respiratory failure to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) center was first reported, the safe and timely transfer of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has attracted increasing attention [1]. ECMO is being used more frequently as a treatment for severe ARDS, and the need for ECMO in transit has increased [2]. In particular, during the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, ECMO interhospital transport played a significant role in patients requiring transfer to an ECMO center for ARDS treatment. However, South Korea still lacks a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system due to limited resources. Recent advances in ECMO have suggested that ECMO can function as an alternative to a ventilator for oxygenation. ECMO without mechanical ventilation has been used in a number of ARDS patients. In view of this, we have greatly simplified our ECMO transport system and have been operating our ECMO interhospital transport program without the use of mechanical ventilation [3]. During the planning stage of our ECMO transport program, our goal was to maximize the utilization of hospital staff and facilities and to develop an ECMO transport system using the public emergency medical services (EMS) systems. Our system was specifically designed to address the medical circumstances in South Korea and can be appropriately applied to other hospitals in South Korea. In this study, we review our experiences using an interhospital ECMO transport program without mechanical ventilation in a resource-limited environment.",

The transport range was determined as the area where interhospital transport was feasible within 4 hours, the duration of capacity for the electrical power supply of available ambulances and the loading capacity of O2 tanks. Since our hospital neither owned nor operated an ambulance, we designed our transport system to utilize the 119 existing EMS or private ambulance services (Fig. 1). The transport team consisted of specialists capable of solving mechanical problems pertinent to ECMO, as well as treating episodes of cardiac arrest that can occur during emergency transport. The team included 2 thoracic surgeons, 2 clinical perfusionists with nursing experience, and 1 ambulance driver.",

For patients with respiratory failure and hypotension, VA ECMO or veno-veno-arterial ECMO was performed. In VV ECMO, the right femoral vein was used for venous drainage and the right internal jugular vein was used for venous return. In VA ECMO, the right femoral vein and left femoral artery were utilized. Cannulation was performed using the Seldinger technique under ultrasonic guidance. The most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA). The EBS Emergency Bypass System ECMO machine (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used in 7 patients and the Quadrox PLS ECMO machine (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) was used in the other 11 patients. The cannulas were tightly fixed to the patient\u2019s body to prevent decannulation during transport. Once ECMO was initiated, ECMO flow and O2 flow were adjusted to determine the ECMO support flow required for transport. Ventilator settings were gradually lowered over 1 hour to maintain a partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) >70 mm Hg, partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) <50 mm Hg, and a saturation of peripheral O2 (SpO2) >95% at a fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.4, PEEP of 5 mm Hg, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Once a stable ECMO flow was established, transport was deemed feasible.",

At that point, the charge status of the ECMO machine was checked and the gas flow line was connected to a portable O2 tank. The patient\u2019s arterial blood pressure, SpO2, and heart rate were monitored with a portable vital sign monitor, and the patient was transported from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the ambulance on the ambulance bed. Upon arriving in the ambulance, the ECMO machine was connected to the power inside the vehicle and the O2 line was connected to the ambulance O2 tank flow line. The patient\u2019s status was observed constantly by monitoring vital signs and by visually verifying the blood color in the inflow and outflow lines. If the SpO2 dropped below 90%, the O2 tank level in the ambulance was verified and the endotracheal tube status was checked. The SpO2 was maintained above 90% by adjusting the ECMO and O2 inhalation flow. When the SpO2 of patients was lower than 90%, the PaO2, PaCO2, and pH were checked by arterial blood gas analysis using the I-stat (Abbott). When the ambulance arrived at the hospital, the patient was transported to the ICU in the same manner as during the departure, and mechanical ventilation was begun immediately. In addition, the patient continued to be monitored for hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Any necessary X-ray examinations or laboratory tests were conducted and all problems were addressed accordingly.",

We initially thought that a province would be appropriate as the transport range of our transport system due to the accessibility and utilization of medical services. Ultimately, we defined the range of ECMO transport as the area within 100 km of our hospital, and that transportation by ambulance would be the most appropriate method. Although a helicopter has the advantage of more rapid patient transport, night operation is difficult and patients would still need to be transported by ambulance to the helicopter landing area since referring hospitals do not have facilities to accommodate the use of helicopters. Additionally, helicopter transport would be extremely costly within the transport distance of 100 km. Therefore, transport by ambulance was clearly the most appropriate and cost-effective choice.",

With \u2018awake ECMO,\u2019 patients with respiratory failure are treated with ECMO alone without a mechanical ventilator [8,9]. When ECMO is performed, sufficient amounts of O2 are supplied and CO2 is removed by ECMO. The notable capacity of the ECMO oxygenator for removing CO2 maintains the target blood CO2 without mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. Therefore, patients using ECMO can maintain appropriate blood concentrations of O2 and CO2 without mechanical ventilation as long as blood flow and gas flow are well maintained. In this context, we are able to operate our interhospital transport system without a mechanical ventilator as long as ECMO flow is sufficiently maintained. In our experience, ECMO transport with Ambu-bag ventilation has been feasible in patients with respiratory failure. We have identified no difficulty in maintaining proper blood O2 and CO2 concentrations during transport.",
