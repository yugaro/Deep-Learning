            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses. Over the last decades, several animal CoVs have been identified, including major pathogens such as the bovine CoV and the avian infectious bronchitis virus. Two human CoVs (hCoVs) termed hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E have been known since the 1960s, causing mild respiratory disease (1). In 2002/2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) leading to over 700 deaths was caused by a novel hCoV termed SARS-CoV (2, 3). In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, two additional hCoVs termed hCoV-NL63 and -HKU1 as well as numerous novel bat-associated CoVs were described (4\u20137). CoVs have been reclassified into four genera designated Alphacoronavirus (former groups 1a and 1b), Betacoronavirus (groups 2a to 2d), Gammacoronavirus (group 3), and as recently suggested, Deltacoronavirus (8). A likely animal reservoir for SARS-CoV has been identified in bats (7, 9\u201311). Nevertheless, bat-derived CoVs have never been isolated in cell culture. Prototypic CoVs, including the SARS-CoV, are almost unculturable in bat-derived cell lines (11, 12). Double infections of bats with different CoVs are very rare (13), and bat CoVs appear to be restricted to their bat hosts at the genus level (14, 15). These points taken together suggest that there is a tight barrier against CoV host switching, preventing humans from acquiring novel CoVs easily (1, 11).",

The cellular and anatomic localization of ACE2 in the human body had an important meaning for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of SARS. The receptor is expressed on pneumocytes deep in the human lung, but hardly in the upper parts of the respiratory tract (17). The direct targeting of pneumocytes may explain why SARS-CoV infection led to a severe clinical picture with early onset of respiratory distress in affected patients. The focusing of SARS-CoV replication to the deep respiratory tract also determined a major hallmark of SARS epidemiology. Because the virus needed to reach the deep respiratory tract to seed an infection, the infectious dose was rather high. Once infected, primary replication in the deep lung rapidly caused severe clinical symptoms leading to early hospitalization and thus, isolation, before patients could develop high virus concentrations in respiratory secretions. These factors taken together are thought to have limited the spread of SARS-CoV in the human population.",

The disease involved severe acute respiratory failure but as an additional component affected the kidneys, causing acute renal failure (18, 19). A novel betacoronavirus was isolated from one of two patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and termed hCoV-EMC (also named hCoV-EMC/2012) (10, 20). Another case originating from Qatar was transferred to London, United Kingdom, for treatment (18, 19). Very recently, a third case was reported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, suggesting that more cases are to be expected (21). Availability of a virus isolate enables rapid provisional assessments of virus properties in order to guess at virus origins and project epidemic risks. Because of the taxonomic placement of hCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV as sister clades within the same virus genus, we were interested in rapidly assessing any possible overlaps in receptor usage (18, 20).",

The derived RoNi/7-hACE2 cells appeared slightly more permissive for hCoV-EMC, but by performing antibody competition experiments, the possibility that this difference was due to the presence of hACE2 in RoNi/7-hACE2 cells was excluded, as SARS-CoV infection was blocked by anti-hACE2 antibody, and hCoV-EMC infection was not (Fig. 2C).",

Because hCoV-EMC was most closely related to bat CoV HKU5 detected in bats of the genus Pipistrellus (18, 20, 23), we generated two different kidney cell lines from the European bat species Pipistrellus pipistrellus as well as a kidney cell line from another European vespertilionid bat species, Myotis daubentonii (MyDauNi/2). A New World bat cell line from the species Carollia perspicillata (CarNi/1) was made, and a permanent cell line from Rhinolophus landeri lung cells was included to represent the bat genus associated with SARS-related CoV. Porcine kidney cells (PS) were tested to represent a larger range of laurasiatherian mammals, and a human kidney cancer cell line (769-P) was included to complement the tested range of primate cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, all of the bat cell lines were readily infected by hCoV-EMC (lower panel) but not by SARS-CoV (upper panel). Porcine and human kidney cell lines were infected by both coronaviruses (Fig. 2B). In summary, hCoV-EMC was able to infect cells from four major families of bats covering the whole diversity of this large mammalian order (Pteropodidae [Rousettus], Rhinolophidae [Rhinolophus], Vespertilionidae [Pipistrellus, Myotis], Phyllostomidae [Carollia]). Replication in porcine and primate cells suggests an even broader tropism across mammals.",

            "text": "Large parts of the epidemiology and pathology of SARS were related to its receptor tropism in humans (3, 11, 16). In a scenario resembling that for avian influenza viruses, the anatomical position of the receptor in the deep respiratory tract and the downregulation of its expression were postulated to aggravate the course of disease in individuals while limiting the spread of disease on the population level (24). While we are still uncertain of the epidemiology of hCoV-EMC-related infections, the importance of knowing its receptor in human cells is unquestionable (11). Our data taken together suggest that hCoV-EMC does not rely on the same receptor as SARS-CoV. Urgent further research is needed in order to identify the cellular receptor for hCoV-EMC and determine its anatomical focus of replication. Our observations regarding the cell culture tropism of this novel human virus raise an intriguing perspective. We have shown here that cells from primates, pigs, as well as bats representing four families from both chiropteran suborders, Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera, retain susceptibility for the virus. This breadth of tropism is absolutely unique among CoVs (1, 11, 12). For instance, only once have researchers succeeded in culturing any CoV in bat-derived cells, and these experiments required specifically generated bat cell cultures combined with engineered, reporter gene-expressing virus (12). The broad replicative capability of hCoV-EMC suggests that this new virus might utilize a receptor structure that bats, primates, and pigs have in common. If that receptor were expressed in mucosal surfaces in those hosts, repeated acquisition by humans would be conceivable, putting our current idea of a \u201ctight\u201d molecular barrier against coronaviral cross-host transmission into perspective (11, 12). Interestingly, these data provide strong support for the existence of \u201cgeneralist\u201d CoV, as recently projected based on cell culture studies (12).",

(Left) hACE2 expression was controlled by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) by using goat anti-hACE2 immunoglobulin (Ig) (R&D Systems) followed by cyanin 3-labeled donkey anti-goat Ig (Dianova). For controls, ACE2-expressing primate cell lines (kidney cells from rhesus monkey [LLC-MK2] and African green monkey [MA104]) were stained in parallel. DAPI, 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Bar, 50 \u00b5m. (Right) ACE2 protein surface expression was determined by FACS analysis using a mouse anti-hACE2 Ig antibody (R&D Systems) in combination with an Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig (Life Technologies). Data were acquired using FACS Canto and analyzed with FlowJo software. The cells were incubated with the secondary antibody only (shown in gray) for a control. mAB, monoclonal antibody. (B) The interferon-deficient BHK cells and the generated hACE2-expressing transgenic BHK cells were applied in infection studies. LLC-MK2 and MA104 primate cells known to be susceptible for SARS-CoV were infected in parallel with SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt-1 and hCoV-EMC. The cells were infected with an MOI of 0.5 for 1 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and supplemented with medium. At time points 0 and 40 h after infection, samples from supernatants were taken in order to extract viral RNA. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used for absolute quantification of genome equivalents (GE) per ml of supernatant (2, 10). All experiments were performed in triplicate. hpi, hours postinfection. (C) In order to block the ACE2 receptor, Vero cells were preincubated with 10 \u00b5g/ml of polyclonal goat anti-hACE2 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Half of the antibody solution was stored, and cells were subsequently infected by adding viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and medium with antibody solution was added. At time points 0 and 20 h postinfection, samples from supernatants (triplicate samples) were taken for quantification by real-time RT-PCR. pAb, polyclonal antibody. (D) Virus-neutralizing activity of soluble recombinant hACE2 (rhACE2) was tested by preincubating in triplicate different concentrations of rhACE2 (a kind gift from J. M. Penninger, Vienna, Austria) with 104 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml hCoV-EMC (triangles) or 103 TCID50/ml SARS-CoV (squares) for 1 h. The mixture was added to Vero E6 cells for 1 h, after which cells were washed and fresh medium was added. The infection was stopped after 8 h, and cells were visualized with a cross-reactive SARS-CoV serum followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to peroxidase and stained with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate.",

(Right) Western blot analysis was done using goat anti-hACE2 Ig followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-goat Ig (Dianova). For a control, a protein lysate of MA104 cells was applied to the blot. A loading control was done with a rabbit anti-pan-actin Ig (Cell Signaling). (B) Representative bat cell cultures from Yinpterochiroptera (Rousettus aegyptiacus kidney [RoNi/7] and Rhinolophus landeri lung [RhiLu]) and Yangochiroptera (Pipistrellus pipistrellus kidney [PipNi/1 and PipNi/3], Carollia perspicillata kidney [CarNi/1], and Myotis daubentonii kidney [MyDauNi/2]) and porcine (PS) and human kidney (769-P) cell lines were used for infection studies with SARS-CoV (top panel) and hCoV-EMC (bottom panel). For a control and for comparison, hACE2-expressing transgenic Rousettus bat cell cultures (RoNi/7-hACE2) were included. The cells were infected at an MOI of 0.5 for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and supplemented with medium. At time points 0 and 40 h postinfection, samples from supernatants were taken to extract viral RNA. Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described for absolute quantification of GE. All experiments were performed in triplicate. (C) A hACE2-blocking experiment was done with RoNi/7-hACE2 cells. The cells were preincubated with 10 \u00b5g/ml of polyclonal goat anti-hACE2 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were subsequently infected by adding viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.
