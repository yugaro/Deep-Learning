Because of the high incidence of misdiagnosis, morbidity and mortality, VTE has become one of the essential medical problems around world 1, 2. After 1990's, clinical report of incidence of PE are sharply increased yearly in China 3. After 1990's, clinical reports of PE are sharply increased yearly in China 3. In other Asia regions, such as Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, the number of reported PE cases is also increasing 4-8. There are nearly 900,000 new PE cases in USA every year 9, 78,000 new cases in Canada, 100,000-200,000 cases in Europe including France, Italy, Spain, Britain, Germany, and 47,000 cases in Australia every year 10. According to the statistical data, provided by an epidemiological surveillance in US, PE is the third leading cause of death 11, 12, only lags behind malignancy and myocardial infarction.",

Therefore, we compared gene expressions of these VTE related factors in patients with PE and without PE. Among the expressions of coagulation factor genes, only gene expressions of factor \u2166 and FIBCD1 were significantly elevated in patients with PE compared with patients without PE. As for genes of other coagulant factors, the expression value of patients with PE was either not significantly different or less than those patients without PE in comparison. There was no significant difference between two groups of patients in gene expression of anticoagulant proteins. And so was in gene expression of fibrinolytic factors except plasminogen Urokinase receptor (PLAUR, Fig.1). L-selectin, ITGAL and ICAM-1 are the adhesion molecules originated from different family, mainly distributed on the surface of lymphocytes. ICAM-1 is the ligand of ITGAL which is member of integrin family. Significantly elevated mRNA expression of these adhesion molecules in PE group indicate activated adhesion function of white blood cells. However, mRNA expression of P-selectin (mainly distributed on the surface of ECs and platelets) and E-selection (mainly distributed on the surface of activated ECs) are not elevated in PE group which indicate venous endothelial cells are not impaired in patients with PE (Fig.2). In expression of platelet aggregation related genes, only 2 genes (GP6 and PAFAH1B2) were significantly elevated in the patients with PE. Compared to patients without PE, the expressions of 3 in 7 genes of platelet adhesion function were significantly increased in patients with PE. As for genes of platelet releasing, the expression of one gene was significantly up and down regulated between 2 groups of patients, respectively (Fig.3).",

The main gene ontology categories impacted by these genes involve the up-regulation of 19 functioning categories against 4 down-regulation categories. Up-regulated genes are those genes whose functions are associated with transformation, phosphorylation, cell survival and cell conjugation, et al. While the function of down-regulated genes are relevant to the function of plasma membrane and activity of receptors, especially to the lymphocyte receptor complex and immunological synapse (Fig.4).",

In addition, we also found that the number of CD3+T cells and CD8+T cells was dramatically reduced in a series of acute PE patients and cytological findings also supported the results from genomics studies on PE patients 27. The occurrence of PE is related to the deficient or compromised T cell mediated immunity. This deficiency of T cell immunity may occur under the following conditions: 1) viral infection; 2) malignant tumors; 3) medication with immunosuppresants; 4) malnutrition. In the present study, most of subjects were old patients and malnutrition was not clinically obvious. Moreover, malignant tumors were not found in these patients and medication with immunosuppressants was absent. Thus, the compromised T cell immunity might be possibly related to viral infection.",
