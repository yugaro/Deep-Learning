It is the third significant occurrence of a zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier to infect humans, and it likely will not be the last. Hope is not lost; and a measured approach, one that is cognizant of the seriousness of this public health crisis without giving into hysteria, is imperative.",

Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, possessing the largest viral RNA genome known to-date [1]. They are known for their rapid spread, unpredictable emergence, and their threat to human health, magnified by the wide range of animal reservoirs and the lack of preventive or curative treatments [1, 2, 3, 4].",

Bats were also identified as the primary reservoir for SARS-CoV, although coronaviruses are found in many species [1]. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic CoV responsible for the 2012 MERS outbreak, has been transmitted through contact with camels, although with a different human tropism. The novel coronavirus is believed to infect human cells through its interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, similarly to SARS-CoV [1,4]. Despite the differences between the SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus, the similarities within the beta-CoV genus allow us to extrapolate from our previous experience with corona-virus outbreaks and increase our understanding of the current one.",

Superspreaders (R0>10) have been identified in both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks and there are similar reports of 2019-nCoV superspreaders [4].

Transmission is also to a large degree nosocomial, which is why a measured approach, one that prevents overutilization of medical resources and panic in the general population [4].",

Patients suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV should be managed according to governmental protocols. Patients who do not meet the criteria are unlikely to be infected with 2019-nCoV. Patients with acute respiratory illness, without positive WHO criteria, should not have their management changed solely based on unspecific symptoms.

Patients may present with clinical pictures including uncomplicated respiratory infections, pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis or septic shock [5]. Despite 2019-nCoV being a viral infection, patients meeting sepsis criteria should receive the customary treatment, including early initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, due to the potential of secondary infections [5]. The usage of corticosteroids for viral pneumonia or ARDS is discouraged in patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV unless otherwise indicated [5]. With that being said, our current guidance is interim and good clinical judgment is still necessary when managing patients with 2019-nCoV. While 2019-nCV is novel, coronaviruses are not and the general principles of managing viral pneumonia still apply. Both local reporting guidelines, as well as WHO guidance on the management of 2019-nCoV, will continue to evolve as we better understand the outbreak.",
