            "text": "The adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is divided into seven species by DNA homology and has more than 70 serotypes [1]. Depending on the serotype, HAdV causes various infectious diseases such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and epidemic conjunctivitis. The most common infection due to HAdV is pharyngitis [23]. Mainly developed among children, most of them recover naturally. However some cases progress to severe respiratory infection such as pneumonia and cause death. The known types that cause severe respiratory infection among adults are types 3, 4, and 7, and types 14 and 55 have been reported as the cause of outbreaks [456789]. Adenovirus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, fecal to oral routes, or contaminated environments, and rarely via swimming pool water [1011]. The incubation period of an acute respiratory infection by adenovirus is 2~14 days [2]. Adenovirus infection outbreak in swimming pool, the healthcare facilities, and military camps have been reported [512131415]. An oral vaccine has been introduced in the United States to prevent extensive epidemics of respiratory infections caused by types 4 and 7 in military camps [16]. In Korea, a severe case of adenovirus infection in a military camp, cases of pneumonia and consequent death caused by type 55 have been reported [17181920]. But there has been no report of adenovirus respiratory infection outbreak in schools, education facilities, and private residential facilities in Korea. This study is the first report of the outbreak of acute respiratory infection caused by adenovirus, occurred on school in Korea.",

Each student is a member of one of the16 athletic departments, and every student were accommodated in a campus dormitory. As all students with respiratory symptoms were identified as members of the departments using the swimming pool (swimming and modern sports) at the on-site investigation performed on May 22, a retrospective cohort investigation (Study 1) was conducted instantaneously on 59 students and teachers who had been using the swimming pool. And since 22 May prospective active surveillance (Study 2) has been conducted for all students and school personnel to detect additional cases. For the active surveillance, teachers of each class checked the students every morning for any symptoms of acute respiratory infection and reported the results to the public health center. Questionnaire survey and throat swab investigations were conducted on all 59 of swimming and modern sports departments and additional cases from active surveillance. Thirty three cases who were identified in Study 1 and 14 cases who were identified in Study 2 were enrolled as cases in the present study.",
