Audit has been defined as \u201ca quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit criteria and the implementation of change\u201d [1]. The audit cycle involves five stages: choosing a topic, specifying practice standards, testing actual practice against these standards, corrective action, and finally demonstrating improvement in practice through subsequent data collection and closing the loop [2]. Given the significant financial and personnel investment required to conduct accreditation programmes, research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness and reliability of health-care facility accreditation and/or certification in improving patient safety and quality outcomes [3].",

Providing universal health-care coverage through a National Health Insurance (NHI) system is a major political goal of the current government [5]. Accreditation of health facilities is one of the means proposed to improve quality of care in such a system.

However, there is evidence to suggest that the quality of both IPC and OHS are in need of improvement in the South African public sector. In nationwide external baseline audits conducted in South Africa in 2011\u20132012 by a nongovernmental organization (described further in the following), the proportion of fixed public health-care facilities \u201cfully compliant\u201d with IPC standards was reported to be very low at 0.82% (32 of 3880) [12]. With regard to IPC and OHS, the national mean facility IPC score (averaged over all facilities) was reported as 47% for primary health-care (PHC) facilities and that for the subset domain of OHS as 76% (PHC facilities and hospitals combined). Both were less than the compliance targets set by the National Department of Health [12]. These findings indicate varying performance across different metrics and raise the question of whether such data are a valid reflection of the actual situation in South African health-care services.",

The lack of this qualified resource in a PHC setting may be one explanation for the relatively poor compliance and lack of improvement found in this study. Because only one nursing staff member may be trained in IPC, given the fewer number of staff at PHC facilities, turnover of such staff would disrupt continuity of IPC. Furthermore, good leadership at ward or operational level of staff who share the vision of the organization, who develop and stimulate others, and who are active is associated with effective action on IPC measures [28]. However, achievement of this positive type of leadership is adversely affected by direct supervision of a large number of staff, which may be another reason for a lack of improvement in our setting [28].",

A 2001 study in Mali to determine the impact of internal audits on compliance with quality of care standards reported a significant difference between the intervention group and the control group in overall compliance, suggesting that internal audits can have a significant effect [29]. A 2013 Iranian study to determine the compliance with the Joint Commission International organization\u2013based standards for IPC in 23 hospitals using a self-reported questionnaire with hospital staff found an excellent (>75%) pooled mean hospital IPC score of 79% [30]. Whittaker et al. [15] have shown how facilitated gradual improvements in quality were beneficial in a large South African public sector hospital with a poor baseline and large room for improvement, which took up to three years to reach acceptable levels for accreditation. The relative effects of clinical audit and feedback are thus likely to be larger when baseline compliance with standards is low [ [31]. However, overall there is lack of studies in both high- income countries and low- and middle-income countries reporting on the impact of IPC or OHS auditing or accreditation in PHC as opposed to hospital settings.",

However, some legally required OHS practice items were moved from the PHC National Core Standards facility audit tool to the \u201cdistrict/subdistrict office\u201d tool. The latter managerial level tool was used once (but not covered in this study) and subsequently dropped (AM Van den berg\u2014personal communication). This reflects reversion to a focus on operational or \u201cproximate\u201d measures and neglect of systemic or \u201cupstream\u201d factors which may, however, play an important role in determining compliance with protective standards. Finally, a major limitation of the National Core Standards audit tools is that they focus heavily on structure and process measures. As there were no outcome measures, it remains to be seen whether compliance leads to actual improvement in patient or staff outcomes.",

However, internal audits were not available at baseline. In addition, external audits at follow-up were performed only at about half the eligible facilities, as selected by the Office of Health Standards Compliance. Accordingly, to maximize the sample for measuring change over time, we used external audit at baseline and internal at follow-up. This in fact accords with the intention of the Office of Health Standards approach which is that facilities will effect quality improvement and their own (internal) audit after an external audit. The follow-up external audit results were thus used only for the reliability study, although the smaller sample resulted in wide CIs around the agreement metrics.",

Poor inter-rater reliability indicates a large amount of measurement error making it difficult to interpret changes over time as reflecting real improvement or deterioration in quality. Taking into consideration the limited improvements found and the possible upward bias in internal auditing, it is unlikely that there was significant improvement in compliance over the three years of observation. It is possible that feedback alone cannot be relied upon to improve IPC and OHS standards in PHC facilities and that the penalties mentioned earlier may need to be invoked.

In low- and middle-income countries, where human resources for health are already scarce and at high burden of infectious diseases such as TB and HIV, it is crucial that health services improve their IPC and OHS practices. However, the use of repeat auditing to achieve such improvements in compliance and/or outcomes must itself be evidence based.",
