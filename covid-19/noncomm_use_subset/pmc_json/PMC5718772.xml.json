The results are summarized in Table 2. We found that the volume of leaked liquid was dependent on the structural characteristics of each material; samples 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 had low leakage volumes. Detection sensitivity was improved by using absorption paper rather than by relying on simple visual inspection. In this study, an SB volume as low as 0.05 \u03bcl that penetrated sample 5 was detected using absorption paper (Fig. 3). Our previous study demonstrated a positive correlation between leaked SB volume and number of penetrated microbes15). Therefore, quantifying the volume of leaked liquid is a more effective approach for evaluating the protection performance of materials used to manufacture PPC and masks against pathogens than the current method based on visual observation. For instance, HBV DNA concentration in the whole blood of infected patients was found to be 7.5\u00d7105\u22124.3\u00d7108 copies/ml;19) HBV-infected patient blood contains 37.5\u22122.15\u00d7104 copies HBV DNA/0.05 \u03bcl. Thus, HCWs are at high risk of HBV infection, given that a previous study reported that the minimum amount required for transmission of HBV is approximately 30 copies in the case of chimpanzees20).",

This implies that protection performance is dependent on multiple factors\u2014i.e., mainly material structure, but also load condition (splash impact and continuous pressure). Therefore, it is necessary to test materials under various conditions to determine their protective capacity. It is important for HCWs to select suitable PPC and masks certified by testing. Identifying differences in protection performance by various test methods can facilitate PPE selection based on risk assessment so that accidental exposure to infectious agents can be avoided. However, there are few methods currently available for testing the performance of protective materials against hazardous biological agents (Table 3). These tests typically measure the penetration of a liquid/particle or the permeation of molecules through PPE materials or membranes21). For handling hazardous biological agents such as microorganisms, PPE that protects against microparticles with a size of ~20 nm is required. Therefore, materials with high protective performance against penetration or permeation of liquid or small particles are equally suitable for protection against hazardous biological agents.",
