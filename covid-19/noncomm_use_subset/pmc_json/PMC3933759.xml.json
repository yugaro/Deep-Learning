Given that no patient presented with severe symptoms, all the patients were treated at the village health center and continued to attend school without isolation. Many children presented with the same symptoms of a mild form of FRI. Public health officials at the local CDC office were engaged, and they undertook measures to prevent disease spread, such as morning temperature screening of children, ensuring ventilation through open doors and windows, and disinfecting school surfaces with 0\u00b72% peroxyacetic acid spray.

Therefore, the possibility that the origin of HAdV\u201014p1 in China derived from that outbreak cannot be ruled out. In 2012, Tang submitted to GenBank (JN032132\u00b71) the genome sequence of HAdV\u201014p1 isolated in Beijing in 2010 from a 6\u2010month\u2010old child with an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI).
