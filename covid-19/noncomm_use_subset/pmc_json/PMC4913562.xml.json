The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of standardized BAL on thoracic radiographs in a referral\u2010hospital population compared to healthy controls, in which caudoventral and caudodorsal radiographs of the thorax were taken before and after BAL. Based on the results of the clinical examination, blood gas analysis, bronchoscopy, BAL cytology and thoracic radiography 53 horses were available for study including 12 healthy controls and 41 horses affected by chronic respiratory disease: recurrent airway obstruction (RAO, n = 12), inflammatory airway disease (IAD, n = 21) and chronic interstitial pneumopathy (CIP, n = 6). Caudoventral and caudodorsal radiographs were obtained from all horses before and within 30 min after BAL, blinded, randomized and interpreted by three independent observers. The ability of observers to correctly identify the time point of the radiograph (before or after BAL) was significantly influenced by clinical diagnosis and projection. Based on a logistic mixed model, the chance (adjusted odds) of misinterpretation of the correct time point was about 3 times higher in radiographs of RAO horses when compared to healthy controls (OR = 3.13, P = 0.019). No significant differences were found for IAD and CIP. The chance of misinterpretation of the correct time point was about 3 times lower in caudo\u2010dorsal projections than in caudo\u2010ventral projections (OR = 0.232, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of the study lead to the recommendation to perform BAL after thoracic radiography, although radiographic quality might only be affected in minor disease.",

In total 446 animals were recruited to the study; the median (interquartile range) age was 15 (10, 20) years; 50.4% were mares and 49.6% geldings; the most common breeds were welsh (36%), Shetland (17%) and cob (9%); 72.2% were overweight/obese (BCS 7\u20139/9), 27.3% ideal weight (BCS 4\u20136/9) and 0.5% underweight (BCS 1\u20133/9). After 1 and 2 years, 18 (4%) and 30/446 (7%) had developed laminitis. Plasma [adiponectin] and basal and post dexamethasone serum [insulin] were significantly (P \u2264 0.05) associated with development of laminitis after 1 and 2 years. Plasma [IGF\u20101] was significantly (P \u2264 0.05) associated with development of laminitis after 2 years. In conclusion, laminitis risk factors prior to disease occurrence include low plasma [adiponectin] and [IGF\u20101] and high basal or post dexamethasone serum [insulin]. However, it was not possible to generate cut\u2010off values to accurately predict future laminitis development in an individual animal.",

All were kept in a paddock with minimal pasture coverage but extensive growth of Malva parviflora, which they were grazing. Feed supplementation was minimal. Horse 1 was euthanized on the farm due to rapid clinical deterioration. Horse 2 was referred for hospital care where it was determined to have severe myocardial disease and generalised myopathy; this horse was euthanized due to prolonged recumbency and severe cardiac arrhythmias 36 h after admission. Horse 3 died during transport to hospital, and horse 4 was euthanized at onset of clinical signs. Post mortem examinations performed on horses 2, 3 and 4 revealed acute, multifocal, monophasic myonecrosis of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Myocyte glycogen accumulation was absent (PAS stain; horse 2). Acyl carnitine profiles were performed on serum from horses 2 and 4 and equine controls. These revealed increased C14\u2010C18 acyl carnitines in cases relative to controls. Malvalic, sterculic, and dihydrosterculic acids (present in Malva parviflora) were grossly increased in sera of cases relative to controls. The prominent cardiac component and different acyl carnitine profile suggests a different aetiology to atypical/seasonal pasture myopathy. We hypothesise that these cyclopropene fatty acids found in Malva parviflora interfere with fatty acid beta\u2010oxidation in horses in negative energy balance, causing the clinical signs and abnormal acyl carnitine profiles. These equine cases closely resemble the human genetic condition Very Long Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency.",

Acute and convalescent serum samples from 83 adult horses involved in 6 different outbreaks were used. An ELISA starter accessory kit, the purified ECoV S\u2010protein and anti\u2010horse IgG were used for this purpose. Optical density (OD) values from the field samples, as well as from our positive and negative control samples, were obtained using the ELISA. The ELISA was able to reliably and repeatedly classify negative and positive control serum samples. The average corrected threshold OD was determined to be 0.955 with a standard deviation of 0.227. The assay was found to be linear over an OD range of 0.557\u20133.487. Intra\u2010assay coefficient of variation ranged from 0.8 to 6.4%, with an average of 3.1%. The inter\u2010assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.9 to 4.2%, with an average of 3.0%. The greatest seroconversion rate was observed in horses with clinical signs compatible with ECoV and ECoV qPCR detection in feces. Results showed that the ECoV ELISA is able to reliably detect antibodies to ECoV and could therefore be a valuable tool to diagnose and monitor ECoV outbreaks in the future.",

The onset of clinical signs was related to a period of restricted intake of green forage. Apart from poor body condition, horses did not show any symptoms related to gastrointestinal disease. A preliminary diagnosis of EMND was made based on clinical signs and low serum levels of vitamin E (0.11 \u00b1 0.04 mg/dL, normal range: 0.3\u20131.5 mg/dL). Four horses, which were severely affected and deemed irrecoverable, were euthanized and subjected to detailed postmortem exam, which confirmed EMND and also allowed to rule out equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy. EMND was diagnosed based on changes in muscle histopathology (neurogenic atrophy) and spinal cord lesions (neuronal chromatolysis in ventral horns).

Surgical records of horses that underwent colic surgery between January 2011 and February 2103 with complete anaesthetic records, were evaluated retrospectively. The Equine Surgical Shock Index (ESSI) was calculated as HR/MAP. ESSI measured at the first MAP measurement (FESSI) and the maximal ratio calculated during surgery (MESSI), were compared between horses that died and those that survived until hospital discharge. ROC analysis was used to establish area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of both ESSI to predict outcome. Of 139 horses studied 78.3% survived to discharge. FESSI and MESSI were significantly higher in non\u2010survivors compared to horses that lived until discharge (P = 0.01; P = 0.008, respectively).

Our aim was to compare three scales; the six\u2010point Equine Acute Abdominal Pain Scale (EAAPS), a four\u2010point scale by Mair & Smith (M&S), and a six\u2010point numerical rating scale (NRS). Forty short films of horses, including 35 colic cases and 5 control horses, were randomly presented to 46 international equine clinicians by website. Randomly allocated into three groups, participants used one of three scales. Five films, randomly selected, were shown twice for intraobserver reliability. Speed, ease of use and face validity of the scales were evaluated. Response rate was excellent; 89% of the EAAPS (16/18), 100% of the M&S (18/18) and NRS groups (10/10). The intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.87 for EAAPS indicates significantly better interobserver reliability compared to 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58\u20130.79] for M&S and 0.71 for NRS. A kappa of 0.95 for the intraobserver reliability of EAAPS compared to 0.77 (95%CI: 0.68\u20130.86) for the other scales. Convergent, extreme group and predictive validities were comparable for all three scales. Regarding the usability of the scales, there was no significant difference between the three scales with respect to the time taken to score the films (speed) or the ease of use of the scales. The face validity, however, was significantly better for the M&S scale compared to the EAAPS scale. The EAAPS showed superior reliability, the M&S scale, better face validity with comparable usability and other tests of validity.",

The aim of this study was to compare insulinaemic and glycaemic responses to three commonly fed forages. Twelve ponies (11 mares and 1 gelding) of mixed breeds, mean age 9 years old (range 4\u201315) and median body condition score 7.0/9 (range 4.2\u20137.8) were recruited and maintained under identical management conditions. Following acclimation, a randomised crossover study was conducted. Each week ponies were fed 0.25% body weight as dry matter (DM) either as hay, soaked hay or haylage, or a combined glucose\u2010insulin tolerance test (CGIT) was conducted. The glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to feeding were monitored over 5 h. Area under the curve (AUC) for insulin (AUCi) was greater for haylage compared to hay (P = 0.019) and soaked hay (P = 0.002), and greater for hay compared to soaked hay (P = 0.002). AUC for glucose (AUCg) was lower for soaked hay compared to hay (P = 0.002) and haylage (P = 0.003). Four ponies were classified as EMS positive based on their CGIT result. Compared to EMS negative ponies, EMS positive ponies had greater AUCi after hay (P = 0.027), soaked hay (P = 0.017) and haylage (P = 0.042). In contrast, there was no detectable effect of EMS status on AUCg. On an equivalent DM basis, soaked hay produced the lowest and haylage the highest insulinaemic and glycaemic responses to feeding. The insulinaemic effects of all forages were greater in ponies with EMS. These data can be used to guide feeding of equids with EMS.",

In this study effects of a diet\u2010induced increase in body weight on body fat accumulation and localization was determined in 13 Shetland pony mares (3\u20137 years old), randomly divided into a control and a test group. They were fed either a maintenance diet (100% NE) or high fat diet (200% NE) for 24 weeks. BCS were not significantly different at the start of the diet (4.9 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 5.1 \u00b1 1.2) between both groups. Twelve weeks after starting the diet, measurements of the BCS, body weight and ultrasonography of adipose tissue on five different locations (retroperitoneal, axillary, withers, ribeye and rump) started on a monthly basis. Linear mixed\u2010effects model with Bonferroni as post hoc test was used for statistics. P values <0.05 were considered significant. Fat thickness in the test group was already significantly higher compared to the control group at week 12. During the measuring period, the test group showed a further significant increase in mean body weight (+20%, P < 0.05) and BCS (8.3 \u00b1 0.3, +61%) while the control group remained the same. The test group kept increasing retroperitoneal fat accumulation significantly over time, while adipose tissue stored in axilla, withers, ribeye and rump region ceased to increase after three months of measurements. In conclusion diet induced fat accumulation initially occurred both subcutaneously and retroperitoneally, while after 20 weeks further fat accumulation occurred mainly intra\u2010abdominally.",

Four ponies (test group) received a diet rich in fat and carbohydrates containing 200% of their maintenance energy requirements and four ponies (control group) received a diet containing 100% of their maintenance energy requirements. The high energy diet resulted in weight gain of at least 20% and significant hyperinsulinemia. After the end of the 24 week period (t = 0) both groups received only ad libitum hay for 15 weeks. Before (t = 0) and after (t = 1) the hay\u2010only period an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and non\u2010invasive blood pressures (oscillometric device on coccygeal artery; Cardell 9402) were determined. A general linear mixed model with Bonferroni correction as well as a t\u2010test was used for statistical analysis and significance was set at P < 0.05. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the test group (Psyst 134 \u00b1 4 mmHg; Pdiast 69 \u00b1 3 mmHg) when compared to the control group at t = 0 (Psyst 121 \u00b1 6 mmHg; Pdiast 61 \u00b1 1 mmHg) (P = 0.000) and t = 1 (P = 0.000). Diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher at t = 1 compared to t = 0 in the control group (P = 0.011). The hyperinsulinemic response to the OGTT did not change between t = 0 and t = 1 in the test group, while the blood glucose area under the curve increased. It can be concluded that a short term decrease of fat and carbohydrate intake does not change the blood pressure in obese hyperinsulinemic Shetland ponies.

Included in the study were 16 horses with an age of one to 15 years without clinical signs of PPID and moderate pain due to different reasons. There were 13 horses with orthopedic problems including five horses with laminitis and three horses with colic. All horses were judged according to a modified painscore developed by BUSSI\u00c8RES et al. (2008), GRAUBNER et al. (2011) and DALLA COSTA et al. (2014) and divided into three different groups according to their pain level. Baseline ACTH and cortisol levels were measured and a TRH\u2010stimulation test performed as previously described. Those horses that reached a painfree or mildly painful level were used as their own controls. All horses except one had baseline ACTH and cortisol levels within the reference ranges. There were no significant differences between the paingroups and the control group or in between the three different pain groups regarding baseline ACTH/cortisol levels or ACTH/cortisol levels after stimulation (Kruskal\u2010Wallis\u2010Test and Wilcoxon\u2010Rank\u2010Test).

Data were collected from one Thoroughbred stud farm in New Zealand over six consecutive breeding seasons (969 foaling records). At the time of foaling the gestation length, presentation, position and posture of the foal, time taken for the foal to stand and nurse and fetal membrane retention time was recorded. Gestation length for mares in this study was 349 \u00b1 10 days. Gestation length for filly foals (348.3 days) was significantly shorter than for colt foals (350.7 days) and gestation length increased with increasing age of the mare. Most mares (53.5%) foaled between 7.00 pm and 1.00am and the occurrence of daytime foaling was 22.2%. Of the 969 foalings, 97.4% produced a live foal. The dystocia rate was 7.3%. Risk factors for perinatal foal death included being a colt and the occurrence of dystocia. Fillies were significantly (P < 0.001) quicker to stand and nurse than colts. Ninety five percent of mares had expelled their fetal membranes within four hours of parturition. Whilst some of these findings are similar to the results of studies performed in Northern Hemisphere populations, gestation length appears to be longer in this population of mares and there is a relatively high number of daytime foalings. Based on these findings, it is proposed that retained fetal membranes should be defined as retention beyond 4 hours post\u2010partum.",

The survey included 41 questions related to the type, dose, method, frequency and timing of electrolyte supplementation level of competition and performance data including causes of elimination. Descriptive analysis was performed and potential associations explored using Mann Whitney tests (at P < 0.05). Endurance horses were mainly purebred Arabian horses (67.9%) aged between 5\u201314 years. 100% of responders (88) supplemented with electrolytes at different times: during training (67.9%), pre\u2010competition (60.7%), during competition (85.7%) and post\u2010competition (78.6%). Supplements were mainly used to replace electrolytes losses (37.5%) and were primarily supplied in food (78.9%) or in paste form (45.8%) while only 5.7% used salt blocks. Median dose rates were higher during competition (47.5 g) compared with training (30 g). Elimination rate was 14.3%, mainly due to lameness (75%), myopathy (7.1%) and high heart rate (3%). This pilot study suggests wide variation in electrolyte supplementation during endurance riding in Australia. However, larger numbers are required to investigate their use in more detail.",

Thirty liver biopsies were collected from horses suspected to be suffering from liver disease between January 2008 and May 2013 and owners were contacted by telephone to determine survival. A score was assigned to each biopsy using the system developed by Durham et al which was modified by including cholestasis and reversible cytopathology as these parameters were associated with a poorer prognosis in our study. Horses were categorized according to their biopsy scores and differences in survival between groups were assessed (using a chi\u2010squared test), as were differences in enzyme concentrations (AP, AST, GGT and LDH) between survivors and non\u2010survivors and between groups (using a two\u2010sample t\u2010test). A P\u2010value <0.05 was considered to be significant. In the present study 17/30 (56%) cases survived for at least 6 months. There was no significant difference in survival or blood enzyme concentrations between different biopsy score categories or in blood enzyme concentrations between survivors and non\u2010survivors. Using the modified liver biopsy grading system horses had a poorer prognosis if they had a biopsy score >1. Both scoring systems were easy to apply and scoring a larger number of biopsies would help determine the usefulness of these grading systems in the horse population under investigation in the present study and the added value of including cholestasis and reversible cytopathology.",

Horses get infected with NPHV naturally, but neither the clinical relevance of the disease nor the route of transmission are known. Therefore, this study aims to assess the clinical course and equine immune responses after experimental NPHV infection. Three horses were injected intravenously with NPHV positive plasma with a viral load of 7.8 \u00d7 106 RNA copies/ml. Animals were monitored for clinical signs of hepatitis; blood samples were drawn for haematological, blood biochemical and virological evaluation on a weekly basis and liver biopsies were taken to evaluate parenchymal changes. Within 14 days of infection, virus RNA was detected in all horses. During infection horses remained bright and alert without showing clinical signs of disease. Nevertheless, clinicopathological data and indicated liver pathology in one of the horses. To assess acute phase responses, serum amyloid A was measured, but did not change significantly. Similarly, the course of immunoglobulin subsets was variable between individual horses. All horses showed a delayed seroconversion and cleared the virus. Histopathology did not show clear inflammatory reactions after infection. In conclusion, experimental infection of horses with NPHV is possible. Virus clearance was achieved in all horses and although no clinical signs of disease were seen, our data supports that at least a mild hepatitis might develop after infection.",

Injections into the tumor bed of feline fibrosarcomas with poxviruses expressing feline interleukin 2 (IL 2) reduced the recurrence rate after surgical resection, due to a stimulation of antitumor immunity. The published sequences of feline and equine IL 2 show a high homology. In this study we investigated the safety and efficacy of the application of poxviruses expressing feline interleukin 2 in healthy horses and horses with equine sarcoids. Four healthy horses injected subcutaneously with the recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2. One horse developed temporary mild swelling at the side of injection. There were no significant differences in the clinical examination and hematologic profile (CBC and fibrinogen) before and after injection. Up to now, four horses with a total number of nine equine sarcoids (occult and nodular) were treated twice with a seven day interval with recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2. One sarcoid vanished completely, five showed reduction in size and three remained unchanged. There were no significant changes in the hematologic profile (CBC and fibrinogen) before and after treatment. One of the horses developed mild fever the day after injection, which subsided the following day. Treatment of equine sarcoids with recombinant poxviruses expressing feline IL 2 seems to be a safe and promising therapy option. The study is ongoing to substantiate the preliminary results.",

Laboratory findings included leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia and severe hypoxemia. Thoracic ultrasound examination showed disruption of the pleural surface and thoracic radiographs revealed signs of a mild interstitial pattern. The patient died peracutely before further diagnostic tests could be performed. Gross pathology showed multifocal, firm, well\u2010demarcated, pale nodules throughout the lung.

Histologically a severe, chronic\u2010active, fibrous interstitial pneumonia with numerous syncytial cells, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and acute alveolar wall necrosis was evident. The clinical signs, necropsy findings and lack of other pathogens corresponded well with EMPF and therefore samples of frozen lung tissue were transmitted for further virus examination.

A cross\u2010sectional study was performed with 127 Andalusian horses (49 barren mares and 78 stallions) with a mean age of 6.37 \u00b1 3.70. Horses were categorized based on BCS as obese if BCS \u22657. Morphometric measurements (in cm) including girth, waist, body length, and height at the withers were taken to calculate body ratios (girth:height, girth:length, waist:height and waist:length). Concentrated feed was withheld for at least 12 h before sampling. Blood extractions were performed between 06:00 and 12:00am to measure fasting insulin, leptin and triglycerides concentrations. Correlations between variables and mean comparisons were carried out. Thirty\u2010three horses (26%) were obese. BCS, all morphometric ratios, leptin and triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in obese horses. In the entire sample, BCS was significantly correlated with leptin, triglycerides, and all morphometric ratios, being girth:length the best correlated ratio Leptin was correlated with insulin and all body ratios. Triglycerides were correlated with waist:height and waist:length ratios. Insulin was correlated with girth: height and girth:length. These results show that in contrast with studies carried out in other breeds, BCS in Andalusian Horses, is not associated with insulin levels, and girth:length ratio is the best correlated parameter with it.",

OGT and CGIT were performed in twelve healthy warmblood horses. Horses were of different sex, aged 15 \u00b1 6.5 years and weighing 567 \u00b1 81 kg. The body condition score (BCS) was 4.8 \u00b1 1.6. OGT was performed with 1 g/kg bwt glucose administered via naso\u2010gastric intubation.

Anecdotal evidence suggests possible geographical variation in the prevalence of AAD and antimicrobials implicated in AAD. The aim of the current study was to compare the prevalence of AAD in three referral hospitals (two in south\u2010eastern UK; one in the eastern USA). Medical records from the 3 hospitals were reviewed. Horses admitted with diarrhoea, or which were transferred to the Isolation unit due to diarrhoea during hospitalisation were included. AAD was defined as the development of diarrhoea in horses treated with antimicrobials for a non\u2010gastrointestinal complaint in the 2 weeks prior to admission. Horses from Hospital 1 were admitted between 1999 and 2012; Hospital 2 between 2010 and 2012 and Hospital 3 between 2006 and 2007. Clinicopathologic data, antimicrobials implicated and outcome was recorded, and prevalence of AAD was compared between institutions, and between countries. AAD was diagnosed in 21/126 horses with diarrhoea (16.7%). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of AAD between centres: Hospital 1 9.4% (n = 6/64), Hospital 2 16.7% (n = 6/36) and Hospital 3 34.6% (n = 9/26). (P = 0.01) There was a significant difference in the prevalence of AAD between countries: UK 12% (12/100); USA 34.6% (9/26). (P = 0.01) A wide range of antimicrobials and antimicrobial combinations were implicated. No significant difference in clinicopathologic data and outcome was identified between AAD and non\u2010AAD horses, apart from rectal temperature, which was higher in horses with AAD (38.6\u00b0C versus 38\u00b0C; P = 0.04). These results suggest that a geographical difference in the prevalence of AAD may exist. Further investigation into risk factors, in particular the type of antimicrobials commonly implicated, should be pursued in different geographical locations to further explore this result.",

Faecal samples were collected non\u2010invasively before and six weeks after supplementation with ERME (24) or a control feed (21) twice daily.

Principal components analysis was also employed to observe any trends and groupings within the respective data sets.

The volatile faecal metabolome was dominated by organic acids, alcohols and ketones; this study demonstrates that twice\u2010daily dietary supplementation with ERME may significantly alter the profile of VOCs in pastured horses and ponies which could be important in optimising therapeutic strategies and preventative interventions for diseases associated with grazing on pasture.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate vascular dynamics, by Doppler ultrasonography, submitting peripheral vasculature to vasodilatation through exercise and, to distal vasoconstriction through criotheraphy in healthy horses. Cross sectional study including 12 healthy adults horses of different breeds was designed. Two groups were made, group 1 included 7 horses that were submitted to exercise for 30 minutes, and group 2 included 5 horses that were submitted to criotherapy applying an ice bag to the distal aspect of the limb for 60 minutes, measurements were made every 15 minutes during 1 hour for both procedures. Qualitative spectrum characteristics and quantitative Doppler measurements of the left and right lateral palmar digital arteries were obtained in each group. Interestingly, an increase in arterial diameter was recorded and low resistance pattern turn to more laminar pattern in both groups. However while decreased peripheral resistance was observed after exercise, peripheral resistance and the pulsatility index were increased after cryotherapy. Moreover, 3 horses showed reverse diastolic blood flow after cryotherapy. These results shows that peripheral vascular dynamic changes are evident in healthy horses with induced vasodilatation and distal vasoconstriction and can be identify by Doppler ultrasonography. In laminitis, the just in time identification of the ongoing process can help to focus the treatment established and adapt it, depending on vascular dynamics observed.",

The introduction of carriers into areas where competent tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease.

Endurance racing is a demanding discipline consisting on achieving long distances in a timely fashion and horses with the subclinical disease or carriers could potentially have performance limitations. The objective of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of equine Piroplasmosis in endurance horses and the effect on its performance. Forty horses from different competitions were included. Several clinical and laboratory parameters for each horse were analyzed. The presence of antibodies was confirmed with indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) for Babesia and Theilleria. The seroprevalence of equine piroplasmosis, tested by indirect inmmunofluorescence antibody was 70%. Thin blood smears were negative for hemoparasites. The parameters with greater variations between the two periods, pre and post exercise, were the concentrations of CK, AST and LDH. The mean PCV before the competition was lower for the group with piroplasmosis. There were not significant differences between Piroplasmosis positive and negative horses in the performance.
