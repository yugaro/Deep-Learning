MERS entered the country through a single infected traveler and was amplified by infections in hospitals and the movement of cases within and between hospitals (1). Ninety-seven percent (181/186) of all the cases were associated with healthcare facilities (2). Given that emergency departments (EDs) were suggested as the primary locations through which the virus was spread, changes in their utilization pattern (i.e., a decrease in ED visits) were observed.",

In that study, the number of pediatric ED patients suddenly increased by 19.7% during the H1N1 outbreak in comparison to an increase of 1% in adult patients (9). This sudden increase in the use of EDs was caused by a fear of the flu in which the media played a major role. Rubinson et al. (21) also showed that there was a 31% increase in the number of ED patients during the H1N1 epidemic. In 1987, during a forest fire disaster in California, the number of ED visits due to asthma and respiratory infections increased 1.4 times (23). In Korea, two studies analyzed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the H1N1 pandemic (2425). Nam et al. (25) compared the H1N1 pandemic period from October 2009 to March 2010 to the same months during the first three years. The number of patients who were admitted to the ED with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection was 15,217 during the pandemic period, although only 1,304 patients visited the ED one year later, showing that the utilization of EDs increased dramatically during the pandemic period. In contrast, our study showed that both the proportion of patients with mild symptoms and the number of ED visit decreased at the time of the MERS outbreak, which was a respiratory infection that was similar to H1N1. Unlike H1N1, the MERS infection in Korea was characterized by its spreading through hospital facilities. In particular, the ED was considered as a high-risk place of exposure, suggesting that the number of ED visits might have decreased at the time of the MERS outbreak.",

One study showed that during the H1N1 outbreak, ED visits for influenza-like illness peaked quickly in the first week of the outbreak and remained high for approximately 6 weeks (6). The reason why ED visits recovered so quickly was that the Korean government declared that the MERS outbreak had ended on July 28th and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that MERS was no longer likely to spread in Korea (2627). When there were no newly reported infected patients, the anxiety about the MERS infection significantly decreased and patients visited the ED regularly as before. Also, our hospital had no infected MERS patients, so when the end of MERS was declared, ED visits resumed normal. It is possible that other EDs may not recovered as quickly. The results are limited to the interpretation as a result of a single hospital study. Therefore, it is necessary to study the number of patient visits to the ED after MERS in various local hospitals.",

Future research is suggested, and a re-evaluation of all the data from emergency rooms at tertiary educational institutions in Korea during the same period is necessary. The analysis of data from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) is needed. Second, there might be unmeasured confounding factors that could have affected the outcomes such as an underlying disease. Third, the ESI level that we used might not completely reflect the true disease severity, as it is sorted based on the initial assessment of the acuity level, followed by the expected resource needs.",
