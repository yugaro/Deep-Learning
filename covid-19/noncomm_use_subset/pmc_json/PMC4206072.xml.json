The lungs are the most frequently involved organ for such infection [2]. According to a recent guideline established by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), chest radiograph is recommended for patients with respiratory signs and symptoms in order to rule out the presence of pneumonia [3]. The problem is that a chest radiograph frequently cannot depict the presence of lung abnormality at the early stage of pneumonia. Heussel et al. [4] demonstrated the presence of inflammatory pulmonary disease on computed tomography (CT) in more than 50% of febrile neutropenic patients who had normal chest radiographs. Hence, in daily practice, chest CT studies are recommended in patients with a risk for complicated pulmonary infection [5]; consequently, the rates of chest CT use have increased in febrile neutropenic patients [6].",

In addition, thyroid glands, breast, and lungs are among the most cancer-susceptible organs in the body, and those organs are all included in chest CT. Therefore, although diagnostic information on lung abnormalities is needed in febrile neutropenic patients, CT radiation dose should be reduced as much as reasonably achievable [9].",

Clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever was based on fulfillment of body temperature higher than 38 Celsius with absolute neutrophil count lower than 500.

The infectious pneumonia group was subdivided into four categories according to pathogens identified:bacterial,viral,fungal, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms. For example, in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia, we checked CMV antigemia and treatment response. Second, diagnosis of noninfectious pneumonia was made on lung parenchymal lesions, which were deemed to be less responsible for infectious focus. In addition, the patients in this category did not show any response to antibiotic or antifungal treatment. Patients who had no abnormal lesions on ULDCT, no evidence of extrathoracic fever focus, no response to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral treatments, and no new lesion on follow-up chest radiographs taken during two weeks after fever onset were categorized as having normal chest finding. Extrathoracic fever focus was elucidated by making a diagnosis of extrathoracic fever focus by disclosing definite evidence, such as catheter related infection, pseudomembranous colitis, or urinary tract infection.",

Therefore, prognosis of febrile neutropenic patients is determined by early identification of the underlying microorganisms and the timely start of specific antimicrobial drug therapy.

However, even with surgical lung biopsy the definite diagnosis could not be made in a certain percentage of patients in whom identifiable abnormalities were observed on CT or chest radiography. Also in our study, diagnoses for lung abnormalities were made by integrating clinical, laboratory, imaging, microbiologic, or histopathologic findings. Second, because this study was conducted prospectively before the clinical use of state-of-the-art dose reduction techniques such as adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) or model-based iterative reconstruction [25], such new techniques could not be applied in our study. If these techniques could have been applied, the lowest thus more mitigated radiation-dose CT images might have been produced and used for image interpretation. However, there has still been debate regarding the image quality of ASIR-applied image, particularly for interstitial lung lesions or ground-glass opacities due to spatial resolution and edge sharpness [23]. In addition, we did not obtain the standard dose CT simultaneously for direct comparison with image quality because our concern was the precise impact on clinical decision. The other reason was the ethical concern of increased radiation exposure by double scanning. We also worried about a higher radiation exposure dose of ULDCT compared with chest X-ray. We did the best we could to reduce the radiation dose even approximately one twelfth of the effective dose of conventional chest CT (7.0 mSv). And, we thought that reduction of mortality due to early detection of fever focus is more important than radiation hazard.",
