This new coronavirus variant was termed SARS-CoV. The intermediate host of SARS-CoV was the masked palm civet cat.2 From China this new zoonotic viral pneumonia rapidly spread worldwide to 30 countries. In one year, 8273 SARS cases occurred with 774 deaths. In addition, the financial impact from limiting travel, tourism, disruption of trade and commerce, shifting of hospital services, quarantine of exposed patients and health care workers, and lost wages suffered from victims of SARS, isolation of patients suspected of carrying the contagious virus was enormous. Mutation of SARS-CoV surface spike proteins found in the coronavirus that usually circulates in the animal reservoir permitted binding to human ACE 2 receptors with a sudden switch in susceptible vertebrate hosts facilitating transmission to humans.1,2 As mysteriously as SARS appeared in 2002, it disappeared in the summer of 2003.",

In June 2012, the index case of MERS-CoV occurred in Saudi Arabia.3,4 Since that time, according to the World Health Organization, there have been 688 confirmed cases and 282 deaths in 20 countries. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian peninsula, i.e., Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait and Lebanon. In addition, travel-related MERS cases have been reported from Europe (United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, France, and Germany) as well as Tunisia, Malaysia, Philippines, Egypt, and most recently Iran and the United States. The zoonotic vector and possible reservoir of MERS has been found to be dromedary camels, with bats as another possible vector for transmission to humans.5 Although both SARS and MERS are caused by coronaviruses, SARS was characterized by efficient human transmission and relatively low mortality rate while MERS is relatively inefficiently transmitted to humans but has a high mortality rate, i.e., 35\u201350%.6 In terms of virulence, MERS most closely resembles pandemic influenza (H1N1) and avian influenza (H7N9) not SARS, but MERS potential for widespread transmissibility is less than avian influenza (H7N9).",

Coronaviruses have relatively large genome (26\u201332 kb) and all six human coronavirus subgroups have been cultured in vitro except for the \u03b2 coronavirus subtype HKU1.1,2 MERS-CoV is the first C lineage \u03b2 coronavirus known to infect humans. Although MERS-CoV is genetically closely related to other \u03b2 coronaviruses isolated from bats in Europe, Mexico, Africa, and Hong Kong, dromedary camels are the likely reservoir for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula.5 In tissue culture, MERS-CoV shows cytopathic effects (CPEs) in LLC-MK2 or Vero cell lines. Distinctive from the SARS-CoV receptor, the MERS-CoV cell receptor has been identified as DDP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) which interacts with the MERS-CoV surface protein. MERS-CoV is present in ciliated bronchial epithelium, in terminal bronchial epithelium, and alveolar macrophages.5",

As with influenza, some patients report a sore throat. The chest radiograph is abnormal in patients ill enough to be hospitalized. A unilateral basilar infiltrate is common initially resembling a lobar/segmental bacterial pneumonia. More commonly, MERS presents with bilateral interstitial infiltrates which may be somewhat ovoid or nodular in appearance.5 Small pleural effusions are not uncommon. Consolidation may occur but cavitation is not a feature of MERS pneumonia.17 Bacterial co-infection does not occur with MERS.15 Patients rapidly progress to ARDS (small lung volumes without cardiomegaly) with severe hypoxemia and bilateral interstitial infiltrates as with severe pandemic influenza (H1N1) or severe avian influenza (H7N9).

Thrombocytopenia occurs less frequently than in influenza pneumonia where it is a near universal finding in hospitalized adults. Serum transaminases are often mildly to moderately elevated in hospitalized patients with MERS. MERS-CoV is present in blood, urine, and feces, but the diagnosis is made by demonstrating the SARS-CoV in lower respiratory secretions by RT PCR. In hospitalized patients with severe viral pneumonia, the likelihood of recovery of MERS is highest in lower respiratory tract specimen secretions rather than nasal swabs.5,17,18 Without a travel history linking the patient to the Arabian peninsula or a known MERS case, the clinical presentation may be indistinguishable from other severe viral pneumonias.17 The clinical feature which distinguishes MERS from influenza is the relatively high frequency of renal involvement, i.e., renal failure with MERS5,14-16 (Table 1).",

Patients particularly from countries near the Arabian Peninsula who have an influenza-like illness should avoid travel until they are well. The following are based on CDC recommendations. If any patient has been exposed to a potential or known MERS case travel should be avoided. Household or family members exposed to potential or actual MERS cases should use masks. Such household and family members, while ill, if a family household member develops an ILI they should avoid public transportation, school, and work while ill. The individuals who are at increased risk for MERS include recent travelers from the Arabian Peninsula, particularly if such travelers develop fever and an ILI, including cough and shortness of breath, within 14 d after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Those that have had close contact with someone that has recently traveled with respiratory symptoms and fever from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula should be observed for 14 d starting from the day the patient was last exposed to the person.20 Those with increased risk for MERS also include those with close contact with a probable or confirmed case of MERS. Care should be taken with the exposed individual to monitor fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms, i.e., chills, myalgias, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea for 14 d counting from the last day of exposure to the ill contact. Healthcare personnel not utilizing proper infection control precautions are at increased risk for MERS.23,24 Close contact may be defined as any person that provides care for a patient, including healthcare workers, family members, or someone who had similarly close physical contact or any person who stayed at the same place, lived with, or visited the patient when the patient was ill.21-23 Infection control contact, and airborne precautions should be used while in close contact with symptomatic individuals or patients with MERS in the differential diagnosis.25 Infection control precautions should be observed when obtaining or conducting respiratory specimen testing for MERS. To prevent transmission to household members, masks should be worn in the house. Since person-to-person transmission has been demonstrated with MERS the use of masks and handwashing are important interventions to reduce transmission.",
