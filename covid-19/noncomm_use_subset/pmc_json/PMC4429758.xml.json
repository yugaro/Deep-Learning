A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6- through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season.",

Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged <2 years 6 months [18, 19]. In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses.
