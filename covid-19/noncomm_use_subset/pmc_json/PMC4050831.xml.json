This system has seen many changes during the past 40 years, especially since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This was due in large part to increased adoption of HL7 messaging via PHLIP. PHLIP data is detailed, standardized influenza testing information, reported in near real-time. The data received through this and other report methods is published online in national and regional aggregate form in FluView, a weekly surveillance report prepared by CDC.",

            "text": "At its starting point in 2008, adoption of PHLIP was cumbersome; the message specification was difficult to implement. To overcome this, APHL initiated a PHLIP Assistance Team (PAT) service. Since implementing the PAT, nearly 80% of reporters are coding at least one of the optional demographic and epidemiologic fields, resulting in data for new analyses, such as looking at factors affecting severity of outcome. Also, PHLIP data has been used for verification of influenza testing in order to monitor for appropriate usage of reagents provided by the ID. Five laboratories are being piloted for the use of their PHLIP influenza ELSM data in the NREVSS surveillance system to see if the message captures their other respiratory virus data. This would eliminate manual reporting for these sites through the NREVSS system at no additional expense or effort from reporters.",

Even routine analysis of the very detailed HL7 data is considerably more complex than analysis of data received using the earlier report methods (aggregate web/fax reports, .csv files). With more granular data, new surveillance questions arise that challenge the traditional ways of analyzing data, such as whether to classify the location of a case by using the patient\u2019s state of residence, the submitter of the specimen\u2019s location, or the performing laboratory\u2019s information. These new dilemmas are a fine-tuning of the existing system rather than a major shift in analysis methods and represent new opportunities for data analysis.",

The ID\u2019s experience with PHLIP has demonstrated utility and flexibility of the ELSM, beyond its initial intended use. While there were barriers that needed to be overcome for sustainable adoption, the effort is a worthwhile trade-off for what is gained in terms of quality of surveillance. The challenges that have arisen are ultimately leading to a more consistent and reliable analysis than possible with earlier reporting methods. The PHLIP model can be easily employed for other pathogens, using the lessons learned from the ID and applying them to other situations.",
