It has also spread to a number of Asian countries, as well as to Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. As a result, the Chinese government has put several major cities in Hubei Province on lockdown and has thrown plans for the Lunar New Year holiday into chaos for millions of people. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization also declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency because it could spread to countries that are not prepared.",

In the 1980s, exercise immunology was a very new subfield for exercise science. As time evolved, it has been satisfying to see how important the immune system is to the normal tissue and organ functioning and pathophysiology and how it plays a role in exercise adaptation in muscle and other tissues.",

Mice that exercised for longer durations (\u223c2.5 h/day) exhibited an increase in some illness symptoms, but there was no statistically significant difference in mortality when compared to sedentary mice.

If you are a \u201csocial exerciser\u201d, you might want to limit your exposure to exercise partners who have exhibited signs and symptoms of illness. The problem, though, is that infected people may be infectious before they exhibit symptoms. In some instances, wearing a mask while exercising may be a way to reduce your exposure. It is very important to make sure that if you are exercising on equipment in fitness facilities or gymnasiums that you make sure to disinfect the equipment before and after you use it. When done exercising, the most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water, then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 s, before rinsing and drying with a clean towel. Hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content may also be used, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns they are not effective against all germs. This strategy should be used at all times, not just because there is an acute viral outbreak. Avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later time.",

You should also seek medical care if you are experiencing those symptoms. Typically, recovery from respiratory viral infections takes 2\u20133 weeks, which corresponds with the time it takes your immune system to generate cytotoxic T cells necessary to clear the virus from infected cells.

Molecular and cellular events take place within seconds to minutes following the beginning of an exercise bout or period of physical activity. This is why there is so much work right now examining sitting time and how often physical activity should be interspersed with inactivity to promote health. The historic thinking has been that exercise promotes a fight or flight stress response that mobilizes immune cells to get ready for impending infectious or noninfectious challenges accompanied by physical activity. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective where physical activity might lead to injury or harm.",

While I believe there is merit in the evidence they provide to refute the conclusions for that population, studies where sedentary people are forced to exercise at high intensities for prolonged periods might paint a different picture. There are few such studies due to the ethics and safety concerns and there are many other variables that contribute to natural infections that would need to be accounted and controlled for in such studies. The best studies would be ones that control exercise and infectious disease exposure in people. These are difficult to ethically perform in people and it would be very difficult or impossible to get approved by institutional review boards. Animal models, including ours as mentioned, may provide valuable insights into this argument and there are many studies demonstrating that prolonged, unaccustomed exercise can increase infectious disease morbidity and mortality. These studies were not reconciled in the Campbell and Turner6 article. However, as with all animal models, there are limitations, such as species differences, stress associated with forced exercise, the type of pathogen, and timing of exercise in relation to infection that would need to be taken into account before a firm conclusion could be drawn.",

I would also caution about using cold call e-mails that do not reflect careful thought and research relative to the individual you are contacting. You should read the work and understand the research interests of the professor you are contacting while also making a case that you have strong interests and skills in this area. Most of the Chinese scholars I have mentored came to me on recommendation from someone I know and trust (e.g., another U.S. or international professor or student). Thus, it is important to create a network of people in your field of interest. You can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings. If that is not an option due to cost or circumstance, I would recommend trying to find any connection between you, your institution, or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study. As for manuscripts coming from Chinese or international laboratories submitted to English-language journals, my recommendation would be to make sure that the manuscript has been carefully edited for spelling and grammar relative to the English language.
