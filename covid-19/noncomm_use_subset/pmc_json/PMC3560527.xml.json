One particular animal host that deserves special attention is poultry, which has played a crucial role in the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 to humans. First reported in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, this virus has spread quickly from waterfowl to chickens, crows, pigeons, and other birds in Europe, Africa, and particularly Asia, leading to the deaths by infection and forced culling of millions of birds and resulting in appreciable economic losses (8).

Researchers have observed that epithelial cells in the pig trachea contain sialyloligosaccharides SA\u03b12,3 and SA\u03b12,6, which are unique host determinants for birds and humans, respectively (14). This feature confers tropism in pigs on both avian and human influenza viruses (15), allowing swine to serve as mixing vessels for antigenic shift, in which different strains infecting the same host can reassort RNA segments to create a novel viral strain (16). Such reassortments have engendered at least two major human pandemics in the 20th century, in 1957 and 1968 (17). The most recent pandemic of swine origin influenza virus (SOIV) in 2009, in particular, was a reassortant between Eurasian and North American swine lineages, and although the virus most likely came from a pig, a definitive geographic origin has yet to be determined (13, 18). Interestingly, the closest ancestors of the 2009 pandemic virus were related to viruses isolated from swine more than a decade prior (13, 19), suggesting that relevant strains circulating in swine herds have escaped detection because of inadequate sampling (18).",

One immediate approach might be to consider the absolute number of sequenced isolates, but this method fails to account for the diversity and time information of the population sampled. A comparatively large number of sequences may be insufficient to capture high genetic diversity in a pathogen population. Another possible strategy appeals to clustering techniques. After representing sequences as points in a mutational landscape, a highly clustered structure could potentially reflect highly biased sampling. Once again, this method ignores time and can be confounded by evolutionary processes like bottlenecks. A final tactic might be to measure the genetic diversity within a sample of the pathogen. Phylogenetic reconstruction and tallying of species richness is one method that characterized the subclades of avian H5N1 (8), but such analyses are cumbersome, with arbitrary boundaries for classifying clades. Techniques more grounded in information theory include Shannon\u2019s entropy and Rao\u2019s quadratic entropy (22), but high diversity in a sample does not necessarily correlate with high surveillance either.",

This measure ranks a surveillance system as more complete if it is able to capture a greater proportion of the pathogen\u2019s diversity. We apply this measure to influenza virus and compare the surveillance of different influenza virus strains in different hosts and geographic regions. We find that, compared to human seasonal strains, sampling is indeed substantially lower for swine H1N1 and avian non-H5N1 influenza virus, historically overlooked strains despite their pandemic potential. We also find that avian H5N1 influenza virus surveillance in the WHO transmission zones of northern and western Africa; eastern, southern, and southeastern Asia; and eastern, southwestern, and northern Europe is high and may potentially serve as an effective early warning system given a list of genetic determinants of mammalian adaptation. Avian H5N1 influenza virus surveillance in North America, however, is much less comprehensive. We similarly apply our methodology to other RNA viruses and show inadequate surveillance of both dengue and West Nile viruses. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of the q2 coefficient and other methods, particularly phylogenetic and clustering alternatives, and find that the q2 coefficient produces similar results with negligible computation time.",

In this report, we examine short time periods on the order of a decade and do not expect the true genetic distance to diverge greatly from the Hamming distance. However, we calculate the q2 coefficient by using a number of distance methods, including Hamming distance, Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, Tamura, Tajima-Nei, Hasegawa, and Nei-Tamura, and find little significant change (see Results). If the surveillance of a pathogen in a given time and place is sufficient, we would therefore expect a maximal number of viral isolates to have a closest ancestor in the sequence database with a sequence identity of greater than 1 \u2212 R. For the q coefficient, we chose to use t = 2 years since antigenic variant strains of influenza virus emerge and become predominant over a period of roughly 2 to 5 years (23); however, any value of t can be used. One consideration is that substitution rates can vary over time and across different lineages. To incorporate such variability into our calculation of the q2 coefficient, we used the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of the evolutionary rate collected from the literature (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (24\u201326).",

With the establishment of GISAID in 2006, both human and avian H5N1 influenza virus q2 coefficients increased further to high levels of around 0.9, affirming the effectiveness of the global consortium. Beyond 2007, however, the surveillance of human H5N1 influenza virus has waned compared to that of avian H5N1 influenza virus (Fig. 1D).

H5N1 avian influenza virus surveillance is high in northern and western Africa; eastern, southeastern, and southern Asia; and eastern, southwestern, and northern Europe.

Sequences are time ordered, however, and if we assume an approximate molecular clock, then dA < dB given that sequence A occurs before sequence B. An estimate of distance is then the larger patristic distance.

Non-H5N1 avian influenza virus has an extremely high b0 and a low q2 coefficient. It should be noted that the non-H5N1 avian influenza virus data set contains 15 different HA subtypes, as opposed to all of the other single-subtype HA data sets considered.
