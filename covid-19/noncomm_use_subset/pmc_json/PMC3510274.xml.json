This enzyme is involved in the first step of synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate signal, which allows specific targeting of lysosomal acid hydrolase from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes2-4). The lack of this enzyme precludes the generation of the common phosphomannosyl recognition marker of lysosomal enzymes1,5-10). Consequently, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are secreted into the extracellular space rather than targeted to the lysosomes. Thus, affected lysosomes are secondarily deficient in most acid hydrolases11) and are unable to degrade some macromolecules. In contrast, plasma levels of lysosomal hydrolases are high12). The resulting lysosomal storage, which was first reported in cultured fibroblasts13,14), is seen as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, particularly in mesenchymal cells, hence the term I-cell disease12,15).",

However, it has a more severe phenotype than that of Hurler disease with marked skeletal dysplasia, significant psychomotor retardation, and death within the first decade of life12,16). The diagnosis is established by detection of markedly elevated activities of lysosomal enzymes in the serum and/or low activities of lysosomal enzymes in fibroblasts. Characteristic inclusions can be observed in cultured fibroblasts under light microscopy17,18). This disease is caused by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase \u03b1/\u03b2-subunits precursor gene (GNPTAB) mutations19), which are associated with complete loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity20).",

The distal metaphyses of long tubular bones showed irregular demineralization, which is seen in rickets. These signs suggest the presence of hyperparathyroidism, which was confirmed by the high levels of ALP and PTH. However, in contrast to neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, her total Ca level was normal. These observations are consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The etiology of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in fetuses and newborns with ML II is uncertain. However, it is speculated that the enzyme-targeting defect in ML II involves trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta; this interferes with transplacental Ca transport and leads to Ca starvation of the fetus and activation of the parathyroid response to maintain extracellular Ca18). This hypothesis is supported by the findings of foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in the present case.",

ML II correlates with an almost total absence of phosphotransferase activity resulting from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity due to frameshift or nonsense mutations in the GNPTAB gene. However, the presence of at least 1 hypomorph (a missense or splicing site mutation) allele in the GNPTAB mutant genotype results in a clinically milder form of ML III alpha/beta with a low level of phosphotransferase activity3). The same result was reported in a Korean study26). We performed a genetic study by direct sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of GNPTAB. We identified compound heterozygosity in the GNPTAB gene: a combination of a nonsense mutation (c.3091C>T [p.Arg1031X]) and a frameshift by a small insertion or duplication (c.3456_3459dupCAAC [p.Ile1154GlnfsX3]). We confirmed the diagnosis as ML II because the hypomorph allele was not present. The nonsense mutation was inherited from the father, and the frameshift mutation was inherited from the mother.
