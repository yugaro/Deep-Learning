Genetic RNA recombination contributes to viral evolution and biogenesis (Koonin, Dolja, and Krupovic 2015), evident in many groups of plus-sense RNA viruses in animals (Weiss and Schlesinger 1991; Graham and Baric 2010; Lukashev 2010), plants (reviewed in Bujarski 2013), and bacteria (Palasingam and Shaklee 1992), in negative-sense (Han and Worobey 2011), double-stranded (Krupovic, Dolja, and Koonin 2015), and retroviruses (Delviks-Frankenberry et al. 2011), and in defective-interfering RNAs (Sandoval et al. 2008).",

In Brome mosaic virus (BMV), the extensive recombination events between different BMV RNA segments have been described (Bujarski and Kaesberg 1986; Bujarski 2013). Both viral RNA sequences and viral and host proteins do contribute to BMV RNA recombination. A recombination hot spot at the 3\u2032-UTR of all three RNA segments regulates BMV RNA replication, recombination, and virion assembly (Rao and Kao 2015). Another hot spot maps to the intercistronic region in RNA3 (Wierzchoslawski et al. 2003). In Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), recombination events among natural isolates were detected in different regions of the CMV genome (Nouri et al. 2014). Also, Pita and Roossinck (2013) observed inter-strain recombinants in the CMV reassortants.",

For barley, the sequencing data covered only Fragments 1 and 2, with an RF of 6 per cent. Full sequence coverage of RNA2 from N. benthamiana and C. quinoa revealed five regions of increased crossover activity, with Regions II\u2013IV within the 2a (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) protein ORF. Interestingly, the GDD RdRp motif was recombinationally silent. Hot spots I and V were in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs, respectively, with the RFNs higher in hot spot I, reaching the highest value in N. benthamiana (RFN = 0.175%). Interestingly, all the hot spots mapped to similar regions of RNA2 in all three hosts. The statistical relationship between the RFN data sets for RNA2 was significant for pair of N. benthamiana versus C. quinoa, with correlation coefficient 0.38 and P value 0.0098, differing significantly from other much lower coefficients (Table 1). This suggests that RNA2 recombined in a similar way in both hosts. The regions between the hot spots were less active, again located at similar positions for both hosts. For pairs of barley versus C. quinoa and barley versus N. benthamiana, there were lower correlation coefficients and higher P values (Table 1), likely due to incomplete data from barley.\n\n",

Barley protoplasts have been used in the past to study BMV RNA replication (Sivakumaran, Hema, and Kao 2003; Sztuba-Solinska and Bujarski 2008). Mixtures of F and R BMV RNAs were co-transfected onto barley protoplasts, and the BMV RNA2 and RNA3 components were amplified by RT-PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing. The protoplasts were inoculated with two different ratios (1F to 1R and 3F to 1R ratio) of BMV RNAs. It has been reported previously that the composition of the BMV RNA inoculum influences the recombinant profiles (Kwon and Rao 2012). To analyze RNA2 recombinants, forty-one clones from the 1F to1R ratio were sequenced and six recombinants were identified, corresponding to an RF of 15 per cent (Fig. 5A, blue line). For hot spots I, II, and III, the distribution of crossovers followed the patterns found for RNA2 in whole barley plants. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the pairs of barley plants versus 1F to 1R protoplasts and N. benthamiana versus 1F to 1R protoplasts (Table 1) were high (0.437 at P = 0.023 and 0.652 at P = 1.21E-06, respectively). However, those for 1F to 1R and 3F to 1R protoplasts correlated to a much lesser extent with the plant hosts. Hot spot Ia (nts 340\u2013484) was much more active in barley protoplasts than in whole plants. Interestingly, both hot spots Ia and V disappeared for the 3F to 1R inoculum ratio (yellow lines). Also, the RF increased to 36 per cent with the 3F to 1R ratio. Overall, these observations not only reveal limited effect of the host on recombinant spots but also suggest some role of the initial availability of viral RNAs for recombination.\n\n",

For 1F to 1R ratio, seventy clones were sequenced, with an RF of 24 per cent. Both 1F to 3R and 3F to 1R ratios had similar RFs (22 and 20%, respectively). Similar to whole barley plants, five active regions were mapped (hot spots I\u2013V, Fig. 5B), including the 3a ORF, the intercistronic region, and a short region at the N-side of the CP ORF. However, there were significant differences at hot spots II, III, and IV. Hot spot II had its highest RFN value for 1F to 3R ratio (black line) and the lowest for 3F to 1R ratio (yellow lines). At the intercistronic region (hot spot III), the 1F to 1R ratio (blue line) supported the highest RFN, whereas the 3F to 1R ratio had the lowest RFN. The observed hot spot activity in the intercistronic region confirmed our prior observations (Wierzchoslawski et al. 2003; Wierzchoslawski, Dzianott, and Bujarski 2004). For hot spot IV, the 3F to 1R ratio had the highest RFN, but the 1F to 3R ratio had no recombinants. Significantly, a central portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350\u20131598) did not support recombination with any of the three F to R ratios in protoplasts or in whole barley plants. Apparently, there were some constraints, of a mechanistic rather than of a selection-based nature that prevented crossovers at these locations. The correlation coefficients between barley plants and both 1F to 1R and 1F to 3R protoplasts were high (0.520 and 0.580, respectively) at high confidence (P = 0.039 and P = 0.019, respectively). Also, the patterns between protoplasts 1F to 1R and 1F to 3R correlated well with each other (0.644 at P = 0.007). It remains to be demonstrated whether recombination of RNA1 in barley protoplasts is as low as in barley plants (shown in Fig. 2).",

In HIV-1, studies have revealed a clear bias for more frequent recombination inside hairpins than in regions outside hairpin structures (Simon-Loriere et al. 2010). Our studies show that one large portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350\u20131598, Figs 4 and 5A) represented a low crossover frequency region in RNA3, in both barley plants and protoplasts. It remains to be determined whether the folding of this region reveals a structural complexity similar to that of recombination-active regions. If yes, then the RNA folding complexity would not be the sole determinant of the crossover frequency. Both host and viral factors may contribute to recombination activity at the hot spots (Knies et al. 2008). It has been shown that the binding of both CP and replicase proteins to PE and the intercistronic regions of RNA3 affect recombination (Sztuba-Solinska et al. 2012). For Tobacco bushy stunt virus, various cellular pathways and factors were found to be major drivers of viral recombination in yeast (Nagy 2011), affecting the \u2018molecular crowdedness\u2019 within the viral replicase (Nagy and Pogany 2011).",

The locations of nt differences (markers) on the BMV RNA sequence, the calculation, plotting, and depicting the ORFs all are as those in Figs 2 and 3. Two different ratios of F to R BMV RNA inoculums were tested for RNA2, and three ratios were tested for RNAs 3 inocula: 1F to 1R (blue line), 3F to 1R (yellow line), and 1F to 3R (black line). The separately sequenced areas of cDNA clones are depicted with dashed lines below. The numerals at the bottom show total numbers of cDNA clones sequenced and the total RF values (%).",
