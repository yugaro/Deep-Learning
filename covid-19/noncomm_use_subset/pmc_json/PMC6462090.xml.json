The crystal structure of the USP9X CD (amino acids 1,551\u20131,970) was solved at 2.5-\u00c5 resolution in space group P21 using the USP7 CD as a molecular replacement search model. The asymmetric unit contains four copies of USP9X that show a noncrystallographic pseudo C2 symmetry. Electron density for residues 1,593\u20131,631, 1,839\u20131,858, 1,891\u20131,895, and 1,959\u20131,960 of chain A and similar regions in chains B, C, and D is not observed, and these regions are presumably disordered (Fig. 1 A and B). Chain A in the asymmetric unit was used in structural analysis unless otherwise specified. A Dali search (25) revealed the core structure of USP9X is closest to the USP7 CD, with an rmsd of about 2.4 \u00c5 over 350 aligned amino acids and a z-score of 34. The overall structure represents a canonical USP fold, comprising thumb, palm, and fingers subdomains (Fig. 1B). Additional features common to other USP CDs are also found in USP9X. For example, the tip of the fingers subdomain contains a CHC2-type ZnF motif with a zinc ion coordinated by residues Cys1727, His1729, Cys1771, and Cys1774 arranged in a tetrahedron (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Unexpectedly, a nearby Cys1724 is not involved, as seen in other known USP structures, where the zinc is coordinated by four cysteines.",

Notably, a Gln1683 residue is positioned close (3.6 \u00c5) to the catalytic Cys1566 in the apo structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). It must adopt a different rotamer conformation to accommodate the C terminus of a Ub substrate as observed for an equivalent Gln293 in the USP7\u2013Ub complex structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Interestingly, Gln1683 is conserved among USP DUBs and often with a juxtaposed second Gln residue. Close to the active site, USP9X contains two blocking loops, BL1 (1,801\u20131,810) connecting \u03b213 and \u03b214 and BL2 (1,872\u20131,879) connecting \u03b216 and \u03b217 (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2), similar to those in USP7 (5\u20137, 26) that form the binding cleft for the C-terminal tail of Ub. A unique USP9X \u03b2-hairpin insertion is located next to the two blocking loops (Fig. 1B), suggesting the insertion may have some effect on the recognition of the Ub tail. Interestingly, a loop connecting helices \u03b14 and \u03b15, which corresponds to the switching loop of USP7 (6), is 2 aa longer than that of USP7, and protrudes into space otherwise occupied by the C-terminal activating tail in USP7 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). The extension may exclude a regulatory mechanism similar to that of USP7 (6).",

A 39-aa insertion (1,593\u20131,631) between boxes 1 and 2 (helices \u03b12 and \u03b13), and a 22-aa insertion (1,838\u20131,859) between boxes 4 and 5 (helix \u03b18 and strand \u03b216) (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2) cannot be traced in the electron density map and are presumably disordered. The importance of these loops remains unclear, but a high percentage of negatively charged Asp and Glu residues in the \u03b12\u2013\u03b13 loop may be of significance. A third 20-aa insertion (1,924\u20131,943) between \u03b19 and \u03b222 within box 6 forms an unexpected \u03b2-hairpin structure in the palm subdomain of the USP fold. Sequence alignment revealed the \u03b2-hairpin insertion is completely conserved among USP9X from different species, as well as in the related USP9Y, whereas the two other insertions are not (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). This suggests the \u03b2-hairpin insertion may be functionally important. Analysis of the evolutionary conservation profile of USP9X CD using ConSurf algorithm (27) indicates the active site, the Ub C-terminal tail binding region, and a patch of the fingers subdomain, are highly conserved (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).",

Both USP9X and the K63 and M1 dual-specific USP, CYLD, have a large insertion within sequence box 6. The insertion in CYLD forms helices/bend structural elements (28) located next to the two blocking loops and also extends a \u03b2-hairpin in the palm subdomain that contributes to proximal Ub recognition (8). Similarly, the insertion in USP9X may also be involved in polyUb chain specificity. Furthermore, the fingers subdomain of some USPs is known to bind to a distal Ub of a polyUb chain, as shown in the USP21-linear diUb complex (9). Based on structural modeling and comparison with other USPs, we postulate that the USP9X CD may harbor three Ub binding sites (S2, S1, and S1\u2032) (Fig. 1B) and cleave a polyUb chain linkage-dependently.",

Unlike some other USPs that show cross-activities toward UBLs, such as SUMO and ISG15 (29, 30), USP9X is only active toward Ub, with no measurable activity for SUMO1-, NEDD8-, or ISG15-AMC (Fig. 1D). Using the Ub-AMC substrate, we determined the kinetic parameters for USP9X CD with kcat = 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 min\u22121 and Km = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A and Table S1). The kcat and Km of USP9X CD are vastly different from those of the USP7 CD (kcat = 4.6 min\u22121 and Km = 44.2 \u00b5M) (31). The specificity constant (kcat/Km) of USP9X (2.5 min\u22121\u00b5M\u22121) is 25-fold higher than that of USP7 CD (0.10 min\u22121\u00b5M\u22121). We next assessed the activity of USP9X CD toward eight diUb substrates of different linkages. USP9X CD displayed various cleavage efficiencies, with a preference for K11-, K63-, K48-, and K6-linkages (Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). Low level of cleavage was observed for K27-, K29-, and K33-diUbs and no cleavage observed for M1-linked diUb (Fig. 1E). We further assessed the cleavage of K6-, K11-, K63-, K48-linked tetraUb substrates and observed that K11-linked tetraUb was processed more efficiently than K63- or K48-linked chains, with poor cleavage of K6-linked tetraUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C).",

We previously reported K48- and K63-diUb probes with an internal MA (32), which are now denoted K48- or K63-diUb-MA1. In this study, we additionally generated K6- and K11-diUb-MA1 ABPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).

To probe the Ub binding at a potential S2 site in DUBs, we prepared K6-, K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb probes that contain an NC linker (33) and a terminal propargylamine (PA) warhead (diUb-NC1-PA2) (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6).

Unlike the CYLD insertion that is partially disordered in the apo structure and induced into an extended \u03b2-hairpin upon substrate binding (8, 28), the USP9X \u03b2-hairpin insertion is ordered in the apo structure. Crystal packing analysis revealed the \u03b2-hairpin pairs with the \u03b2-strands of the fingers subdomain of a symmetry-related molecule (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A). Secondary structure (34) and disorder (35) predictions suggest this insertion has no strong propensity to adopt an \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-strand, or disordered conformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 B and C). This implicates that the observed conformation of the \u03b2-hairpin could have been influenced by crystal packing, and it may adopt a different conformation upon substrate binding. Structure overlay of USP9X CD with CYLD CD in complex with diUb (PDB ID code 3WXE) shows that the USP9X \u03b2-hairpin is close to, but on the opposite side of a modeled S1\u2032 Ub compared with the CYLD \u03b2-hairpin (Fig. 3A).",

To probe the effect of simultaneous binding of a polyUb substrate to all three potential DUB Ub binding sites (S2, S1, and S1\u2032, mode 1), we used the triUb-NC1-CL2 probes (Fig. 2B), cleavage of which indicates an endo-mode. We found that USP9X CD endo-cleaved K11- and K63-triUb-NC1-CL2 into diUb and monoUb efficiently (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S14 A and B). However, little cleavage of K48 triUb-NC1-CL2 was detected (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S14C). These assays were run in parallel with native diUb substrates, and for all linkages (K11, K48, and K63) efficient cleavage by the USP9X CD was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). We also used USP2 CD, which is permissive for different Ub chain linkages, as a comparison and observed efficient cleavage of triUb-NC1-CL2 of all three linkages (K11, K48, and K63) (SI Appendix, Fig. S14).",

We envisioned three possible outcomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S15A) In scenario 1, the DUB engages the triUb substrate in a binding mode that leads to endo-cleavage of the triUb-MA1-CL2 to yield di- and monoUb species. The resulting diUb-MA1 probe may in turn label the DUB. In scenario 2, the DUB engages the triUb substrate exclusively in an exo-binding mode that leads to the labeling of DUB by the triUb probe. In scenario 3, both endo- or exo-binding modes are possible, and it will lead to simultaneous cleavage of the triUb at the native isopeptide bond and labeling by the warhead in the triUb probe. For K48 triUb-MA1-CL2, we observed no cleavage by USP9X CD but a robust labeling product in a time-course experiment (Fig. 5C). The identity of the upshifted labeling product band was confirmed by comparison with labeling of USP9X CD using K48-diUb-MA1 probe (SI Appendix, Fig. S15B), consistent with scenario 2. For K63-triUb-MA1-CL2, both cleavages of and labeling by the triUb were observed (Fig. 5D), agreeing with scenario 3. For K11-triUb-MA1-CL2, a robust cleavage of the triUb probe was observed with a low level of labeling product (Fig. 5D), suggesting a dominant scenario 2.",

The structure of USP9X CD and the functional studies using novel Ub-based probes implicate three potential Ub binding sites (S1, S2, and S1\u2032) in USP9X CD. Some USPs contain a C4-type ZnF at the tip of the fingers subdomain. Only in USP21 was it shown structurally that the ZnF is involved in binding the S2 Ub in a polyUb chain. Our ZnF mutagenesis and ABP labeling data suggest that an S2 Ub binding site likely exists in USP9X. CYLD contains a distinctive truncated fingers subdomain without a ZnF motif and a large insertion in box 6. The reduced binding surface of the fingers subdomain and the insertion render specificities for the more flexible linear and K63-linked polyUbs through S1 and S1\u2032 sites. Similarly, a large, conserved insertion of USP9X within box 6 is also involved in the specific recognition of the proximal Ub of a polyUb chain. There exist two other less conserved, large insertions in the USP9X CD that are disordered in the crystal structure, located farther away from the catalytic binding cleft and may have other unknown functions.",

Conversely, several other USPs showed cross-reactivity toward ISG15 and SUMO (29, 30). The recent crystal structure of USP18 in complex with ISG15 provided a structure-based explanation (10). A hydrophobic patch in ISG15 centered on Trp121, Pro128, and His149 interacts with complementary hydrophobic residues in USP18. Unlike ISG15, Ub contains polar residues (Arg42, Gln49, and Val70) at these ISG15 equivalent sites, which would complement polar residues found in Ub-reactive USPs such as USP7 (10). Like USP7, USP9X also contains polar residues at this binding interface that would be unfavorable for ISG15 (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). Neither is USP9X active against NEDD8, the most homologous UBL to Ub. The complex structure of USP21 with linear diUb provided insight into how USP21 distinguishes Ub from NEDD8 (9). A conserved Glu304 residue in USP21 interacts specifically with the guanidinium group of Arg72 of Ub C-terminal tail. The equivalent position in NEDD8 is an Ala. A secondary polar patch of USP21 (Glu427 and Lys448) in the fingers subdomain interact with the \u03b21/\u03b22 loop of Ub but would clash sterically with and repel the larger, charged residues in NEDD8. Not surprisingly, USP9X is conserved at both sites (Glu1688 and Asp1761/Lys1782), which explains why NEDD8 is not a substrate for USP9X.",

We noticed the side chain of Gln1683 in the switching loop forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of the catalytic Cys1566 and the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly1878 in the neighboring blocking loop BL2 and blocks the entrance of Ub C terminus to the active site cleft (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). For comparison, in the USP7/Ub-aldehyde complex structure, the switching loop in USP7 adopts an \u201cout-conformation\u201d (6), and the equivalent Gln293 is positioned away from the catalytic cysteine (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Gln1683Ala mutation did not increase the kcat of USP9X CD, but rather significantly increased Km toward monoUb substrate. Kinetics of cleavage assay of IQF-K11 diUb substrate did not show any significant differences between the Q1683A mutant and the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C). These observations suggest that Gln1683 is more important for the binding of the Ub tail of a monoUb to the catalytic cleft than for the native isopeptide in diUb or polyUb substrates. Instead, the interaction between the proximal Ub and the potential USP9X CD S1\u2032 site may help to orient the isopeptide of a diUb in the catalytic cleft for cleavage.",

Cys1808 is in blocking loop BL1 and 19 \u00c5 away from the catalytic cysteine. A groove between BL1 and BL2 loops likely traps the diUb isopeptide in a nonproductive conformation (Fig. 4C) and places Cys1808 in proximity to the warhead for labeling. This specific labeling event by a noncatalytic cysteine residue revealed a possible search motion of the flexible S1 Ub C-terminal tail and the attached proximal Ub during active site engagement (Fig. 4C). The elongated \u03b2-hairpin insertion likely restricts the motion of the proximal Ub and entraps the isopeptide into the groove between BL1 and BL2, leading to the labeling of Cys1808 by the MA warhead in the K11-diUb-MA1 probe (Fig. 4C). By this notion, the removal of \u03b2-hairpin insertion in USP9X CD resulted in reduced labeling efficiency of Cys1808 by the K11-diUb-MA1 probe (Fig. 4A), likely due to reduced contact time of the MA warhead with Cys1808. Furthermore, a Gln1683Ala mutation in USP9X, intended to unblock the active site cleft, improved the active site Cys1566 labeling markedly (SI Appendix, Fig. S13A), mimicking the effect of \u03b2-hairpin deletion albeit with greater efficiency. Differently, we observed preference of Cys1808 labeling over the catalytic Cys1566 by K11-diUb-MA1 probe in the USP9X ZnF mutant (Fig. 4A). This observation suggests that the interaction between the USP9X ZnF and the Ub N-terminal region may influence the binding mode of the S1 Ub C-terminal tail and the attached proximal Ub.",

When comparing the endo- and exo-modes of Ub chain processing using the triUb-MA1-CL2 probes, we found that an exo-cleavage is exclusively preferred for K48-polyUb chain. For K11-triUb chain, USP9X CD prefers endo- over exo-cleavage. These observations revealed linkage-dependent polyUb cleavage modes of the USP9X CD. Our results also suggest that the unique \u03b2-hairpin in box 6 facilitates the efficient endo-cleavage of K63-polyUb chain based on the reduced cleavage of K63-linked triUb-NC1-CL2 by the USP9X \u03b2-hairpin deletion mutant (Fig. 5E).",

            "text": "Interestingly, multiple E3 ligases are known to interact with USP9X, including HECT-type E3 ligases ITCH and SMURF1, and RING-type E3 ligases MARCH7, Mind bomb 1, and TRIM25 (16\u201318, 36, 37). The formation of an E3 ligase and DUB complex is a recurring theme observed for many DUBs and probably plays a role in more precise control of substrate ubiquitination and the chain linkages through trimming and editing. OTU-type DUB A20 contains both a ligase domain and a DUB domain and shows an exo-cleavage preference for K48-chain and endo-cleavage activity for the K63-chain, presumably allowing the assembly of an intact degradation signal (K48) while maintaining rapid control of signaling event through the K63-polyUb chain (38). USP9X plays multiple roles in cell cycle, endocytosis, and degradation. The endo-cleavage preference for K11- and exo-cleavage preference for K48-polyUb chains of USP9X may fit in its role in the different cellular processes, which needs to be further tested in a cellular system.",

            "text": "In summary, while monoUb and diUbs provide a snapshot of substrate recognition by DUBs, our activity-based hybrid triUb probes allow deeper interrogation of the polyUb chain binding modes of USP9X and reveal interesting details. Linkage-dependent endo- and exo-Ub chain cleavage modes were clearly defined using the two types of hybrid triUb probes. We propose a model where the USP9X CD accommodates a chain of three Ubs, with the distal and proximal Ubs occupying the S2 and S1\u2032 sites close to the ZnF motif and \u03b2-hairpin insertion, respectively (Fig. 5A). A structure-based triUb recognition model has previously been proposed for the human OTU subfamily DUBs and SARS PLpro (39, 40). In our USP9X model, whereas the ZnF motif is rigid, the extended \u03b2-hairpin insertion is presumably flexible and may impart specificity for different chain topologies. PolyUb chains can bind USP9X in three distinct modes, which could dictate the endo- versus exo-cleavage specificity (Fig. 5A). A potential binding groove between BL1 and BL2, revealed by the specific labeling of the noncatalytic Cys1808, suggests an intriguing possibility that USP9X CD may recognize a branched polyUb chain, such as K11/K63 (41). This remains to be tested in future studies. Overall, the USP9X CD provides a fascinating example of small, yet important structural features that may dictate the polyUb chain linkage specificity and influence the dynamics of polyUb binding and recognition by the USP catalytic core.",

Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All USP9X proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain grown in Terrific Broth using a LEX bioreactor (Epiphyte3) or in LB media using a shaker incubator. Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C until the OD600 reached 1.5 and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18 \u00b0C overnight using the LEX bioreactor. Alternatively, shaker flask culture was grown at 37 \u00b0C until the OD600 reached 0.6 and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at 16 \u00b0C overnight. For USP9X purification, all buffers were adjusted to pH 8.0 at room temperature. Harvested cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and benzamidine and lysed using sonication for 10 min with 5-/7-s on/off cycles (Sonicator 3000; Misonix). The crude extract was then centrifuged at 36,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The protein was batch-absorbed using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), washed with 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, and eluted with an elution buffer (25 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP). The His6-tag was removed by overnight incubation with His6-tagged TEV protease during dialysis in 25 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Uncleaved protein and the TEV protease were removed by passing through Ni-NTA resin, and the target protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q; GE Healthcare).
