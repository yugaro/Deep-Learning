Studies of pneumonia frequently report low levels of pathogen identification, although improved knowledge of pneumonia aetiology is essential for the development of targeted management and effective public health strategies such as vaccination [3, 4]. In the UK, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced routinely in September 2006 and replaced by PCV13 from April 2010. The vaccine schedule is three doses administered at 2, 4 and 13 months of age. When first introduced, those over and under 1 year of age received one and two doses, respectively, as part of a catch-up programme for children aged <2 years.",

Conventional methods such as blood culture and serology often have limited sensitivity due to inadequate sample volume or lack of convalescent sera [3]. Molecular diagnostics are now routinely used in the assessment of viral respiratory infections and similar techniques have been developed for the detection of bacterial respiratory infections [6, 7]. Resti\net al. [8] demonstrated a significant improvement in the identification of pneumococcal pneumonia in children by PCR on blood samples (15.4%) when applied simultaneously with blood culture (3.8%). In a recent study of Italian children aged <5 years, overall bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia was identified in 14.3%, which was established by PCR in 92%, blood culture in 1% and both in 7% of subjects [9].",

We present data from studies conducted over two periods, before (2001\u20132002) and after (2009\u20132011) the addition of PCV. These were designed to describe the proportion of causative pathogens in paediatric CAP and describe how the identification of causative pathogens could be improved with the application of more PCR-based assays. As disease incidence declined, a longer recruitment period in the post-vaccine study was therefore planned, in order to have a larger cohort with representative aetiological data.",

They consented and were enrolled in the aetiological study with an extended panel of investigations. Written informed consent was obtained from parents and assent obtained from older children.

Approximately 4 weeks later blood was collected for convalescent serology. Parents often declined returning for these convalescent samples (all in the post-vaccine study), contributing to the variability in the number of investigations performed. Nasopharyngeal secretions included aspirates from infants, and/or swabs from older children. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were placed in 0.9% sodium chloride transport solution or swabs (Medical Wire and Equipment Co. Ltd, Corsham, UK). Tracheobronchial secretions (collected via endotracheal tube or bronchoalveolar lavage) and pleural fluid were tested when obtained. The nature of the collected samples were standardised across all ages and in both studies. Recovery of bacterial pathogens from nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum or by urinary pneumococcal antigen was not considered evidence of definite infection, due to the risk of physiological colonisation [3, 13]. Therefore, only positive results that were classified as likely causative pathogens of pneumonia according to defined diagnostic criteria are presented and discussed (table 1). Any positive results from the potentially colonised above-mentioned sites were added together separately and rates were grouped among \u201cunknown causes\u201d in figure 1 for the reader\u2019s information.",

Additionally, pneumococcal pneumolysin DNA can be detected in the blood of healthy children colonised with pneumococcus [26]. The pneumolysin gene can also be detected in non-pneumococcal Viridans-group streptococci, particularly S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis [5]. Potential confounders resulting from using a pneumolysin PCR in this study therefore include false positives associated with pneumococcal carriage or cross-reactivity with other Viridans-group streptococci. Given the very low pneumococcal carriage rate in this population (7%), the former is unlikely. Although not well explored, viral carriage is also a clinical possibility, leading to positive PCR results that do not necessarily correlate to the observed pneumonia [27]. Hence the results of PCR-based approaches can be limited in making a definite diagnosis of causative pathogens in pneumonia.",

Improvement of pneumococcal identification with the application of PCR when compared to culture alone is consistent with previous studies [9, 28\u201330]. This is similar to the reported increase in a recent Italian study (from 3.8% to 15.4%) [8]. It is interesting that despite the overall decrease in the incidence and hospitalisation of pneumonia since the introduction of PCV7 [31, 32], the rates of pneumococcal infection were comparable between the two studies. Replacement with non-PCV7 serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease is well recognised [33], and this may explain our findings in the face of reduction in disease incidence. Where pneumococcal serotyping was possible, with the majority being identified from pleural fluids, all serotypes recovered were non-PCV7 but included in PCV13. This is similar to data from the USA on children with empyema, where 98% were non-PCV7 serotypes and primarily similar to the serotypes in our study [34]. Despite the lack of comprehensive serotype data, this suggests that PCV13 could substantially reduce invasive pneumococcal disease [35, 36].",

In keeping with previous findings, group A Streptococcus can be found in up to 7% of children with pneumonia, compared to 7% and 10.5%, respectively, in the pre- and post-vaccination datasets [19, 39]. With the introduction of PCV and decrease in pneumococcal pneumonia it is possible that the relative proportion of bacteria such as group A Streptococcus and S. aureus, as well as M. pneumoniae causing severe pneumonia will increase.",

This was followed by rhinovirus, influenza and adenovirus at \u223c7% each, similar to data previously described for the same region [19]. Diagnosis of viral infection was achieved mainly through the testing of respiratory secretions rather than by serology, which was only positive in seven children with influenza A virus. The improvement in the detection of viruses in the post-vaccine study was mainly achieved by the application of PCR assays for respiratory viral screening. Most of the viruses detected were identified in those aged <5 years, consistent with other studies [2, 23]. In the post-vaccine study, viral screening was expanded to include eight viruses with their subgroups, including pandemic H1N1, and to delineate their contribution in causing CAP in children in the UK. Considering the timing of the second recruitment period, pandemic influenza A H1N1 as a single pathogen was not implicated in many cases of pneumonia. The low isolation rates of bocavirus, coronavirus and hMPV highlight the minimal contribution of these viruses to the aetiology of pneumonia in children in the UK. The rates of mixed viral\u2013bacterial infection were variable between the two studies and likely to be dependent on the screening methods used to identify the causative pathogens [3].",

Although the post-vaccine study covered two winter seasons, the numbers of children enrolled were fewer than in the pre-vaccine study, which could be a true reflection of decreased disease incidence and hospitalisation. The findings from the post-vaccine study may have been hampered by the lack of convalescent sera, which may have led to the underestimation of the role of atypical bacteria in paediatric pneumonia, but this effect is probably minimal as Mycoplasma infection was only detected in three children by paired serum samples in the pre-vaccine study. Lack of serotype data of the identified pneumococci from the pre-vaccine study limits the true comparison with the serotype profile after the implementation of the conjugate vaccine. Another limitation is the variation between the two studies in the diagnostic methods used and the pathogens investigated, which makes the interpretation of comparative findings guarded. The significant improvement in pathogen identification by the application of more PCR assays adds further evidence to the importance of using these techniques to monitor changes in the epidemiology of paediatric CAP and pneumococcal serotype replacement.",

The combined use of culture, serology and PCR-based diagnostic tests significantly improved the identification of causative pathogens in paediatric CAP. Replacement of PCV7 with PCV13 was likely to be associated with as significant a reduction in pneumococcal disease as non-PCV7, but PCV13 serotypes predominated. This requires continued surveillance to monitor for the emergence of serotype replacement.",
