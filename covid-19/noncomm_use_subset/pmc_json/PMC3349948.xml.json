Their surfaces are composed by a lipid envelope, originated from the plasmatic membrane of infected epithelial cells, and two antigenic proteins: Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA); these two antigens exhibit higher variability compared with their remaining proteins [1]. Depending on the extent of variability of two surface proteins, until now are known 16 HA (H1-H16), and 9 NA genotypes (N1-N9), respectively, which can be combined in different combinations [1, 2].",

In mid April, the Centers for Disease Control from USA identified the new virus in two cases from California. The new virus spread rapidly throughout the world, and as a consequence the WHO authorities declared the \u201cPandemic (H1N1) 2009\u201d on June 11, 2009 [3]. It is thought that the new 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (from here, 2009 H1N1pdm) has emerged through at least four reassortment and transmission events among swine, avian and human H1N1 lineages, probably in Asia and North America [4]. Particularly, the HA segment of 2009 H1N1pdm was originated from American swine lineage, whereas the NA segment derived from the European swine lineage [5, 6]. It is believed that the ancestors of this pandemic strain remained undetected for approximately one decade due to lack of a surveillance system in pigs, the historical \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for new influenza viruses. Furthermore, the closest ancestors of the new pandemic strains emerged probably in January 2009 [4].",

This is in accordance with its short period of time of circulation in humans [13]. The single clustering of 2009 H1N1pdm observed in this report, however, is in contrast with other studies [14], in which the authors observe differences by using small datasets of sequences. The single clustering of 2009 H1N1pdm, furthermore, agrees with serological data in which it was observed that antigenically, the new pandemic viruses were all similar [6], and thus not requiring a new update of the vaccine (strain A/California/07/2009) until now.",

The amino acid S220, though not exposed to the surface, is localized in the receptor binding domain (RBD), and its change could affect the transmissibility and infectivity of H1N1 in humans. The fixed mutation, S220T, has been found at high percentage (76.7%) in this study. To test whether change 220T could contribute to antigenic drift, it would be interesting to compare its antigenic profile against a wildtype isolate (S220). This mutation, probably, has become fixed in all pandemic strains through optimization of viral fitness, rather than immune selection or adaptation to the host.",

Substitution E391K, found at 15.6% in our study, has been identified as part of a highly conserved epitope in the 1918 H1N1 virus with a possible role in membrane fusion [22]. Another proximal substitution found in other studies, N387H, was found in only 1.7% of our sequences.",

We found both mutations at high percentages, 85.1% and 85.9% respectively, in our dataset. Change 106I was present in the 20th century cases of H1N1 (in 1918 [pandemic], and 1977), as well as 248D (in 1977). Since residue at position 248 is located at the drug target domain (DTD) region, as residue 275, it could potentially affect the sensitivity to NA inhibitors. Another substitution of possible interest in NA sequences is D199N, which was previously associated with an increase in oseltamivir resistance in both seasonal and H5N1 virus strains [24]. We found, however, only 4 out of 1273 NA sequences (0.3%) containing this change. The rare substitution I223R, which was reported in association with resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir [25], was also found in only 2 out of 1273 NA sequences (0.2%). Substitution H275Y has been related to oseltamivir resistance, especially in immunocompromised or severely ill persons [26]. It was found, however, in sporadic cases in most of the countries at low frequencies (~1%) [27]. In our study, we found 2% of sequences containing this change.",
