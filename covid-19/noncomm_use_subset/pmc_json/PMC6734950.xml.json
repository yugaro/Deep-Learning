However, the construction of primary healthcare services has never caught up with this expansion of new communities (Liu et al, 2006). Since the health input mainly went to the big hospitals, primary healthcare, including mental healthcare, was largely ignored by the medical service (Li et al, 2005). Patients with a mental illness were invisible, other than if they murdered someone or did some other awful act in the neighbourhood. Part of the job of the local police was to identify any mentally ill people deemed prone to violence and to send them to a psychiatric hospital.",

The deficiency was exposed during the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, which nearly became pandemic in 2002\u20133): because the primary healthcare system did not work as a gatekeeper, people were able to rush directly to tertiary hospitals, where they could either become infected or infect others (Hu, 2003; Li & Hu, 2004). The government was aware of the importance of community healthcare and prepared to reform the whole system (Central People\u2019s Government, 2006). However, the challenges were huge, especially in the case of mental health. First, primary health provision in the communities faced the twin barrier of poorly trained staff (most of them had never received any training in mental health) and poorly equipped clinics. Second, neither social security nor medical insurance covered any expenses except for medication and hospitalisation \u2013 mental health services in communities such as follow-up, day care, family support, occupational therapy and social training were not covered. Third, social stigma was the big barrier: primary clinics were reluctant to provide mental healthcare and most communities were not happy to share health resources with patients who were mentally ill (Yang et al, 1998).",

Mental healthcare in China is mainly hospital-based: individuals are admitted to psychiatric hospitals at their first episode, on either a voluntary or an involuntary basis. There they are medicated and there they return at the second and subsequent episodes. They may eventually become permanent residents of these institutions. It has been estimated that, of the moderately or severely disabled individuals with a diagnosable mental illness, only 8% have ever sought professional help, and only 5% have ever seen a mental health professional (Phillips et al, 2009).",
