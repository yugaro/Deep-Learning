SARS continues to be a serious concern as long as there is no vaccine or effective drug. SCV is a single-stranded (ss) RNA positive-strand virus with a genome of 29 727 nt (2,3). A single 21.2-kb replicase gene at the 5\u2032-end region of the SCV genome is translated into two large replicative polyproteins, pp1ab (\u223c790 kDa) and pp1a (\u223c490 kDa), which is generated with and without ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121), respectively (4,5). These two translational products are subsequently processed by the viral main protease termed Mpro or 3CLpro, generating a number of non-structural proteins (nsPs). These nsPs include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsP12) and the NTPase/helicase (nsP13), which primarily constitute the membrane-bound viral replicase complex (6,7). The viral replicase synthesizes the entire viral genome (replication) as well as eight subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) (8,9).",

Thus, a lot of efforts have been made to identify and test small molecule inhibitors of the SCV helicase as drug candidates (13\u201316). RNA and DNA aptamers against SCV helicase were also reported to have an inhibitory effect against nucleic acids unwinding (17,18). Although the tertiary structure of the SCV NTPase/Helicase has not been experimentally verified, the structure prediction of the protein was recently reported (19,20). SCV nsP13 has been shown to contain two separate domains, i.e. the helicase domain (Hel) and a metal-binding domain (MBD), which consists of several conserved Cys/His residues at the N-terminal (6,19). The SCV helicase Hel domain has been categorized into the Superfamily I helicase based on the conserved sequence motifs as shown in the Escherichia coli Rep helicase (21).",

In choosing duplex nucleic acids as substrates for unwinding, most known helicases unwind only one type of nucleic acid, either the DNA or RNA duplex. However, SCV helicase nsP13 has been shown to display activity on different types of nucleic acid substrates. The helicase nsP13 can unwind both RNA and DNA duplexes with a 5\u2032- to 3\u2032- polarity, in which the presence of 5\u2032 ss overhang is absolutely required to unwind DNA duplexes (6,7). Furthermore, it has been observed that both ss RNA and DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of the helicase to the same degree (7,25). Thus, it is highly important to understand the duplex nucleic acid unwinding mechanism of the nsP13 helicase with respect to putative controlling factor(s) in nucleic acid unwinding.",

Previously, analysis of nucleic acids unwinding by the coronavirus helicase was performed using a multiple turnover kinetics experiment, in which the helicase may rebind to the substrates after completion of a cycle of unwinding (6,7). In contrast, our experimental setup of the single-turnover condition enabled us to obtain quantitative aspects of the unwinding kinetics, especially the processivity of unwinding by the helicase. The reaction scheme is shown in Figure 1A, in which the helicase is initially allowed to bind to the substrate without ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of ATP hydrolysis, unwinding was not observed (data not shown). However, the addition of magnesium ions to the reaction allowed the helicase to unwind the DNA duplexes (Figure 1A).\n",

Therefore, to investigate the processivity of nsP13, kinetic studies of nsP13-catalyzed DNA unwinding were performed with DNA substrates containing different duplex lengths (shown in Table 1) under the single-turnover reaction condition. Measurements of the reaction amplitude of the fraction of dsDNA molecules unwound allows one to calculate the processivity of the helicase (31,32). As shown in Figure 2, the amplitude decreased as the length of the DNA duplex increased from 20 to 90 bp. This decrease in amplitude with an increase in duplex length may have occurred partly due to the reannealing of DNA strands behind the helicase and to the helicase dissociation from the DNA during unwinding. Nevertheless, the large excess of trap DNA that is included in the reaction rapidly anneals to the strand that is displaced from the duplex substrates during unwinding. A decrease in the amplitude of DNA unwound was observed in the absence of trap DNA at a given duplex DNA length (data not shown), indicating that the trap DNA prevented reannealing of displaced strands after completion of unwinding.\n",

The processivity of a helicase is defined as the probability of unwinding a base pair versus dissociation of the helicase from the DNA at that position (24). At present, it is hard to calculate the exact processivity of the nsP13 helicase due to the absence of \u2018kinetic step size\u2019 information of active nsP13 (31,35). The monomeric form of most SF1 and SF2 helicases shows that they are rapid and processive at translocating along ssDNA, but not processive in terms of dsDNA unwinding (36\u201338). This raises the possibility that nsP13 may function as an oligomer in its active form like other SF1 and SF2 helicases, despite the fact that the helicase is non-processive by itself. Considering the hexameric ring-shaped helicases such as T7 bacteriophage helicase, the formation of ring was expected to result in high processivity due to DNA passage through a central channel. However, single-turnover kinetic analysis showed that the T7 helicase by itself has a low processivity for unwinding dsDNA (\u223c15 bp), but had a 9-fold higher helicase activity (\u223c130 bp) in the presence of polymerase and thioredoxin (31,39). The fact that SARS coronavirus has a polymerase and many non-structural proteins of unknown functions led to the hypothesis that additional proteins may be involved in the helicase activity of nsP13 (40).",

More importantly, the extent of stimulation of ATPase activity with ss nucleic acids was previously shown to be proportional to the length of ssDNA or ssRNA at a given concentration (25). These observations may indicate that nsP13 binds to the ss nucleic acids with a defined binding site size.

The quantity of unwound duplex DNA increased as the length of the ss 5\u2032-tail increased. These results suggest that more ssDNA products were formed from duplex DNA substrates that could potentially bind more than one helicase molecule on the 5\u2032-tail, implying that multiple nsP13 molecules might exhibit a higher processivity. Alternatively, a tighter binding affinity of the helicase monomer or oligomers to longer ss tails might also explain this increase in DNA unwinding. Based on these two explanations, we hypothesized that the helicase may occupy the defined length of the ssDNA overhang as a minimal binding site size and the stronger affinity is caused by cooperative binding of multiple helicases on a longer ssDNA. A tail length of 20 nt enabled nsP13 to marginally unwind 50 bp duplex DNA substrates, and a tail length of 40 nt allowed nsP13 to maximally unwind more duplex DNA (>95%) that was 50 bp in length. We postulate that the functional nsP13 monomer or oligomer requires a ssDNA loading strand that is at least 20 nt to translocate and unwind duplex DNA, which is analogous to a putative binding site size.\n",

Increasing the gap size allowed nsP13 to bind to ssDNA and to unwind the bottom strand DNA annealed to the 3\u2032 side of the top strand. When gaps of 5 or 10 nt were present in the bottom strand, the nsP13 helicase unwound the substrate with a very low processivity; <10% of substrates were unwound (Figure 4B). However, more ssDNA was formed when substrates contained gaps of 15 or 20 nt in the middle of the duplex DNA (Figure 4B). This result indicates that the longer loading strand facilitated more binding of nsP13 molecules to the ssDNA gap, resulting in a higher processivity in duplex (30 bp) unwinding. An increase in the amplitude of ssDNA product formation for DNA substrates containing 5\u201320 nt gaps was observed, indicating that DNA unwinding processivity was enhanced by an increase in the ssDNA gap. Interestingly, the amplitude obtained for 30-bp duplex DNA substrates containing a 20-nt gap was not as high as when the substrate contained a 20-nt 5\u2032-tail overhang (>0.9 in Figure 2). This result suggests that the state of the nsP13 helicases bound to the 20-nt ssDNA gap were different from the one bound to the 20-nt 5\u2032-tail.",

            "text": "The results of this study clearly show that increasing the ssDNA tail length enhances the unwinding amplitude. This result was also previously observed for SF1 and SF2 helicase (26,41); longer ssDNA tails provide more chances for helicase molecules to bind to ssDNA and multiple binding leads to an enhanced unwinding efficiency. In the present experimental setup, where the enzyme concentration was greater than the substrate concentration, all ssDNA tails were assumed to be initially bound by nsP13. The stacked oligomers and forward movement of nsP13 caused by the binding of multiple nsP13s on the ssDNA tail are believed to be the main reasons for the enhanced unwinding on substrates with a longer ssDNA loading strand. Taken together, when nsP13 concentration was in excess, the amplitude of ssDNA formation increased as the length of either the ssDNA overhang or gap increased. These results suggest that multiple nsP13 molecules may bind to the ssDNA loading strand and unwind longer duplex DNA with a higher processivity.",

Gapped substrates with a 5\u2032-ssDNA tail, which contained a ssDNA gap that was 10 nt in length between the 30 bp of the lead duplex and 20 bp of the trailing duplex (20T30bp10G20bp in Table 1), was readily unwound by nsP13, resulting in displacement of the two duplexes (Figure 5A). However, for the gapped substrate that did not have the 5\u2032-ssDNA tail (0T30bp10G20bp in Table 1), nsP13 was able to unwind only the 20 bp of the trailing duplex and not the 30 bp of the leading duplex (Figure 5A). This result indicates that the two gapped DNA substrates are recognized differently by nsP13 and the 5\u2032-ssDNA loading strand is of primary importance for recognition and unwinding of the DNA duplex. Notably, a 10-nt gap was sufficient for the internal initiation site to completely unwind the 20 bp of the trailing DNA duplex, which was not observed for the unwinding of the longer 30-bp DNA duplex with a 10 nt gap (substrate \u201810 Gap\u2019 in Figure 4). This indicates that nsP13 requires the presence of a longer 5\u2032-ssDNA track to unwind a longer duplex DNA.\n",

To this end, we prepared DNA substrates with a longer trailing duplex (30 bp) and 10-nt gap (substrates in Figure 5B). As stated earlier, the 10-nt gap was not sufficient for nsP13 to completely unwind the 30-bp DNA duplex on the 3\u2032-side, which was unwound when the gapped DNA substrate without the 5\u2032-ssDNA overhang was used (0T20bp10G30bp in Figure 5B). Note that a blunt-ended DNA substrate (the lead 20-bp duplex of 0T20bp10G30bp) slightly unwound under this experimental setup. A portion of the blunt end duplex might have a 5\u2032-ssDNA at the end due to breathing of the DNA duplex, which supports unwinding of the 20-bp DNA duplex. However, this effect was not sufficient for the unwinding of the longer 30-bp DNA duplex (square symbols in Figure 5A). Most importantly, nsP13 was able to completely unwind the 30 bp of the trailing duplex in the 10-nt gapped DNA substrate containing a 5\u2032-ssDNA tail (20T20bp10G30bp in Figure 5B). This result suggests that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and facilitate unwinding of the 3\u2032-side of the DNA duplex by the helicases that are internally bound at the gap. This may be the reason why the 30-bp DNA duplex containing the 10-nt gap and 5\u2032-overhang (20T20bp10G30bp) unwound more efficiently than the gapped DNA substrate containing the longer lead DNA duplex (30 bp) with a blunt end (\u201810 Gap\u2019 shown in Figure 4). A portion of the nsP13 helicases may stack up after the 5\u2032-side of the DNA duplex is unwound and may then unwind the 3\u2032-side of the DNA duplex. Therefore, the nsP13 helicase can track through the loading strand and facilitate unwinding of the DNA duplex as long as the translocated helicases stay on the track.",

Chemical cross-linking with DMS showed that the degree of cross-linking was slightly altered in the presence of ligands; a higher order oligomers were observed in the presence of longer ssDNA (arrowheads in Figure 6). Interestingly, the nsP13 protein itself readily formed a dimer and trimer in the absence of any ligands. Thus, oligomerization of nsP13 is an intrinsic property of the protein, which is facilitated in the presence of long ssDNA and ATP. However, we could not determine the definite oligomeric state of the helicase in this study, suggesting that a dynamic oligomeric status of the helicase might exist in the presence of ss DNA.\n",

            "text": "Based on the results obtained when the length of the 5\u2032-ssDNA tail and internal ssDNA gap in duplex DNA was varied, together with the observation that nsP13 oligomerization occurs in the presence of ssDNA, we believe that nsP13 more efficiently unwinds partial-duplex nucleic acid substrates containing ss regions at the 5\u2032-side that are long enough to allow the binding of multiple monomers (Figure 7). The proposed model, schematically shown in Figure 7, is very similar to that proposed for the unwinding of DNA by the HCV NS3 helicase and T4 Dda helicase (26,41). The proposed model for DNA unwinding by those helicases does not require protein oligomerization per se to obtain greater processivity. The increase in the helicase activity was explained by functional cooperativity rather than structural contacts between helicase monomers. Although multiple nsP13 helicases do not necessarily need to form a functional oligomeric form, multiple molecules of nsP13 are more efficient at unwinding longer substrates under single-turnover conditions. As depicted in Figure 7, multiple molecules of nsP13 loaded on the leading strand are more likely to complete the unwinding process before leading helicase monomers disassociate from the substrate. This cooperative translocation is demonstrated by our results on the unwinding of the gapped duplex DNAs with or without the 5\u2032-ssDNA overhang (Figure 5). Unwinding of the 3\u2032-side of the DNA duplex with a short gap size was impeded when fewer nsP13 molecules translocated from the 5\u2032-side of the DNA, suggesting that multiple nsP13 monomers loaded on the same ssDNA track function together to produce more displaced ssDNA than a single nsP13 monomer can do. Taken together, the model presented in Figure 7 is a summary of how the non-processive nsP13 belonging to SF 1 helicase accomplishes substantial processivity in unwinding duplex nucleic acids in vitro. It should be noted that nsP13 may interact with other hosts and/or viral proteins when unwinding its RNA genome in infected cells and it may exhibit different properties during RNA unwinding.\n",
