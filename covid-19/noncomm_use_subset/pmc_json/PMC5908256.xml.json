            "text": "Previously, we used a nonhuman primate model to show that C5a is an effective target for treatment of ALI induced by viral infection (11). However, little is known about the role of aberrant complement activation in paraquat-induced ALI. Here, we established a cynomolgus macaque model of paraquat-induced ALI to better understand the role of complement and to identify therapeutic targets. After paraquat administration, the monkeys showed typical ALI characteristics, including scattered hyperemia, thickened alveolar septa, and infiltration of inflammatory cells accompanied by cellular degeneration and/or necrosis (Supplemental Fig. 2A, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D162; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). At 6 hours, after paraquat administration, the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)\u20131\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013\u03b1, IP-10, and MCP-1 were marked higher than those in control animals (Supplemental Fig. 2B, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D162; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). The concentration of C3a, C5a, and C5b-9, indicators of complement activation, was also significantly higher in paraquat-treated animals at the same time point (Supplemental Fig. 3A, Supplemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D163; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). Paraquat up-regulated expression of C3aR and C5aR in lung tissues relative to that in normal lung tissues. Deposition of C3c was greater in lung tissues from paraquat-treated animals than in those from untreated animals (Supplemental Fig. 3B, Supplemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D163; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). Taken together, these data further support aberrant activation of the complement system. One may argue that the route of administration of paraquat to macaques is different from that to the patients with paraquat poisoning as mentioned above. Because of the difficulty to control the amount of paraquat applied orally due to the severe vomit, we had to administer paraquat intraperitoneally according to the dynamic distribution and absorption of paraquat (30, 31) and obtained reproducible results which consistent with those from testing the blood samples of the patients with paraquat poisoning.",

            "text": "Complement activation products C5a play an important role in proinflammatory responses. To determine whether IFX-1 could alleviate the clinical signs of paraquat poisoning, we compared hemograms, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, BUN, CRE concentrations, and the prothrombin time (PT) in IFX-1\u2013treated (or not) cynomolgus macaques at 16 hours post paraquat administration. We found that the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils decreased significantly after paraquat administration, whereas the number of neutrophils and monocytes increased. Surprisingly, in contrast to the sham treatment group, the IFX-1 treatment group had fewer neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p < 0.05) at 16 hours post paraquat administration. Compared with the sham treatment group, the IFX-1\u2013treated group showed a sharp decrease in CRP, CRE, BUN, ALT, and AST levels, suggesting that IFX-1 reduced acute systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat. In addition, IFX-1 shortened the PT (p < 0.05), indicating that the antibody also inhibited the coagulation cascade (Supplemental Fig. 4, Supplemental Digital Content 6, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D164; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159).

IFX-1 treatment increased expression of SP-A, suggesting that it may help protect alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, the expression and transcription level of VE-cadherin, a molecule important for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity in lung microvessels (35), increased significantly at 16 hours post IFX-1 treatment (p < 0.01), further confirming that anti-C5a treatment protects lung integrity and function during paraquat-induced ALI (Supplemental Fig. 6, A and C, Supplemental Digital Content 8, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D166; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159).",

Resolution of ALI requires repair of epithelial and endothelial barriers and the removal of inflammatory cells and exudate from the distal airspaces, all of which depend on the balance between inflammatory interactions and molecular signals (36, 37). Patients with paraquat poisoning develop ALI symptoms and typically die of multiple organ failure (38). A mouse model of paraquat-induced ALI showed strong activation of the complement system, resulting in tissue damage (12). Here, we observed aberrant complement activation in patients who had ingested paraquat and in a primate model of paraquat-induced ALI.

C5a is a major anaphylatoxin and exerts strong proinflammatory effects by targeting a broad spectrum of immune and nonimmune cells, affecting the migration of macrophages and neutrophils, and inducing synthesis of other chemotactic factors (2, 24). Furthermore, C5a triggers an oxidative burst in macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils and increases TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 gene expression and protein synthesis by macrophages (39). In a previous study, we showed that IFX-1 reduced serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in African Green Monkeys infected with H7N9 virus (11). Here, we used a monkey model of paraquat-induced ALI to show that IFX-1 reduced the number of inflammatory cell infiltrating in lung, as well as levels of CRP, BUN, ALT and IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, thereby reducing injury to the lung, spleen, kidney, and intestine.",

Indeed, the pulmonary endothelium plays a key role in the development of ALI (40, 41). Once activated, endothelial cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MCP-1, which recruit neutrophils and macrophages and contribute to collateral cell damage and organ dysfunction. Zeng et al (42) demonstrated that H5N1-induced damage to pulmonary endothelial cells triggered host inflammatory responses and that C5a may participate in endothelial activation and affect expression of adhesion molecules. We found that IFX-1 increased VE-cadherin expression and alleviated lung lesions, suggesting that decreased activation of endothelial cells and an improved endothelial barrier in the lung contribute to an improved outcome. IFX-1 may also preserve lung function, as evidenced by the increased SP-A level in treated animals. SP-A is closely associated with lung structure and innate immune responses. It is unclear whether alveolar epithelial injury is primary to paraquat insult or secondary to lung endothelial injury. Nonetheless, it is evident that damage to epithelial and endothelial cells converges on a common pathway, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. As such, reduced endothelial activation and protection of lung epithelial cells may be a potential mechanism underlying C5a blockade.",
