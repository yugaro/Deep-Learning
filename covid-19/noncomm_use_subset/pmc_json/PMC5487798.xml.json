Previous studies have reported that the overall incidence of pericardial disease\nin cats ranges from 1 to 2.3% [6, 22], with congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathy being the\nmost common cause in cats [9]. Other causes of\npericardial disease in cats include neoplasia, trauma, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic\nhernia, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal\nfailure and infective pericarditis [9, 27, 29]. Infective\npericarditis has rarely been reported in cats, and the reported causes of this disease include\ndental infection, pneumonia, abscess, peritonitis, pyometra or idiopathic [14, 17, 19, 22]. In these\ncases, the long-term use of appropriate antibiotics could induce clinical remission [14, 19]. However,\nfibrinous pericarditis, which is well recognized in cattle, has a poor prognosis [4] and has rarely been reported in cats and dogs [20, 23].",

The heart\nwas encapsulated by a pale-yellow, fibrinous substance (Fig. 3). In the cross section of the heart, the epicardium was covered with an approximately\n0.5- to 1.0-cm layer of fibrin (Fig. 4). The fibrinous layer adhered to the epicardium strongly and could not be separated\neasily. In addition, there was a 1.5-cm abscess adhered to the pericardium and cranial segment\nof the left cranial lung lobe. Histopathological examination revealed severe exudation of\nfibrin with neutrophil infiltration around the epicardium. In particular, an organized\ngranulation tissue was noted between the surface of the epicardium and the fibrinous layer\n(Fig. 5). Bacterial colonies were also seen in the fibrinous layer (Fig. 6A). Special stains revealed that the bacterial colony consisted of small cocci that were\nnegatively stained with Gram\u2019s stain (Fig. 6B and\n6C).

Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed using samples\nfrom the abscess, pericardial fibrinous layer, pleural effusion and ascites.

Moraxella\nosloensis was also detected in the ascites sample. In addition,\nBrevundimonas vesicularis, a gram-negative bacillus, was detected in the\nabscess, ascites and pleural effusion samples.

Another case report described bacterial pericarditis in a cat with pyometra and\nhematogenous spread of Escherichia coli [17]. In addition, Enterobacteriaceae and\nStaphylococcus spp. infections resulted in septic pericarditis in another\ncat [26]. Furthermore, Pasteurella multocida,\nActinomyces canis, and Fusobacterium and\nBacteroides spp. were detected in the pericardial fluid of a cat with\nseptic pericarditis [19]. In the present report,\nMoraxella osloensis, Bacteroides pyogenes and\nBrevundimonas vesicularis were detected from the abscess, ascites and\npleural effusion. Moraxella osloensis is a normal commensal of the upper\nrespiratory tract in humans [8], and\nMoraxella spp. are commonly detected in the healthy feline oral cavity\n[24]. Bacteroides spp. have been\nisolated from the oral flora of cats [15], and\nBacteroides pyogenes has been detected in cat bite wounds in a human\npatient [16]. Brevundimonas\nvesicularis has been isolated from the external environment [28]. It was reported that Moraxella osloensis and\nBrevundimonas vesicularis could induce bacteremia and/or infective\nendocarditis in immunocompromised human patients [8,\n16, 28]. In\nthis study, histopathological examination revealed gram-negative, small cocci in the fibrinous\nlayer. Although Moraxella osloensis was not isolated from the bacterial\ncultures of the pericardium in the present case, Moraxella osloensis was\nsuspected as the causative agent based on the morphologic appearance and gram staining of the\nbacteria in the fibrinous pericardium. The cat reported here was not infected with FIV and\nFeLV, which are known to cause immunosuppression in cats. On the other hand, a part of the\ncat\u2019s left lung was abscessed and adhered to the pericardium, suggesting a possible\nrespiratory origin of the bacteria. Although the infection course of these pathogens is\nunidentified, it was suggested that inflammatory processes in adjacent lung parenchyma might\nproduce the abscess and cause the spread to the pericardium.",

Based on the necropsy and histopathological examination findings, we\ndiagnosed this cat with fibrinous pericarditis due to bacterial infection. Fibrinous\npericarditis, which is well recognized in cattle, has rarely been reported in dogs, horses and\npigs [1, 4, 5, 23]. In cats, only\none case of the fibrinous pericarditis caused by FIP has been reported [20]. Feline coronavirus titer of the case was medium (1:200). Therefore, we\nsuggested that antibody titers measured in the serum be interpreted cautiously, and that\nmedium titers do not have any value in diagnosing FIP [10]. In addition, many healthy cats exposed to the feline enteric coronavirus have\ntiters ranging from 1:100 to 1:400 [21]. PCR\nexamination for the detection of FIP using a pleural effusion sample was negative. Compared\nwith serological tests, PCR provides the obvious advantage of directly detecting the\ninfection, together with higher sensitivity and specificity in case of cell-free body cavity\neffusion [7, 10].\nMoreover, the histopathological findings of the pericardium in the present case were not\nidentical to the typical findings of FIP infection.",

            "text": "The appropriate therapeutic approach for infective pericarditis in cats is unclear because of\nthe low incidence and small number of published case reports. In general, therapy for\ninfective pericarditis requires pericardiocentesis for drainage of the purulent effusion and\nthe administration of antimicrobial agents [3].\nAppropriate antibiotic therapies have reportedly resulted in complete resolution of the\npericardial effusion in two cats [14, 19]. In contrast, pericardiectomy is the treatment of\nchoice for dogs and cats with evidence of infectious pericardial disease [2, 17, 25]. In human medicine, pericardiectomy is typically\nreserved for people who develop constrictive pericarditis [13]. Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization have also been used for\nthe diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis in cats [18,\n25]. In this case, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial\ncultures using pleural effusion samples were performed at the time of presentation to\nVMC-OUAVM. However, no bacteria were cultured and antibiotic selection based on susceptibility\ntesting could not be performed. Because empirically administered antibiotics could not improve\nthe clinical symptoms in the present case, broad-spectrum antibiotics should have been started\nimmediately. In this case, a large amount of ascites and pleural effusion characterized by\nmodified transudates were seen at necropsy. It was thought that fluid administration converted\nthe exudative effusion to a modified transudate. In addition, severe fibrin exudation and\nsubsequent organization resulted in constrictive pericarditis and induced decompensation and\ncongestive heart failure. It might be necessary to use cardiotonic agents for the purpose of\nimprovement of the heart failure, and pericardiectomy might be suitable in such cases.\nEffusive-constrictive pericarditis induced by coccidioidomycosis and several neoplastic\npericardial diseases have been reported in dogs [11,\n12]. However, these findings were not seen on\nhistological examination in the present case.",
