            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, and by 2013 had caused approximately 20 recorded outbreaks across East and Central Africa. These had been restricted to rural areas and confined to small clusters of villages. In each case containment was achieved within a few months and after fewer than 500 confirmed cases.1 The world assumed that EVD was too efficient at killing its hosts, doomed to quickly burn out wherever it arose. The 2014 West African outbreak has changed everything. It was the \u2018Black Swan\u20192 \u2013 the inevitable consequence we did not foresee. By mid-December 2014, there had been over 17,000 reported cases spread across nearly every region in three adjacent countries, and approximately 6,000 people are known to have died.3 It spread to the US, Mali, Senegal and Nigeria. Cases have been treated across Western Europe. Until early November 2014, there was no sign of a reduction in transmission, and case numbers were rising exponentially. This is still true of Sierra Leone where over one hundred health care workers have died, and there is no certainty the other affected countries will not again see an upsurge in new cases. Estimates of how many people could be affected have varied widely and include up to 1,400,000, or up to 25,000 cases per day by mid-January 2015.4 This has increased dramatically since the World Health Organization (WHO) projected a maximum of 20,000 cases in August 2014,5 highlighting how difficult it is to predict the future epidemic direction, though organisations such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res highlighted their concern as early as March 2014.6 Mathematical modelling is challenging and cannot easily account for conflict, mass movement of people, or breakdown of civil society, but though the very high case numbers may not be reached, one thing is certain: this will be a terrifyingly large outbreak, something never before faced on a global scale.",

Modelling now firmly places the current outbreak strain as belonging to the Zaire strain (EBOV), with entry into the West African animal population approximately in the mid-2000s from central Africa.8 One discrete contact with one infected animal is responsible for all the disease seen. Early analysis of 80 samples from Sierra Leone shows that in 1 month 400 mutations were identified. It is unclear if those mutations carry any fitness advantage, or whether this epidemic will evolve differently than those seen before. But as of December 2014, EBOV in West Africa is not behaving differently than what has previously been seen. There is no change in route of transmission, no suggestion of aerosolised spread, no gross differences in disease presentation. Therefore we know the measures required to control this outbreak: contact tracing, adequate testing and isolation, onward referral for treatment, communications with communities, improved logistics to support a fragile health system. These are the stalwarts of public health control across the last decades.",

As with much of Africa, these boundaries were European-drawn and do not correlate with different community identities or languages. Radio messages were initially in official languages only.

Peripheral health units are only equipped to diagnose and treat malaria, pregnancy and a few other key conditions, and if patients do present to hospital, in many settings there is a lack of basic equipment like gloves, aprons, running water and soap.

The present Ebola outbreak began very close to where civil war erupted in Sierra Leone in 1991, and trust in the government in this region is low. Although acceptance of Ebola is rapidly increasing, there was initially disbelief about its existence, and conspiracy theories about population control were prominent and sometimes roused by media. This constellation of palpable fear and deep mistrust inhibited early engagement and sound communication about the threat of EVD. It was understandable, therefore, that families were reluctant to hand over their relatives to treatment centre staff wearing masks and suits. This is particularly true when there was a high likelihood of never seeing their loved ones or their bodies again.",

By keeping family members at home to die, burial practices involving body preparation and touching by mourners further facilitated spread. Early in the outbreak, insufficient staff to bury bodies safely led families to bury their own dead. Given that many of these factors are present in the settings of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where previous EVD outbreaks have centred, the emergence of a disease thousands of miles from where it had been seen previously also contributed to spread. The endemnicity of Lassa Fever may have led to a false sense of security among healthcare workers regarding the transmissibility and mortality associated with viral haemhorragic fevers. Furthermore, wearing full personnel protective equipment in a humid environment comes with considerable difficulties, with differing opinions on which option is best to use. Safely incinerating waste in the rainy season brings its own challenges.",

The WHO were slow to deploy experts, not appreciating the potential seriousness from the outset. Approaches used in smaller outbreaks were followed, and institutions were slow to adapt to new models of care. There was an initial dearth of organisations willing to deploy clinical staff to the field, and many traditional health non-governmental organisations withdrew their in-country staff. Fear lead to delays as they adapted to the disease. And unlike Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), major travel routes with potential spread into the West were not affected.

Any reduction in circulating and replicating the virus may allow the body vital time to produce immunity; however this has not proved effective for Lassa Fever and needs to be evaluated formally. There are three major vaccine developments underway, entering Phase 1 and 2 trials, likely eligible for roll-out by early 2015. However, though these offer hope for the future, they are unlikely to be deterministic in shaping the control efforts of this outbreak. Earlier trial intervention was hampered by a lack of ability to conduct research given the burden of treatment needs, so evidence of treatment effect is still awaited from the field. Simple treatment interventions such as aggressive electrolyte replacement and anti-diarrhoeal agent administration remain untested.",

This needs to be agile, responsive, with clear chains of command, and able to engage early. We may have been fortunate to have avoided an outbreak of this scale before now.
