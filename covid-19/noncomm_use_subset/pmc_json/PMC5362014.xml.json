Regular testing of seemingly healthy individuals was not common until the introduction of the FeLV vaccine. FeLV prevalence in the preselected sick cat population in the 1980s was extremely high (33.3\u201356.3% in 1985\u2013198613), and the introduction of the FeLV vaccination onto the Austrian market in 1988 was expected to have a substantial impact on reports of disease prevalence. It is, however, important to bear in mind that the 1985\u20131995 study did not necessarily represent the general domestic cat population and, in this respect, the current study provides a more realistic picture of FeLV antigenaemia in the region of eastern Austria.",

However, in 1996, and 2008\u20132010, cats <1 year of age also made up the largest proportion of FeLV antigenaemic individuals.

Hofmann-Lehmann et al determined that 10% of the cats tested in their Swiss population (n = 597) were FeLV provirus positive, in spite of a negative ELISA result.21 The proportion of FeLV-antigenaemic animals older than 5 years of age remained below 10% for all periods in the current study.",

Therefore, repeat testing with ELISA or another test method is essential in every healthy cat with a positive FeLV antigen test result. The European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases suggests the use of immunofluorescence assay or provirus PCR as confirmatory tests for FeLV infection.25 For this purpose, PCR was used in the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. However, it was not feasible to assign follow-up and confirmatory tests to individual cats in this retrospective analysis, so that the percentage of false-positive test results and transiently antigenaemic cats cannot be estimated here. Additionally, such tests may have been performed in other external diagnostic laboratories. For this reason, it was impossible to tell whether cats testing negative were regressively infected, as such animals do not have free antigen circulating in their blood stream but retain provirus in their bone marrow.16 In order to estimate accurately the true prevalence of FeLV infection, random samples from the entire Austrian cat population and additional virus isolation or PCR would have been required, which were not available for this retrospective analysis of existing data. A Swiss study has reported that up to 10% of cats tested and found to be negative for FeLV antigen are provirus positive when analysed by PCR.21 Similarly, the assessment of antigenaemic animals did not include the possibility of abortive infections, where the FeLV is eliminated by the cat\u2019s immune system prior to antigenaemia occurring.",
