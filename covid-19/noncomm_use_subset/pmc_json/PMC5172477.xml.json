In less than four weeks after the global outbreak, a novel member of Coronaviridae family, namely SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified in the blood of respiratory specimens and stools of SARS patients, and confirmed as the causative agent of disease according to the Koch postulates (2). Soon afterwards, first fully sequenced genomes of viral isolates were published 3., 4.. In 2005 the number of fully sequenced viral isolates exceeds one hundred (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez).",

Since coronaviruses are known to relatively easily jump among species, it was hypothesized that the new virus might have originated from wild animals. The analysis of SARS-CoV proteins supports and suggests possible past recombination event between mammalianlike and avian-like parent viruses (6). Common sequence variants define three distinct genotypes of the SARS-CoV: one linked with animal [palm civet (Paguma larvata)] SARS-like viruses and early human phase, the other two linked with middle and late human phases, respectively 7., 8.. SARS-CoV has a deleterious mutation of 29 nucleotides relative to the palm civet virus, indicating that if there was direct transmission, it went from civet to human, because deletions occur probably more easily than insertions (5). However, more recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV is distinct from the civet virus and it has not been answered so far whether the SARS-CoV originated from civet, or civet was infected from other species 9., 10.. The genome is relatively stable, since its mutation rate has been determined to be between 1.83\u00d710\u22126 and 8.26\u00d710\u22126 nucleotide substitutions per site per day (11).",
