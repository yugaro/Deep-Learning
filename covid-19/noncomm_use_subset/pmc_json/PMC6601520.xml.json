From December 2015 to October 2016, household contacts of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV cases included in the CARBO cohort in Martinique University Hospital were recruited for a household transmission study. Laboratory confirmation of recent ZIKV infection was performed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing (RealStar Zika Virus reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction kit 1.0; Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) of serum or urine, or by direct detection of immunoglobulin M against ZIKV in serum (French National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses in Marseille, France). Immunoglobulin M antibodies were captured with rabbit antihuman immunoglobulin M antibodies (Interchim, Montlu\u00e7on, France).",

During each visit, household contacts were asked whether they were experiencing symptoms potentially associated with ZIKV infection such as fever, maculopapular rash, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and myalgia since the beginning of the ZIKV epidemic, as well as the date of onset of any symptoms. In addition, study teams performed telephone interviews to obtain an update between 6 and 12 months after symptom onset in the index case.",

In this model, each household member has a probability pC to acquire infection from outside the household during the course of the epidemic (hereafter, \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d). If an individual is infected, there is a probability pH of vector-mediated transmission toward another susceptible household member (\u201cwithin-household transmission\u201d).

In our first sensitivity analysis, we assessed how our estimates were modified if the analysis was restricted to this shorter time period (see Web Appendix 4). Second, the observed distribution of household sizes is truncated for Martinique (23), with households of size \u22656 being reported in a single category. In the baseline analysis, we assumed these households were uniformly distributed between sizes 6, 7, and 8 (see Web Table 1). We performed a second sensitivity analysis (see Web Appendix 5) using a geometric distribution (see Web Table 2). Finally, our model assumes that households were followed until the end of the epidemic. In practice however, follow-up was often a bit shorter: Defining the follow-up as the proportion of Zika-like cases reported in Martinique (14) at the time of the last interview, 84% of households were followed for more than 90% of the epidemic, and 16% were followed up for 80% to 90% of the epidemic. In a third sensitivity analysis, we accounted for this censoring in the model (see Web Appendix 6).",

A number of factors could explain such variations. The risk of developing symptoms following infection might vary by population, for example, because of genetic factors. Age and sex might also affect the probability of asymptomatic infection (37), and thus the study population can explain some discrepancies. The variations could also be partly explained by differences in case definitions. For example, in Yap Island a symptomatic case was defined by an acute onset of generalized macular or papular rash, arthritis or arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis (4), which is slightly different from the definition used in the present study. Other factors could also explain these discrepancies (e.g., the study designs or the way data were collected). These factors might have a larger effect for pathogens like ZIKV, whose symptoms are mostly mild. With an overall attack rate of ZIKV infection of 50% (95% CrI: 43, 58), this study suggests that about a third of the population in Martinique experienced symptoms due to ZIKV infection.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the reporting of Zika-like symptoms by household members was done retrospectively, sometimes several months after the household inclusion. Thus, recall bias is likely in this study, particularly given the mild symptoms associated with Zika disease. This might have led to overestimating the proportion of asymptomatic infections. However, our estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic infections is at the lower end of those found in the literature, and it seems unlikely this proportion could be much below 40%. The imperfect follow-up of households also means that reported dates of symptom onset in household contacts are likely to be too imprecise to be used for inference (20, 32). As a consequence, we developed a statistical framework that did not use this information but relied only on the total number of cases per household. Second, it is possible that symptoms reported when Zika circulation was low were more likely related to another cause than were those reported around the peak of the outbreak. Such disparities between households included at different times during the epidemic could have an impact on estimates. However, we have shown in a sensitivity analysis that results remained stable when the analysis was restricted to the households recruited between February and October 2016. Finally, for a mild disease like Zika, with nonspecific symptoms, the definition of a symptomatic case can have an impact on the estimated proportion of asymptomatic infections.",

We also estimated that 78% (95% CrI: 54, 95) of infections were acquired from the community, which can limit the impact of within-household prevention measures.
