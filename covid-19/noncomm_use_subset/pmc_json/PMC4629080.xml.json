Influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity in the last and in this century1. To date, influenza-specific drugs include M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir), both of which were approved to prevent and treat influenza2. However, rapid emergence of drug-resistant mutants restricts their utilization3, 4, and therefore leads to an urgent need to develop novel antivirals.",

            "text": "The use of high-throughput screening (HTS) technology for antiviral discovery is a fairly recent endeavor. Utilizing virus-inducible reporter genes to quantitate the infectivity has been achieved for several viruses5, 6. A reporter system mimicking the process of transcription/replication of influenza virus was constructed by Lutz et al.7. Cells were transfected with a reporter system that expressed Firefly luciferase in a response proportional to the infectivity of influenza virus. This luciferase assay is more rapid and simple than the standard plaque assays. Afterward de Vries et al.8 adapted this system by substituting Gaussia luciferase. Gaussia luciferase (hereafter referred to as Gluc), discovered from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, can give high levels of light emission centered at 470 nm by catalyzing the oxidation of the substrate coelenterazine to coelenteramide9. This reaction requires no cofactors but O2, and it generates over 100-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity when compared with other frequently used luciferase reactions (e.g., Renilla or Firefly luciferase)10, 11. With the help of a secretory signal, Gluc was secreted into the culture medium. Lysis of the cells was not necessary, and the measurement of luciferase activity was simple and time-saving, making Gluc assays a promising technique. Nevertheless, transient transfection of the Gluc reporter system is likely to introduce variation between the experiments.",

Results demonstrated the ability of this assay to identify influenza inhibitors. Several parameters (Z\u2032 factor, CV, S/B, S/N) utilized to evaluate the quality of HTS (high-throughput screening) assays also validated our approach.

As shown in Fig. 2, the infection with influenza A viruses induced much higher luciferase activity than did the two strains of influenza B virus. The observation that the 293T-Gluc cell line is more responsive to influenza A virus may reflect species specificity of UTR region for the corresponding RdRp, which is consistent with a previous observation7.

When infected with virus at MOIs of 0.001 or lower, cells failed to generate a detectable Gluc signal. It should be noted that viral infection at an MOI of 1 induced significant CPE in 293T-Gluc cells like MDCK, while the cells kept a normal morphology during the 96 h time period of post-infection when the MOI was less than 0.1 (data not shown). This may explain the observation that the Gluc signal from the cells infected at an MOI of 1 was less than that of MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 3), most likely due to reduced cell viability. Based on this result, the amount of virus used and the measurement time point were set at an MOI of 0.05 and 24 h post-infection, respectively.",

            "text": "To ascertain assay sensitivity, three reference compounds, including ribavirin, amantadine hydrochloride and nucleozin, were examined in our assay. Ribavirin is used against several DNA and RNA viruses including influenza viruses15, 16. It is converted to ribavirin monophosphate, which disturbs GTP synthesis, leading to inhibition of RNA synthesis in cells17. Amantadine hydrochloride, approved for the treatment of influenza infections, acts in the early phase of the life cycle of influenza A virus to target the M2 ion channel18, 19. Nucleozin is a novel inhibitor with anti-influenza activity. It impedes influenza A virus replication by triggering the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation20. We used the Gluc reporter assay to evaluate these antivirals in dose-response experiments, measuring IC50 (Fig. 4). All the compounds showed the ability to reduce the luciferase signal driven by influenza A/WSN/33 virus. IC50 values determined from our experiments were comparable to data previously reported (Table 1), demonstrating the applicability of the Gluc reporter assay for screening influenza inhibitors. Furthermore, compared with the conventional plaque reduction assay (PRA)24, the method herein is more rapid and simple for the determination of IC50 values. At least 48 h were needed before the number of plaques could be calculated, whereas our assay can give results in 24 h after infection. Moreover, this unbiased and automated method of infectivity quantitation avoids tedious plaque counting, making it an ideal approach.",

To ensure that the assay can be used in high-throughput screening, we assessed its accuracy by using several statistical parameters25 (Table 2). Z\u2032 factor is a simple statistical characteristic for HTS assay. It can be used to evaluate the performance of an assay. A robust assay should have a Z\u2032 factor>0.5 and the larger the value of Z\u2032 factor, the better the data quality of the assay26. The Z\u2032 factor in our experiments was 0.84 (n=48), which is considered to be excellent for use in HTS (Fig. 5). Normally, infected cells treated with a positive anti-influenza compound are used as positive control for calculating the Z\u2032 factor. Nevertheless, according to the assay validation guidance for agonist assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/), the background signal is also suitable for use as a \u2018minimum signal\u2019. Since viral infection acts as an agonist of luminescent protein, we used mock-infected cells as positive control in the validation analysis. Similarly, other work used mock-infected cells as positive control to calculate the Z\u2032 factor27. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4, most of the anti-influenza compounds tested were able to achieve full inhibition in our assay. Moreover, the minimum signals derived from infected cells treated with one of the positive anti-influenza compounds were close to that of mock-infected cells.",
