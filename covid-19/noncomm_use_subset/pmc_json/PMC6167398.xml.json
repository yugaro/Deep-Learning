Various infectious disease outbreaks have recently occurred around the world, including severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002,3 pandemic influenza worldwide in 2009,1 Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014,4 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Korea in 2015.5 It was reported that 31 patients contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome from exposure in the emergency department at a university hospital in Taiwan.3 A single patient admitted to an emergency department in Korea caused the Korean outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015.5 These reports suggest that emergency departments can be key locations for the spread of emerging infectious diseases. However, in the abovementioned cases, the appropriateness of preparation, triage, and treatment in the emergency departments have not been reviewed. Few clinical guidelines for infection control in emergency departments have been established,6 and not all institutions have their own manuals. In addition, current situations and issues related to infection control in emergency departments have not been examined or recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM)\u2010certified hospitals have infection control manuals for the emergency department, and to investigate manual contents, consulting systems, and isolation facilities. The results could contribute to establishing essential lists for preparing infection control manuals for emergency departments.",

A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board\u2010certified acute care physicians in Japan (JAAM\u2010certified hospitals) received a written request between March and May 2015 to provide written evaluation of infection control in the emergency department. The questionnaire (Table S1) covered the following: (i) demographics of the hospitals, (ii) contents of infection control manuals for emergency departments, (iii) consulting systems between emergency departments and infection control departments, (iv) negative\u2010pressure isolation rooms in emergency departments.
