AEII cells are targeted by various pathogens that cause life-threatening pneumonia, several of which have a zoonotic origin [3]. This includes influenza A virus (IAV), whose natural reservoir is birds but which has undergone human adaptation causing serious pandemics [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Comparative studies using available cell types to study IAV zoonosis, such as human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and the chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line DF-1, are likely to confound species-, tissue-, and cell line-specific effects. Therefore, establishing human and avian primary cell models would enable more physiologically relevant comparison.",

However, the regeneration of adult lung epithelium is only activated upon injury, impeding the identification of the cell types involved. Most of the evidence appoints differentiated alveolar epithelial cells as the progenitor cells of the alveolar epithelium, although other reports suggest that specialized stem cells are recruited upon severe alveolar damage [15]. The potential to differentiate alveolar linages from human distal airway stem cells (DASCs) was addressed previously [16]. Human DASCs were found to express P63 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5), which are markers for progenitor cells of the stratified epithelium, and were able give rise to podoplanin+ AEI cells and CC10+ airway club cells, but not surfactant protein C+ AEII cells [16]. Bove and colleagues grew human AEII cells in culture with feeder cells and the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 for >30 population doublings [17]. However, markers of AEII cells were downregulated after the first passage and the phenotype of the cells after feeder removal was not extensively characterized.",

The same mechanism has been suggested to orchestrate regeneration after tissue damage and it is likely to underlie the robust growth of lung epithelial cells in feeder co-culture [18]. Additionally, the overlapping marker profile of human distal airway epithelial cells (DAECs) with that of regenerating murine epithelial cells challenged with influenza virus supports this hypothesis [17, 20, 21]. As epithelial cell proliferation is usually followed by coordinated differentiation, we hypothesized that it may be possible to induce differentiation towards alveolar epithelial cells by using factors that induce terminal differentiation of lung progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells [22].",

We successfully adapted this method to chicken DAECs and compared the growth kinetics of different IAV strains between the two species.

We also increased the concentration of DBZ during induction to suppress persistent Notch signaling, which causes differentiation toward airway club cells in mice. After three days of induction, cells were passaged and feeders removed to allow differentiation (Fig. 4A). This resulted in reduction of SCGB1A1 (Suppl. Fig. 2A), the goblet cell marker MUC5B, and the ciliated cell marker FOXJ1 (Suppl. Fig. 2B), and upregulation of AQP5 after 72 h (Suppl. Fig. 2C). To exclude epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), we measured the expression of the epithelial marker CDH-1, the mesenchymal marker \u03b1-SMA, and the EMT regulatory factor Slug, after feeder removal with and without induction medium (Suppl. Fig. 2D). No substantial reduction of CDH-1 or increase of \u03b1-SMA or Slug were recorded, suggesting the epithelial phenotype is maintained.",

High Notch signalling activity has been linked to differentiation of progenitor cells towards airway club cells and inhibition of differentiation into alveolar cells [21, 33, 34]. While upon feeder removal, DAECs differentiated towards airway club cells, as shown by increased expression of SCGB1A1 and downregulation of AQP5 over time, no changes in genes regulated by canonical Notch signalling were recorded by our microarray experiment. Instead, we found rather robust inflammatory and proliferation pathway signatures confined to STAT3 and NF-\u03baB signalling [35]. This might reflect involvement of non-canonical Notch activity, since non-canonical Notch signalling regulated by NF-\u03baB or IL-6 expression has been reported previously for different tissues [36, 37].",

Although these factors have frequently been considered as main markers of mature alveolar cells [21, 38, 39], surfactant proteins are also expressed in immature cells, thus definitive confirmation that the cells are fully mature would require electron microscopy to confirm the presence of multilamellar bodies. It is interesting that our observations, including the molecular markers expressed in the proliferating DAECs and the induction method with Notch pathway inhibition, are consistent with the repair mechanism described for mouse lung epithelium (Fig. 8) [16, 21]. The morphological and phenotypical shift from type II toward type I-like cells after 48 h of feeder removal also closely resembles that of freshly isolated alveolar epithelial cells.",

The localization of these molecular markers in vivo strongly suggests that they are epithelial cells of the parabronchi, the site of gas exchange in birds [52, 53]. In contrast to human DAECs, chicken DAECs required the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase inhibitor RepSox, not the Notch inhibitor DBZ to maintain proliferation, which closely resembles the signalling pathways activated in mammalian airway epithelial cells in vitro [[54], [55], [56]]. In addition, SFTPA and AQP5 were expressed regardless of induction treatment and remained relatively stable after feeder removal. While different cell types corresponding to the mammalian type I and II alveolar epithelial cells have been reported in chicken, the relationship between them remains unknown.",

            "text": "Chickens have been appointed as potential intermediate hosts for the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans [57, 58]. Establishing models for avian and human primary DAECs enables direct comparison of influenza A virus replication in different relevant host cells, and ultimately allows deeper studies of the underlying biology. Various mutations that improve the replication efficiency of avian IAVs in mammalian hosts have been identified [59, 60]. Of these, the most extensively studied mutation is the single point mutation at influenza polymerase basic 2 (PB2) 627 residue from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K). This has been linked to greater replication rates of avian viruses in human cells. Accordingly, the avian-like 627E-expressing virus A/Mallard/Germany/439/2004(H3N2) replicated better in chicken than in human DAECs. Although A/England/195/2009(H1N1pdm) also harbours 627E, compensatory mutations that allow for efficient replication in human cells have been identified [61]. Nonetheless, chicken DAECs still replicated A/England/195/2009(H1N1pdm) more productively than human DAECs. One possible explanation is that these viruses were generated in eggs and they might have acquired mutations that enable higher replication rates in chicken cells. For the other strains tested, these harbour the mammalian-like 627 K mutation in PB2 and still replicated equally well or better in chicken DAECs, suggesting that in addition to E627K PB2, other viral factors might affect host range [[62], [63], [64]]. Human-adapted viruses, such as H1N1pdm or H3N2, were found unable to infect poultry in previous studies. This discrepancy might be due to the absence of additional cell types that are required to mount an efficient immune response against some strains of influenza A virus in our ex vivo model. Along these lines, establishment of lung organoid cultures will benefit further investigations. Interestingly, the innate immune response of chickens against viruses is weak [65]. Chicken cells lack the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) receptor, which can sense IAV, resulting in the induction of type-I interferon (IFN) responses. In contrast, strong RIG-I expression is observed in ducks, potentially explaining duck resistance to most influenza virus strains [66]. In vitro replication kinetics of IAVs in DAECs of aquatic birds, the natural reservoir of influenza virus, could help understand the tropism of influenza virus. However, the establishment of such models will depend on the availability of lungs from these species and the development of molecular tools to allow further characterization.",

Expression levels were normalized to GAPDH. (B) Human DAECs transfected with siRNA against NP or Allstars were subjected to replication assay with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus at indicated MOIs. Quantification reflects the percentage of cells infected after 72 h p.i. (C) Representative images.

Treating the cells with high doses of the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ) and other factors during the expansion phase induces commitment to an alveolar epithelial cell phenotype. (B) Lineage-negative epithelial progenitors (LNEPs) and distal airway stem cells (DASCs) are the specialized tissue stem cells that proliferate upon tissue damage in mice (e.g. influenza infection) [16, 20, 21]. Vaughan et al. proposed that murine LNEPs require Notch signalling to activate the \u0394Np63 and CK5 program, and conversely Notch blockade promotes generation of alveolar epithelial cells [21].
