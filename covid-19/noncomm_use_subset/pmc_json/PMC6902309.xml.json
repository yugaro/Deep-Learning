Two of the largest hospitals in Singapore report that on average, one in seven hospitalized patients acquire a nosocomial infection,1 with immunocompromised children at greatest risk. Little is known regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses in clinical environments. Theoretically, influenza and other respiratory viruses are transmitted through contact with contagious persons and contaminated fomites. However, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the concept of transmission through the inhalation of virus-laden particles. Specifically, airborne virus-laden particles \u22644\u03bcm are thought to play a significant role in respiratory virus transmission as they can remain in the air for prolonged periods of time and are inhaled deep into the lungs.2",

Aerosol samples were collected once per week for seven weeks in May and June 2017. The NIOSH samplers were stationed on tripods and placed along the corridor outside the open patient bedding area, and one SKC filter cassette was attached to a mobile computer on wheels (COW) used by doctors and nurses during ward rounds. Each sampler was connected to an AirChekR TOUCH Sample Pump (SKC, Eighty- Four, USA) with Tygon tubing (61 cm length, 0.635 cm diameter) for air collection at a rate of 3.5 L/min. A total of 840 L of air was collected during each four-hour sampling period. Each NIOSH sampler separates collected particles into three aerodynamic diameters: >4\u03bcm, 1-4\u03bcm, and <1\u03bcm.3 Filter cassettes and sample tubes from the NIOSH samplers were stored at -80\u02daC before processing. Prior to nucleic acid extraction, sample material collected in the 1-4 \u03bcm and <1\u03bcm size fractions were combined (described below).",

This result is inconsistent with our previous study which successfully recovered adenovirus DNA from aerosol samples collected using the SKC filter cassettes in patient waiting rooms.11 Sampling sessions in our current study collected 840 L of air using one SKC filter cassette compared to the collection of 900 L of air per each of two SKC filter cassettes in our previous study. Additionally, SKC filter cassettes were mobilized in our current study and stationary in our previous study. The higher sample volumes collected in our previous study as well as the difference in mobility and location of the samplers might explain the difference in positive sample collections among studies.",

Additionally, future studies might involve more comprehensive demographic and clinical risk factor analyses to help us better understand phenomenon such as super-spreading.
