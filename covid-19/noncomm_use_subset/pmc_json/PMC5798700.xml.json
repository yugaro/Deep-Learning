            "text": "In the last 30 years, China experienced high economic growth accompanied by a transition to a more market-oriented economy. The health system of China is also converting from a centrally planned health system to one that is more market oriented.1 These transitions have resulted in an expanded supply of high-quality hospital services, especially to the people in large cities. Unfortunately, the majority of people in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties accessing good-quality and affordable health care.2 Health inequality has become a major issue in the health system of China, which raises concerns among the general public and the government.3 In China, health inequality at the individual level is reflected in health disparities between rural and urban areas and variation among provinces. The health disparity between urban and rural areas has been decreasing, but still exists.4 Geographic health variation is also dramatic, but less studied. In 2005, Shanghai, the most affluent city in China, enjoyed 78 years\u2019 life expectancy at birth, which was the highest in China. However, the life expectancy at birth in the poorest province in Western China was only 65 years.5 The extent of diffusion of the advantages of growth throughout the economy has not been rigorously studied. Our hypothesis is that over the 30 years\u2019 economic growth, geographic variation in health system resources and performance at the provincial level has decreased and is achieving convergence. The alternative hypothesis is that over the 30 years\u2019 economic growth, health resources and performance at the provincial level have increased, resulting in divergence.",

Small area variation studies have been widely used, especially with comparisons of health care expenditures (HCEs) in different regions; for example, the Dartmouth Atlas points out variations of expenditures as possible explanations of high health costs. The Dartmouth researchers have also presented simulations that suggest that the cost savings would be huge if high-cost regions could, somehow, reduce their costs to those of low-cost regions.6 Convergence analysis is another method to study geographic variation. Convergence analysis does not focus on the difference between specific areas, but looks at the time trend of variation reduction in HCEs, or other health indicators. Triggered by the seminal articles by Barro and Sala-i-Martin and Mankiw et al, a huge amount of convergence literature emerged in various contexts, mainly to study patterns of economic growth across different regional economies.7-9 Health economists have also adopted convergence analysis to measure health variation within and between regions. The convergence of HCEs has been studied in the European Union and the United States.10-14",

When all economies are assumed to converge toward the same steady state regardless of their specific features, beta convergence is said to be absolute. When the steady state may depend on features specific to each economy, beta convergence is then said to be conditional.

Average beds per thousand people in Eastern China, Central China, and Western China were all below 2.5 in the early 1980s. From then on, the number of beds in Eastern China increased steadily in the 1980s and stayed almost stable in the late 1990s. However, in Central China and Western China, bed supply increased slightly in the 1980s and early 1990s. But from the late 1990s to 2003, beds per thousand people in Central China and Western China decreased. After 2003, all 3 regions experienced a sharp increase in average number of beds.

In China, health care is mainly financed by government investment, public health insurances, and out-of-pocket fees. The majority of government investments are from local government, rather than central government. The scale of resource input largely depends on local economic conditions.20 Public health insurance funds are also localized. However, provinces in China have had unequal economic development since 1980s, resulting in an uneven local financial capacity to pay for health services. For the indicator of beds/1000, the trends of sigma divergence in 1980s and 1990s could probably be explained by the imbalanced economic development among provinces. However, the obvious sigma convergence after 2000 probably represented the input from central government. The 2000 World Health Organization report on health system performance and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis pushed the central government to allocate resources toward public health services and health equity issues. Since then, the central government has expanded resource input dramatically to less developed areas in Central China and Western China to build and expand primary hospitals and public health facilities.21 Such enormous investment from central government and local government might contribute to the sigma convergence of structure indicators as well as beta convergence in procedure and outcome indicators in recent years. For instance, China\u2019s New Cooperative Medical Scheme, a large government subsidized health insurance plan, has improved finances of township health centers since the start of its pilot program in 2003.22 Moreover, in 2009, the Chinese government implemented an ambitious health reform that is aimed to build up basic health services system for all.23 The success of these re-distributive measures on physicians per capita seems be more ambiguous than measured focused on beds.",

And last but not least, the data availability has limited our ability to evaluate the convergence in process and outcome measures.

However, these people usually only seek specialty care in tertiary hospitals, and thus should have little impact on the overall health indicators. Second, data for most process and outcome indicators are only available for less than 10 years, so it is difficult to determine the trend of sigma convergence during the relatively short period of time. In addition, we are aware that most health indicators in this article reflect the quantity of health resources and health service utilization, rather than the quality of care.

Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators. Thus, over the 30 years of economic growth, not all health indicators have achieved convergence, and when sigma convergence did occur in structure indicators, it is still uncertain whether real equity has been achieved.
