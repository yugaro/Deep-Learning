Microglia have traditionally been considered to be in a resting and quiescent state in physiological conditions. With the advent of elegant two/multiple photon microscopy image techniques, genetic and molecular targeting tools, we now appreciate that in normal conditions microglia have a ramified morphology, are maintained by diverse signals from neurons and can continuously move their dendrites, which allows for constant active screening of the surrounding microenvironment (Kierdorf & Prinz, 2017; Nimmerjahn, Kirchhoff, & Helmchen, 2005).",

By genetically labeling microglia in pathogen\u2010free mice it was recently determined that microglia can survive during the whole lifespan of an animal, and can thus exert crucial long\u2010lasting influences on neurodegenerative disorders (Fuger et al., 2017). However, it is well documented that microglia can be self\u2010regulated without contribution from peripheral myeloid cells and their turnover is tightly controlled by the coupling of apoptosis, with approximately 1% murine microglia dying in 1 day and the whole population of cells renewing several times throughout life (Askew et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2017). Although significant species differences in microglial biology such as microglial density were noted, this finding also concords with observations in humans, a recent study highlighting that more than 96% of human microglia can be slowly renewed throughout life (Reu et al., 2017).",

In the healthy brain microglia efficiently monitor CNS homeostasis and have a marked impact on neural development. In order to actively survey the CNS they have recently been demonstrated to require the proper activity of tandem\u2010pore domain halothane\u2010inhibited K+ channel 1, which is the main K+ channel expressed in microglial cells (Madry et al., 2017). In several pathological conditions such as epilepsy, single\u2010cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal microglia indicated that microglia undergo dramatically transcriptomic alterations (more than 2,000 differentially expressed genes) and immunological activation during early time points, particularly regarding mitochondrial activity and metabolic pathways (Bosco et al., 2018). As such they play an indispensable role in the inflammatory cascade. Some studies based on comprehensive single cell RNA sequencing experiments have reported that microglia do not vary considerably in the whole brain (Keren\u2010Shaul et al., 2017; Matcovitch\u2010Natan et al., 2016). However, a recent study provides further novel evidence that CD11b+ microglia in the circumventricular regions are actually maintained in the activated state even during physiological conditions (Takagi, Furube, Nakano, Morita, & Miyata, 2017). Microglia in this specific region not only display the amoeboid morphology rather than the ramified form, but also express high protein levels of activation markers in the healthy mouse brain (Takagi et al., 2017).",

Indeed, genome\u2010wide transcriptional studies have reported that the bio\u2010energetic and immunoregulatory functions of microglia varied considerably in different anatomical regions, evidenced by cerebellar and cortical microglia displaying distinct gene expression profiles under steady\u2010state conditions (Grabert et al., 2016). More specifically, a recent study provides convincing evidence of an epigenetic mechanism involved in the clearance activity of microglia that differs regionally in the adult brain (Ayata et al., 2018). Variations in microglial profiles may also depend on the specific diseases states (Mastroeni et al., 2017), significantly altered transcripts having been reported in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively (Mastroeni et al., 2017).",

The concept of glial replacement therapy using progenitors has recently been proposed (Cartier, Lewis, Zhang, & Rossi, 2014; Shen, Li, Bao, & Wang, 2017; Srivastava, Bulte, Walczak, & Janowski, 2017).

Indeed, a growing body of evidence convincingly demonstrates that microglia are recognized for acting as \u201cbusy bees\u201d and maintain an expanding array of functions during both early brain development and adult homeostasis (Figure 1). In particular, microglia can secrete a broad range of protective neurotrophic substances such as brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor, neuronal growth factor (NGF), insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101 (IGF\u20101), platelet\u2010derived growth factors and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) (Butovsky et al., 2014; Parkhurst et al., 2013; Shibata & Suzuki, 2017; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017), thus ensuring appropriate neuronal network development and maintenance as well as enhancing memory and learning (Molteni & Rossetti, 2017; Parkhurst et al., 2013). There is a widespread consensus that microglia are also in active intimate contact with neighboring neuronal and non\u2010neuronal cells, thereby regulating neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation and refining the neural circuits (Frost & Schafer, 2016; Mosser et al., 2017).",

Among these complex systems the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and CD200\u2010CD200R axes play key roles in microglia\u2013neuron contact (Eyo & Wu, 2013; Kierdorf & Prinz, 2017; Limatola & Ransohoff, 2014; Mecca, Giambanco, Donato, & Arcuri, 2018). Indeed, the CX3CR1\u2212/\u2212 mouse exhibited profound alterations in both morphology and connectivity of the mature newborn hippocampal granule neurons (Bolos et al., 2017). The CD200\u2212/\u2212 mouse exhibits an activated microglial phenotype accompanied by high expression of CD11b and CD45 (Hoek et al., 2000). Concurrently, microglia are critically involved in neural repair through phagocytic scavenging, such as clearing dead tissues, ingesting plaques, and apoptotic cells (Michell\u2010Robinson et al., 2015).",

In addition to the complement\u2010mediated mechanism, astrocyte\u2010derived interleukin (IL)\u201033 is also physiologically required to maintain synapse homeostasis by modulating microglial synapse engulfment (Vainchtein et al., 2018). Microglia are involved in regulating and shaping both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, such as \u03b3\u2010aminobutyric acid\u2010expressing and glycinergic synapses (Cantaut\u2010Belarif et al., 2017; Um, 2017). Conversely, early evidence obtained from CX3CR1 gene\u2010deleted mice indicated that reduced numbers of microglial cells during brain development could impair the processes of synaptic pruning, resulting in a significantly higher density of dendritic spines and immature synapses (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Shibata & Suzuki, 2017). During adult neurogenesis, microglia actively contribute to regulate the dynamics, maintenance, and functions of synapses of adult\u2010born neurons (Reshef et al., 2017).",

Following pathological alterations, extracellular adenosine triphosphate, a source of energy metabolism, produced by dead and injured neurons can in turn activate microglia via purinergic receptors (Liu & Wang, 2017). Excessive activation of microglia can induce mitochondrial damage and decrease mitochondrial oxygen consumption depending on the degree of their activity, thus influencing total brain energy metabolism and exacerbating disease states (Ghosh, Castillo, Frias, & Swanson, 2017). Activated microglia can also be viewed as a major source of reactive oxidative stress through the release of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which cause oxidative damage to neurons and exacerbate the inflammatory cascade.",

In vivo, microglia may even have a functional interaction with peripherally derived immune cells in the circulation in healthy subjects (Kanegawa et al., 2016). A recent exciting study has reported that activation of microglia plays a central role in inducing neurotoxic reactive astrocytes through production of IL\u20101\u03b1, TNF, and C1q. The reactive astrocytes induced by activated microglia, termed A1, lose their homeostatic functions and consequently contribute to the death of neurons and differentiated oligodendrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017). In addition, activated microglia have been shown to inhibit anti\u2010inflammatory TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling by downregulating TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010regulated gene expression and this prolongs chronic microglial dysfunction, partly through the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway (Affram, Mitchell, & Symes, 2017). In this way microglial cells may prevent a return to normal homeostatic function. Conversely, if chronic inflammation mediated by persistent dysfunction of microglia remains after injury, this could lead to further extensive tissue damage, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits (Donat et al., 2017). In summary, although microglia are essential for the development and normal function of the CNS, dysregulated microglia contribute to disease severity in various neurological pathologies.",

The former contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury through secretion of pro\u2010inflammatory and neurotoxic mediators, whereas the latter exert crucial influences on tissue repair through production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines (Tang & Le, 2016). We have argued that it is functional states and not in vitro induced surface marker expression phenotypes that should be used to describe activated myeloid cells (Mills, Harris, & Ley, 2015), and the classification of M1 and M2 functionally polarized states for microglia is now considered less valid (Ransohoff, 2016). Despite this conceptual development, at least nine subgroups of macrophage activation states based on transcriptome\u2010based network analysis have been proposed (Xue et al., 2014). It has been mostly ignored that novel subpopulations of macrophages such as CD169+ macrophages and T cell receptor positive (TCR+) macrophages may play different roles during specific conditions (Chavez\u2010Galan, Olleros, Vesin, & Garcia, 2015).",

Even though such disease\u2010associated microglia express microglial markers, such as CD11b, IBA1, and TREM2, this specific subset of cells has been suggested to be strikingly different from normal microglia since they exhibit signs of oxidative stress and transpire to be phagocytically hyperactive with highly ramified processes during pathological states. Such disease\u2010associated microglia can also cause abnormal interactions with synapses and lead to cognitive decline and learning deficits (Bisht, Sharma, Lacoste, & Tremblay, 2016; Bisht, Sharma, Lecours, et al., 2016). Interestingly, another unique neonatal white matter\u2010associated CD11c+ microglial subset has been described that specifically contributes to myelination and neurogenesis during postnatal brain development by producing neuroprotective IGF1. Although these repopulating CD11c+ microglia were evident following genetic adult microglial depletion using CX3CR1CreER iDTR mice, the newly repopulated CD11c+ microglia did not exhibit a neurogenic gene expression profile characteristic of the neonatal CD11c+ microglial subset (Bennett & Barres, 2017; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017).

TREM2 is a receptor for the activation of disease\u2010associated microglia and the TREM2 signaling pathway has been considered as a common microglial activation pathway in several neurodegenerative conditions and aging (Deczkowska et al., 2018; Krasemann et al., 2017).

However, recent discoveries using unbiased weighted co\u2010expression network analysis have shed light on another distinct pro\u2010inflammatory subpopulation of disease\u2010associated microglia in the context of AD (Rangaraju et al., 2018).",

As described above, reactive microglia can lead to tissue damage, exacerbate deleterious effects and potentially contribute to neurodegeneration (Leyns & Holtzman, 2017). As it follows that microglia play a central role in many neurological disorders (Salter & Stevens, 2017; Wendeln et al., 2018), then microglia\u2010directed therapy, including specific microglia depletion strategies, can be regarded as a promising immunotherapy for neurological diseases (Du et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2017; Rice et al., 2015). In order to specifically deplete microglia in an injured CNS, many approaches including pharmacological inhibition (e.g. targeting the CSF\u2010R1 receptor with PLX5562) and genetic targeting have been developed (Waisman, Ginhoux, Greter, & Bruttger, 2015), and we have previously reviewed the outcomes of these approaches (Han, Harris, & Zhang, 2017; Lund, Pieber, & Harris, 2017).",

In one of our previous studies, we have indicated that cranial irradiation can cause transient accumulation of microglial cells followed by persistent inflammation and pronounced expression of IL\u20101\u03b2 and CCL2 in the hippocampus (Han et al., 2016). Indeed, neuroinflammation induced by activated resident microglia as well as infiltrating monocytes plays a pivotal role in hippocampal\u2010dependent severe cognitive dysfunction after both acute and long\u2010term irradiation (Feng et al., 2016) and microglial depletion can ameliorate these cranial radiation\u2010induced cognitive deficits (Acharya et al., 2016). Confirmed in another study, PLX5662\u2010mediated depletion can lead to protection from loss of dendritic spines, reduction of CD11b+Ly6G\u2212Ly6Chi monocytes in the blood, inhibition of monocyte accumulation and ultimately prevention of radiation\u2010induced cognitive abnormalities (Feng et al., 2016). Furthermore, PLX5562 treatment can also alleviate two different forms of Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease by reducing neuropathic features, axonal damage and promoting hindlimb grip strength (Klein et al., 2015; Scherer, 2015). One more study showed that microglial depletion by PLX5562 treatment prevented the symptom of catatonia in structural myelin protein Cnp\u2212/\u2212 mouse by reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Janova et al., 2017).",

One recent study has indicated that microglial depletion in the CX3CR1CreER DTR transgenic mouse can lead to enlargement of A\u03b2 plaques and may cause extensive neurite damage (Zhao, Hu, Tsai, Li, & Gan, 2017). However, early long\u2010term pharmacologically microglial depletion could finally inhibit plaque deposition and amyloid formation in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD, together with a relatively low level of soluble fibrillar oligomers in the brain (Sosna et al., 2018). Furthermore, the administration of GW2580 (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) orally can regulate inflammation of both the CNS and peripheral nervous systems in the ALS animal model, attenuating motoneuronal cell death, slowing disease progression and extending life expectancy (Martinez\u2010Muriana et al., 2016). However, this has not been confirmed in other studies using different approaches to deplete microglia (Gowing et al., 2008; Spiller et al., 2018). A beneficial outcome of microglial depletion is also evident in neuropathic pain by reducing the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (Lee, Shi, Fan, West, & Zhang, 2018), which was also confirmed in another study (Wang, Mao, Wu, & Wang, 2018).",

It is also of importance to note the differences of microglia activation in different types of disease processes. The findings mentioned above have to be interpreted with caution until we are sufficiently knowledgeable. On the basis of the above results, some critical issues need further investigation. For example, microglial elimination has been shown to exacerbate brain neurotoxicity in the contexts of brain ischemia, PD and coronavirus encephalitis (Jin et al., 2017; Szalay et al., 2016; Wheeler, Sariol, Meyerholz, & Perlman, 2018; Yang et al., 2018). Most microglial depletion studies have been performed using CSF\u20101R inhibitors several weeks before inducing the animal disease models. However, it is more reasonable from a clinical perspective to deplete the activated microglial cells after disease onset. Furthermore, current research findings employing CSF\u20101R kinase inhibitors (including PLX3397, PLX5562, GW2580, and BLZ945) might target multiple cell populations other than microglia (e.g. meningeal, perivascular and choroid plexus macrophages and microglial progenitor cells) (Yang et al., 2018). Cautious interpretation of pure microglial depletion effects using systemic delivery of current available CSF\u20101R inhibitors is thus warranted. Indeed, recent studies have reported that CSF\u20101R inhibition can deplete IBA+ macrophages in the kidney (Chalmers et al., 2017). In addition, CSF\u20101R inhibition can robustly decline the actions of nerve\u2010associated macrophages in the periphery (Klein et al., 2015). However, several studies have identified some potential markers that are exclusively expressed in microglia including Tmem119, P2RY12, Siglec\u2010H and Sal1, permitting distinction of resident microglia from other myeloid cells (Bennett et al., 2016; Butovsky et al., 2014; Buttgereit et al., 2016; Konishi et al., 2017). These markers, together with the Cre/loxP technology, may make it possible to deplete microglia with exquisite precision in the near future.",

Under non\u2010sterile conditions the depletion of microglia might induce at least a transient immunodeficiency that could be harmful both with respect to CNS infection and also in disrupting normal CNS homeostatic functionality in unaffected brain areas. Indeed, the removal of immunomodulatory microglia producing and responding to TGF\u2010\u03b2 could be expected to be a traumatic event in itself. The selective replacement of dysfunctional or aberrantly activated microglia in affected areas would thus be the most efficient approach. Most studies have indicated that no obvious behavioral consequences in adult mice following microglial depletion, despite extensive neuronal loss in the brain (Dagher et al., 2015; Elmore, Lee, West, & Green, 2015; Elmore et al., 2014; Rice et al., 2017). Microglial depletion in the adult wide\u2010type C57BL/6 mouse does not influence BDNF expression, the response of astrocytes and leukocyte infiltration in the experimental setting of PD (Yang et al., 2018). By contrast, neonatal microglial depletion during early life using pharmacological strategies can have a persistent impact on related motivated behavioral domains during adulthood (Nelson & Lenz, 2017). Furthermore, new tools to specifically deplete microglia by utilizing genetic approaches are in great demand. In a recent study, we have indicated that microglia can be efficiently depleted through the administration of tamoxifen in both CX3CR1CreER DTA and CX3CR1CreER DTR transgenic mice (Figure 2a) (Lund et al., 2018). This system thus allows for depletion of microglia at different disease stages by controlling the timing of tamoxifen provision.",

Additionally, embryonically seeded microglia and the newly repopulated cells may respond differently to environmental stimuli, as evidenced by two distinct cell types showing differential motilities in response to laser burn injury in vivo (Cronk et al., 2018). Using RNA sequencing it was determined that the gene profiles of fully repopulated microglia had been little influenced by administration of PLX5622 because no inflammatory related genes were up\u2010regulated or down\u2010regulated during depletion and repopulation processes (Huang, Xu, Xiong, Qin, et al., 2018).

An interesting aspect of myeloid cell repopulation with peripheral monocytes is that transcriptomic analyses reveal different outcomes in different tissues (Guilliams & Scott, 2017). Monocytes can thus replace Kupffer cells in the liver (Scott et al., 2016) and alveolar macrophages in the lung (van de Laar et al., 2016) with almost identical cellular phenotypes, while in the CNS bone marrow monocyte\u2010derived microglia only become microglia\u2010like cells, retaining more than 2,000 differentially expressed genes compared to resident microglia (Cronk et al., 2018). It is currently unknown why the CNS should differ in this respect to other tissues, but indicates that environmental cues must be tissue\u2010specific and of varied instructional consequence in different tissues (Bennett et al., 2018). It is also apparent that the repopulation process is tightly regulated, cells only occupying available tissue niches and the repopulation process (through either surviving microglia proliferation or monocyte infiltration) being halted through as yet undetermined mechanisms once the tissue is full. In certain studies an \u201covershoot\u201d of repopulating cell numbers appears to be adjusted through selective loss of cells so that a homeostatic numerical occupancy is achieved. The important concept herein is that myeloid cell niches can be both efficiently depleted of resident cells and that repopulating cells can occupy the available niche with partial or total restoration of normal homeostatic functionality.",

If the dysfunction extends to all myeloid cells (e.g. TREM2 in Nasu\u2010Hakola disease, ALS, and X\u2010linked adrenoleukodystrophy) then even repopulation by infiltrating monocytes will also not be beneficial.

Another well\u2010characterized method has been used to differentiate human and murine hiPSCs into microglia\u2010like cells through a hematopoietic progenitor\u2010like intermediate stage by adding defined factors and then co\u2010culturing with astrocytes (Pandya et al., 2017). A recently developed protocol for the derivation of microglia\u2010like cells from human monocytes could be the adoptive cell of most practical and functional relevance (Sellgren et al., 2017).",
