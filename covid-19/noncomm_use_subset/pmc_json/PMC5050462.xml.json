Filovirus PCR testing was conducted at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and on 23 July the index case was reported as filovirus positive. Samples were then shared with Redeemer's University (RUN) for EBOV-specific PCR testing, which was confirmed on 25 July 2014.

Each patient was counseled on the need for \u22654 L of oral rehydration solution daily. Treatment was started with antibiotics because of their immunosuppression and antimalarials because of the endemicity of malaria in Nigeria. Patients were also placed on a regimen of nutritional supplements and vitamins. The only analgesic administered was paracetamol. Injectables and invasive procedures were avoided unless patients were too ill or weak to take oral rehydration solution.",

Inactivated samples were stored in a \u221220\u00b0C freezer. AVL buffer and TRIzol LS reagent have been used extensively in virus inactivation including for EBOV [2\u20137]. Samples inactivated in AVL buffer were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction protocol (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples inactivated in TRIzol reagent were extracted using chloroform modified with an AVL buffer inactivation and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction protocol. Following this modified protocol, 140 \u00b5L of chloroform was added to 1 mL of a TRIzol-inactivated sample. After vortex and centrifugation, 200 \u00b5L of the aqueous phase was transferred to a tube with 700 \u00b5L of AVL buffer without carrier RNA added. The sample was then processed according to the manufacturer's protocol for extraction, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. Extracted RNA samples were divided into aliquots for sequencing at both RUN and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Samples destined for the Broad Institute were shipped on dry ice and subsequently stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

This capability is obviously useful when contact tracing is absent or incomplete, as is usually the case with epidemics. In the 2014 Nigeria outbreak, sequencing alone makes it clear that the entire outbreak stemmed from a single introduction of EBOV into the country. It also places the Nigerian outbreak in its larger context, identifying a particular branch of the Liberian LB5 lineage of EBOV as the source and showing that the Nigerian lineage did not spread into other countries.",

The resolution of genomic data is limited because new variants arise less often than new cases, meaning that many cases will be genetically indistinguishable. This can be seen in our data in Figure 2A, in which multiple successive links in the chain share identical genomes. In addition, when mutations do occur, >1 can arise in a single patient, making genetic distance an imperfect guide to the number of transmission links that have occurred. Thus, most of the cases infected directly by the index patient in Nigeria had identical genomes, but 1 case (case 4) differed by 4 mutations, even though it too resulted from a single transmission. Contact tracing (Figure 2B)\u2014when it is available\u2014does not suffer from such limitations.",

First, detection of iSNVs requires deep sequencing of good-quality samples, and that is not always possible: deep enough sequencing could be achieved for only two-thirds of our sequenced samples. Second, even when iSNV data are available, it may not all be meaningful. Some of the iSNVs we observed have previously been documented in unrelated data sets from Sierra Leone and Liberia [2, 13, 18]; these included all 8 of the shared iSNVs. Most of our iSNVs, including most shared iSNVs, were low-frequency frameshift insertions or deletions. Because they can disrupt protein structure, they are unlikely to be transmitted. More likely, these recurrent iSNVs represent either recurring mutations in highly mutable regions of the EBOV genome or sequencing errors, especially because many of them occur in homopolymer regions. In either case, their value for determining transmission chains is uncertain. More research is necessary to fully make use of within-host genomic data in understanding transmission, including better sequencing coverage for all samples and improved methods to identify false-positives.",

Based on sample dates and contact data, both of these patients were infected by the index patient, so presumably they inherited these variants from that patient. We do not, however, find them in the sample from the index patients, either as consensus SNPs or as iSNVs, despite high sequencing depth. Nor do they appear as consensus SNPs in the other cases derived from the index case, or as iSNVs in the one other case that was deeply sequenced and was sampled around the same time as samples 6 and 9. The explanation may simply be that the variants were present in the index patient but at too low a frequency for us to detect. It is also possible that their frequency changed in the index patient between the time he was sampled and transmission to the other cases, or that they differed across tissues within the patient. Better understanding of the dynamics of within-host evolution and transmission, and of our power to detect iSNVs, would help clarify this issue.",

Many samples did not produce whole-genome assemblies because of poor sample quality, and a third of those that did could not be used to detect iSNVs. This highlights the importance of rapid sequencing in clinical settings during outbreaks, with well-established sample collection and processing protocols. Although at the time of the outbreak sequencing was not yet ready on site, sequencing capability is now becoming increasingly available throughout many regions. With high-throughput deep sequencing now being routinely performed by ACEGID at RUN, high-resolution pathogen information can now be generated to elucidate outbreak dynamics and response, both in Nigeria and throughout West Africa.",
