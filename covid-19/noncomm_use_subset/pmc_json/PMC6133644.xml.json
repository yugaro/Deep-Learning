Its annual incidence is estimated to be 15 cases/100,000 per year in children compared with 1.3 cases/100,000 per year in adults. Skin symptoms occur mainly in the lower extremities or hips, but they can also involve the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. In acute cases, severe abdominal pain, arthralgia, or proteinuria may develop.[3\u20135] Complications such as intussusception, perforation, and renal failure may also occur, and an accurate diagnosis is needed at the onset of the disease.[6] Therefore, it is important to determine the timing of an HSP epidemic and identify its causative agents.",

In South Korea, HSP is a relatively common disease, but reports on the overall developmental patterns in children and adolescents in recent years are lacking, and only studies that investigate its epidemiology in individual hospitals are available.[14] Direct comparison between the prevalence of HSP and the incidence of respiratory and enteric infections in South Korea have not been reported.",

Therefore, the study included all patients <18 years of age who were diagnosed with HSP from January 2013 to December 2016 in South Korea.

Usually, a virus that causes an infectious disease is detected a few days after the disease has developed. Therefore, when comparing the time of positive detection of the virus and the time of HSP diagnosis, it is important to use weekly and monthly data. In the correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the P value was <0.05 and the correlation coefficient was >0.5.

Although various causes have been reported, it is known to occur mainly after respiratory infections such as those caused by streptococci, staphylococci, and mycoplasma.[2,17] There are reports of preceding gastrointestinal tract infections caused by Helicobacter pylori or Campylobacter.[5,18,19] Nevertheless, the etiology of HSP often remains unknown. Almost 70% of the cases of HSP in children reported in Spain occurred in fall and winter.[20] This higher incidence in the coldest months further supported an infectious trigger in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, in this population study, upper respiratory infections were described as the potential precipitating event in more than 30% of the cases. By contrast, in the same region of NW Spain, adults in whom HSP occurred in summer were more susceptible to develop permanent renal involvement.[21] However, studies on viral infections as the leading cause of HSP have limitations. HSP was reported in the 2009 influenza virus pandemic, and there have been reports that HSP incidences followed influenza vaccinations.[22\u201324] However, most of these studies are case studies or cross-sectional studies from several institutions, and no large-scale studies have been conducted using the database of an entire country's healthcare system. In addition, different types of viral infections prevail in different regions, and their timings could vary. For this reason, our findings are important and meaningful because this is the first study to investigate the relationship between HSP and the preceding infectious diseases using the national health data from the HIRA and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases. First, through our investigation, we were able to identify the epidemiology of HSP and compare it with previous reports. Though HSP was known to affect boys predominantly, in our study, it was found to occur more in girls in South Korea.[2,6,25] Previous studies have reported that HSP is commonly seen in winter or from late autumn to early spring, and we have confirmed a similar pattern.[2,6,26] We found that it predominantly occurred in spring and specifically in March, and less in the summer particularly in August, although the number of cases reported in August was never <5.7% of that reported for the whole year.",

Due to the number of patients in this group, it is expected that the overall outbreak of HSP among patients in August was more, though a clear cause for this increase in incidence could not be determined. However, our finding with bocavirus, which appeared to be most active during relatively warm weather, is clearly interesting. Although not investigated in this study, additional studies are needed to determine the association with enteroviruses that occur in summer. Comparison of the virus epidemics based on the age groups of the patients also produced interesting results. Depending on the age group, there were various types of viruses that were temporally associated with HSP. RSV showed a similar temporal pattern in the early childhood group but was not confirmed in all patients and other age groups. While norovirus was associated with HSP in early childhood and middle childhood group, rotavirus that rarely occurred in early adolescence also showed an association with HSP. Even if it occurs after a viral infection, it is difficult to confirm that a single virus is a causative agent. Nevertheless, our study is significant because it suggests the possibility of a causative disease by confirming the coincidence of HSP and some viruses that were not previously linked to HSP such as rotavirus, norovirus, or bocavirus. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. Because existing predisposing factors are often not directly evidenced by causal relationships, but rather through anecdotal cases, the results of this study about relationship to seasonal variation may raise the possibility of a novel pathogen associated with HSP.",

            "text": "However, our study has some limitations. First, we compared the timings when a particular virus was positively identified and the incidence of HSP. The results were confirmed using statistical methods by experts specializing in preventive medicine and statistics. But it was not possible to confirm whether the virus caused HSP. It is known that IgA-containing immune complexes triggered by infectious diseases are deposited on organs such as skin, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract and can cause HSP, and we can only assume that the viruses suspected of causing HSP have similar mechanisms.[2,27,28] However, studies on whether only specific viruses or bacteria cause HSP should be continued. Second, there is a limitation in the extent of virus detection. While the data included HSP outbreaks for all patients <18 years of age in South Korea, virus detection tests were given to only patients with severe respiratory symptoms. Therefore, the patients who were not tested but have symptoms were not included in the study. Also, if the causative virus itself is not as severe as rhinovirus, its detection rate would have been much lower than actual incidence. On the contrary, if there was, for example, an influenza virus epidemic which caused severe symptoms, and relatively more tests were conducted, its actual detection rate would have been higher than that of other viruses. Finally, there is a limitation in the HIRA data. The possibility of duplicate diagnoses could not be totally excluded, even though only the initial diagnosis was included by examining the cases by the unique number given to each individual. Also, for the same reason, patients who visited clinics for recurrence and not for a simple follow-up, would not be identified. Because the patients evaluated were based on the HIRA data, information regarding their clinical aspects was not included in this study. It is necessary to investigate whether the clinical features differ based on the infectious agent causing HSP, and information about the prognosis should also be evaluated. In addition, the diagnosis of HSP was based on the final diagnosis only, not grounded on all patients or chart review, so there may be some errors in the total number of patients. Nevertheless, our study will be the first to investigate an association between the occurrence of HSP and outbreaks of different viruses using the National health data.",
