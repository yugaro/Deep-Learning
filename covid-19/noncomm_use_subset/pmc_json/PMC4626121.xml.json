            "text": "Cadmium is a hazardous environmental pollutant with economic value, however no known biological function. It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1,2). It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3). A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3,4). The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5,6). Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7,8). Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15\u201330 years (9\u201311), which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation.",

Inhalation is one of the predominant causes of cadmium exposure in humans and it has been reported to cause chronic inflammation and is responsible for various lung diseases (16\u201319). Cytokines are the predominant mediators of inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, which regulates the expression levels of other cytokines and chemokines (20\u201322). Conversely, cells respond to various toxic insults by secreting different anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, for defense and repair mechanisms (23).",

Industrial waste fumes, burning of fossil fuels and cigarette smoke are the predominant direct sources of cadmium exposure to humans. It is estimated that 90% of the inhaled cadmium particles are absorbed by lung tissue and cause pulmonary damage, emphysema and lung cancer (16\u201319). Organisms respond to xeno-biotics via inflammation and it is initiated through various signaling molecules, including cytokines, in the cells. To date, few investigations into the expression levels of the cytokines, IL-1\u03b1 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory), have been reported (27). Therefore, elucidating the expression levels of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-10, and the cell viability at various CdCl2 concentrations and incubation durations in human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 lung cancer cells may provide an understanding of how lung cells response to cadmium toxicity.",

Furthermore, other previous studies have revealed that cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation, to activate the cytokine network and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (30,31). The higher expression of cytokines, which lead to inflammation, may be responsible for the later cytotoxic effects in the cells, which lead to a decrease in viability, as observed in the present study (Fig. 1).

Higher concentrations of cadmium induced higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which degrade macromolecules, including proteins and DNA (12,13,36). The low expression levels of the IL-1\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines in each cell line may also be linked to the toxic effect of unbound cadmium in the cells, as a result of the lack of metallothionein protein. This result is consistent with a previous study, which reported inhibition of the expression of IL-1\u03b1 in rat hepatocytes following treatment with high concentrations of CdCl2 (32). In addition, longer exposure durations may also be a factor in causing higher toxicity, as decreased expression of cytokines were observed with increased incubation durations in the present study (Figs. 2 and 3). The longer exposure duration led to the accumulation of cadmium inside of the cell, which in turn causes decreased cytokine levels leading to cell death.",

Furthermore, the cells demonstrated a differential expression of the cytokines in response to CdCl2. The maximum cytokine levels were observed in the normal MRC-9 lung cells at an early incubation time (6 h) compared with the lung cancer cells (12 h), demonstrating an early immune response of normal lung cells. The present study clearly demonstrated the effect of CdCl2 on the expression levels of cytokines in lung cells and suggested that compounds, which activate the cytokines and reduce inflammation, may prevent cadmium toxicity.",
