            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by \u03b2-coronavirus of the C lineage (MERS-CoV), ranges in severity from asymptomatic to a severe respiratory illness with rapid progression to respiratory failure [1]. Since the identification of the first case in Saudi Arabia, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 1,638 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 587 fatal cases, in 26 countries as of February 26th, 2016. These confirmed cases have been directly or indirectly linked to countries in the Arabian Peninsula [2]. Although the exact mode of transmission remains unknown, primary MERS-CoV infections are presumably associated with community zoonotic exposure and may be passed to family members via limited secondary transmission [3]. Human-to-human spread of MERS-CoV is assumed to occur through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person [45]. As infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others in hospitals, the importance of vigilant surveillance and appropriate infection control measures must be emphasised to prevent transmission in healthcare settings.",

In that time interval, another multi-facility outbreak in an endemic area has occurred since the first healthcare facility-related outbreak was reported by Assiri, et al [9]. Here, we describe the clinical findings of 186 MERS patients in the Republic of Korea from May through September 2015. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest report of an outbreak outside of the Middle East. In this study of the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, the reported data suggest that MERS-CoV is most likely to be transmitted as a healthcare-associated infection. No community-associated infections lacking any history of contact with MERS-CoV were found in this outbreak. Even though the overall transmissibility of MERS-CoV was relatively low, there were several so-called 'super-spreading' events posing a serious threat to public health. Rapid transmission and high attack rates in dialysis units were noted, in a previous report, in Saudi Arabia [5]. However, no additional cases in dialysis units were reported in this Korean outbreak, even though many patients undergoing hemodialysis were exposed to MERS in dialysis units. This apparent heterogeneity in transmission, with many infected patients not transmitting disease at all and several patients transmitting disease to others, may be characteristic of MERS-CoV infections, similar to SARS [451011].",

            "text": "The clinical features of patients with MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were generally similar to those reported in Saudi Arabia [4510]. Asymptomatic patients were rare in this outbreak, presumably because confirmatory MERS-CoV tests were performed only for symptomatic patients, although active surveillance of asymptomatic HCWs involved in patient care was conducted at one hospital. In a previous outbreak in Jeddah, 25.1% of laboratory-confirmed cases were reported to have been asymptomatic; however, a telephone survey revealed that about 80% of those who were reached by telephone had experienced at least one symptom [4]. The proportions of patients with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes (18.8%), chronic lung disease (10.2%), or chronic kidney disease (4.8%) were smaller in this study, which might explain why cases with complicating respiratory or renal failure were relatively uncommon in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea, compared to those reported in Saudi Arabia. The incidence of pneumonia (80.8%) in this outbreak is similar to that reported in Saudi Arabia, although the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation was smaller (24.2% in the Republic of Korea vs. 56-78% in Saudi Arabia) [59]. In addition to the reduced presence of comorbidities, many patients in this study were diagnosed relatively early because rRT-PCR tests for MERS-CoV were actively performed for those with an epidemiological linkage as soon as fever or respiratory symptoms occurred. This early diagnosis might have led to early treatment initiation and thus prevented disease progression to a severe status.",

This low case fatality rate could be attributed to the application of aggressive treatment measures, including antiviral agents, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Antiviral treatments were administered to 74.5% of the patients, although clinical decisions for their use were made by attending physicians. During the MERS-CoV epidemic in the Republic of Korea, the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and the Korean Society for Chemotherapy collaborated to generate and distribute recommendations for the use of antiviral treatments based on existing available data from experiences with SARS and MERS [1213]. We were not able to assess the clinical impact of antiviral therapy on outcomes, as most patients with severe pneumonia received combination antiviral therapy along with comprehensive supportive care. The therapeutic efficacy of combination antiviral therapy should be evaluated in further studies.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, clinical data were retrospectively collected through electronic medical records and chart review, although cases were enrolled prospectively by means of active surveillance of outbreaks. The present study was observational, and thus unknown risk factors and bias might have been unequally distributed between the two groups in the survival analysis. The possibility of limitations that preclude accurate comparisons should be kept in mind given the observational nature of this study. Clinical judgments regarding management of patients were made by attending physicians, not by researchers. Second, we have presented 4 months of clinical data after control of the outbreak, and thus the data might represent acute complications of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Only 36.2% of patients showed resolution of abnormal findings on chest radiologic evaluation, and there are concerns regarding chronic complications such as pulmonary fibrosis. Further follow-up prospective cohort studies are warranted in the future. Third, although this study was performed with a nationwide database, a relatively small number of patients with mechanical ventilation were included, with limited statistical power. The impact of ECMO and convalescent serum therapy on survival may not be fully adjusted for in the survival analysis. Finally, this study was conducted mainly at large referral centers in Korea, and our findings may not be generalizable to other institutions outside of Korea.",

Although clinical features did not differ significantly from those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East, the overall mortality rate was 20.4%, which was lower than that reported in other countries. The early detection of cases with MERS-CoV infection and active management of patients during this outbreak may have improved patient outcomes. Our data suggest that MERS-CoV infections pose an important public health threat in regions outside the Middle East, and that more information on the emergence and dissemination of this virus is necessary in order to prevent its further spread.",
