Although proposed to mediate immunoregulatory and tumor surveillance functions, their primary role, like that of the rest of the immune system, is most likely to combat infectious agents. To do so, they may need the capacity to selectively recognize and attack infected host cells or else to nonselectively respond to stimuli and mediate effector function by the nonspecific release of cytokines. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NK cell recognition of target cells has been developed after the identification of a series of families of NK cell receptor (NKR) molecules that can deliver either negative or positive signals to NK cells on encounter with a target 2\n3\n4. Many of these receptor molecules recognize MHC class I antigens, but the possibility remains that some might also recognize other cell surface structures.",

The Ly49 gene family maps near the positive-triggering molecule NKR-P1 (defined by mAb NK1.1) in the area of chromosome 6, known as the NK cell complex 5\n6. Of note is that genetic resistance and susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) maps within this region at a locus designated Cmv-1\n7. The evidence implicating NK cells in the control of MCMV infection is stronger than for any other infectious agent. Suckling mice are very sensitive to MCMV infection, but a level of resistance develops at about the third week of age, correlating not only with the development of NK cell activity but also with the expression of Ly49 molecules on a high frequency of NK cells 8\n9. Reconstitution of suckling mice with NK cells in adult splenocytes or with IL-2\u2013activated, cultured lymphokine-activated NK cells confers resistance to infection 10\n11. Depletion of NK cells with anti-NK cell Abs in normal, athymic nude, or severe combined immunodeficiency mice results in substantially elevated titers of MCMV early in infection 12\n13\n14\n15\n16. Mice with genetic deficiencies in NK cell function are very sensitive to MCMV 17. Together these experiments indicate that classically defined CD3\u2212 NK cells, as opposed to NK/T cells, provide innate immunity to MCMV.",

In the liver, MCMV is controlled by IFN-\u03b3, possibly acting through a nitric oxide synthase intermediate 18\n19. The chemokine MIP-1\u03b1 attracts NK cells into the liver 20. MCMV induces relatively high levels of IL-12, which serves to induce secretion of IFN-\u03b3 from the highly activated NK cells 18. In the spleen, the NK cell\u2013mediated control of MCMV is less dependent on IFN-\u03b3 and more dependent on perforin 19. The presumption is that a cytotoxic mechanism regulates MCMV in the spleen, but it is not known why these organs differ mechanistically in their control of MCMV. Of note is that the Cmv-1 locus appears to regulate MCMV synthesis more in the spleen than in the liver, suggesting that it might relate to a cytotoxic mechanism 7.",

No NK cell subset has ever been shown to selectively regulate the synthesis of a virus or any other pathogen in vivo. Analyses of cells expressing different Ly49 molecules have been complicated by the fact that each NK cell expresses several different types of Ly49 molecules and that some of the Abs directed against one molecule cross-react with other molecules. To date, Ly49 molecules defined by four different commercially available Abs have been examined in the MCMV system: Ly49A, D, G2, and C and I, which is a pair detected by the same mAb (5E6; reference 21). No selective role for either subset could be shown in the control of infection 22. Mice depleted of NK subsets in vivo with mAb to Ly49 A, D, C/I, or G2, or with combinations of two or three anti-Ly49 mAbs tended to be just as resistant to MCMV as untreated mice. Adoptive transfers of any of these subsets into suckling mice protected them against MCMV 22. This indicated that neither of these Ly49 molecules defined a subset of NK cells required for resistance to MCMV.",

F334 rats were inoculated intrasplenically with 100 mg of a KLH-bound Ly49C amino acid sequence (CRPSNETLEYIKREQDRWDSKTKTVLD) that differed from Ly49I by a few amino acids. 1 mo later equal volumes of CFA and 100 mg of the peptide KLH were injected subcutaneously, followed by three additional injections at biweekly intervals. Spleen cells were removed and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells to make mAbs. mAb specificity was screened on Bw5147 cells transfected with Ly49C or Ly49I or on RNK-16 cells transfected with Ly49H. All of the Ly49-specific mAb generated cross-reacted with Ly49 C, I, and H, but mAb 1F8 was the most potent and was useful for depletions in vivo. mAb 1F8 does not recognize Ly49 A, D, or G2. Limitations of this mAb are its cross-reactivity with Ly49 C and I, but it can be used to measure Ly49H by using it in concert with mAb 5E6, which reacts with Ly49 C and I, but not H.

Here spleen, peritoneal cavity, and liver NK cells, defined as NK1.1+CD3\u2212, were quantified, and their total numbers and percentages within lymphocyte-gated populations were enumerated, as shown in the vertical bars in Fig. 1. Each virus infection initially caused a slight transient decrease in NK cell number and percent in the spleen, but each virus induced a substantial increase in NK cell number and percent in the peritoneal cavity, which was the site of viral inoculation. This increase in NK cells in the peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) with all of these viruses had been reported by us in the 1980s, when large granular lymphocyte morphology and Ab to asialo GM1 was used to define NK cells 29\n30. NK 1.1 is a more specific NK cell marker, particularly when used on lymphocyte-gated cells that fail to stain with anti-CD3. It is now known that there are significant populations of \u201cNK/T\u201d cells that costain with anti-NK1.1 and anti-CD3, and it is important to make those distinctions. In addition, we have found that VV induces a strong \u03b3\u03b4 T cell response and that \u223c1/3 of those \u03b3\u03b4 T cells stain with anti-NK1.1 31. Each virus also stimulated an increase in the total number and percentage of NK cells in the liver, a result also previously noted by us using less definitive techniques 28. These increases in NK cell numbers and percentages are very reproducible findings, though the degree and kinetics of the responses vary somewhat with virus dose.

These experiments showed a great deal of animal-to-animal variability, but some conclusions could be drawn. The first conclusion is that only a low percentage of resident NK cells in the liver before infection expressed these Ly49 antigens, with the exception of Ly49 C/I, which was lower but in the range of spleen and PEC percentages. A much higher frequency of the infiltrating NK cell population in the liver after virus infection expressed other Ly49 markers, in particular Ly49 D and G2, at frequencies more in line with other compartments. A second major conclusion is that within a mouse the relative frequencies of NK cells coexpressing Ly49 molecules change in relation to each other in different organs and at different times after infection. This indicates that these NK cell subsets are responding to signals induced by the viral infections differently, though it is less clear how different one virus was from the other at inducing these changes in NK cell distribution. In this experiment it appeared that all four viruses induced drops in Ly49C percentages in the spleen and rises in the PECs. Ly49G2 percentages rose in every organ with every infection. These observations were previously noted by us in more extensive analyses with MCMV 22. A consistent result seen by us in three experiments was that the ratio of Ly49G2+ to Ly49C/I+ liver NK cells at 3 d after infection was high (often >2:1) after infection with MCMV, LCMV, or MHV, but the frequencies of Ly49G2+ and Ly49C/I+ liver NK cells were about equal after VV infection (Fig. 1, and data not shown). These subtle differences suggest some selectivity in the NK cell responses to different viruses.",

In contrast, NK cells from C57BL/6 mice had sizable proportions of both 1F8+5E6+ and 1F8+5E6\u2212 populations. Thus, the expression of Ly49H (defined as 1F8+5E6\u2212) on NK cells appeared to correlate with the resistance of mice to MCMV.",

For these assays to be optimal, the cells were quickly harvested and incubated without being put on ice. Usually this intracellular IFN assay is done with lymphocytes receiving an in vitro stimulus with immunogenic peptides (for T cells) or with nonspecific stimulators, such as PMA and ionomycin 24\n33; this may mean that something in this cellular milieu continued to stimulate the NK cells. Because of the unusual nature of this assay, several controls, in addition to the isotype controls for the anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3 mAb used in every assay, were run to ensure that synthesis of IFN-\u03b3 was being observed. Using splenocytes from day 2 MCMV-infected mice as a source of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells, threefold molar excess of unlabeled anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb reduced the frequency of anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3\u2013staining NK cells from 23 to 7.6%, and the mean fluorescent intensity of the remaining and very weakly staining positive cells was reduced from 638 to 120. This mAb did not block the ability of (nonNK cell) splenocytes to synthesize intracellular TNF-\u03b1 (positive control = 0.8%; anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3 mAb-blocked = 0.7%). Similarly, incubation of the anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3 mAb with 0.8 \u03bcg/ml IFN-\u03b3 during the IFN-\u03b3 assay reduced the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 staining from 20 to 7.5, and reduced the mean fluorescent intensity of the remaining positive cells from 736 to 473, without reducing the staining against TNF-\u03b1. We conclude that this assay is indeed detecting IFN-\u03b3 synthesis and that it is revealing a high frequency of NK cells that produce IFN-\u03b3 when kept in the milieu of leukocytes from virus-infected mice. We examined IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing NK cells over the first 3 d of MCMV infection and found a sharp peak of production at 2 d after infection, in agreement with other publications using different types of techniques 18.",

A second experiment (Table , Exp. 2) with LCMV, MHV, and VV similarly showed a preponderance in IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness within the cell populations defined by mAb 1F8; the peritoneal cell data from this experiment are depicted in Fig. 6, which shows a predominant skewing of the IFN-\u03b3 response to 1F8+ cells, particularly for the LCMV and VV infections.

The fact that in vivo administration of mAb 1F8 eliminates cells staining with mAb 5E6 indicates that the loss of 1F8 reactive cells is due to their deletion and not to a masking of the 1F8 epitope with unlabeled mAb, because mAb 1F8 does not interfere with staining with mAb 5E6. Further, the enrichment in the Ly49G2 subset is another indicator that the 1F8+ subset is lost and not just obscured by mAb.

Five experiments, one with T cell KO mice, are shown in Table , illustrating this important point. Experiment 1 shows the titers in the same mice portrayed in Fig. 7. Here treatment with mAb 1F8 resulted in >100-fold increases in MCMV titers in the spleen and eightfold increases in the liver. Treatment with mAb 5E6 did not significantly elevate spleen titers, confirming our previous report 22. In fact, we previously showed that treatment of mice with mAb 5E6 in combination with mAb to Ly49D or Ly49G2 also did not enhance MCMV titers in comparison to mice treated only with the HBSS vehicle (these experiments also serve as good Ab injection controls; reference 22). In experiment 2, treatment with mAb 1F8 is compared with mAb to NK 1.1, which depletes virtually all NK cells. MCMV titers were slightly but not substantially higher in anti-NK1.1 treated\u2013 versus mAb 1F8-treated mice. In experiment 4, mice were inoculated with only 50 \u03bcg of mAb 1F8, which still manifested a profound effect, and in experiment 5 T cell KO mice were inoculated with 25 \u03bcg of mAb and developed 100-fold increases in spleen titers. In all, a total of seven experiments showed elevated MCMV titers in mAb 1F8-treated mice.",

In the aforementioned experiments, where we examined NK1.1+CD3\u2212 NK cell populations, we also routinely monitored the NK1.1+CD3+ NK/T populations. During MCMV infection, the proportions of these NK/T cell populations dropped dramatically in the liver, where they were relatively high before infection (Fig. 9, bottom). Similar drops in percents and total cell numbers of liver NK/T cells were seen with MHV and VV, though less so with LCMV (Fig. 9, top). Thus, while prototypical NK cell numbers were rising dramatically in infection (Fig. 1), NK/T cells were declining dramatically. Few NK/T cells were found in the peritoneal cavity either before or after infection. Although some of this apparent decline could be an artifact due to downmodulation of NK1.1 and CD3, our data, and those of others (R. Brutkiewitz, University of Indiana, personal communication), to be published elsewhere, indicate that this NK/T cell population undergoes apoptosis and declines in number at early stages of infection and under conditions of strong IFN-inducing stimuli.",

Monitoring Ly49 expression on these populations was sometimes difficult during infection because of high background staining with isotype-control Abs, perhaps due to the fact that many of these cells were undergoing apoptosis. Nevertheless, it was clear that a substantial proportion of the NK/T cells reacted with mAb 5E6 (Ly49 C/I) and mAb 1F8 (Ly49 C/I/H), but very few NK/T cells displayed the Ly49H phenotype of 1F8+5E6\u2212.

Displayed in Fig. 10 are data for NK1.1+CD3\u2212 NK cells from uninfected spleens, where there is very little contamination from NK/T cells, and data for NK1.1+CD3+ NK/T cells from uninfected liver, where the highest numbers of NK/T cells are found, making them easier to unambiguously discriminate from prototypical NK cells. This shows that few if any of the NK/T cells have a characteristic Ly49H phenotype and are likely not to express this positively signaling ligand. In general we have noted that some T cells, even those not expressing NK1.1, occasionally stain with Abs to the negatively signaling Ly49 molecules (Ly49 A, C/I, G2) but not to the positively signaling molecules (Ly49 D and H; reference 37). These experiments mean that any viral enhancement effects due to administration of the 1F8 mAb in vivo are likely a consequence of its action on true NK cells, not NK/T cells, as the 5E6 mAb, which has no affect on MCMV replication, should deplete virtually all of the 1F8+ NK/T cells in vivo.",

Our results show that the NK cell subsets defined by mAb 1F8 substantially increase at sites of MCMV infection and account for >80% of the IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells. mAb depletion of this subset in vivo resulted in substantially higher titers of MCMV (but not LCMV or VV); depletion of no other two or even four Ly49-expressing subsets gave comparable results 22. The importance of different subsets in mediating other NK cell\u2013dependent functions, in particular that of bone marrow allograft rejection, has been shown previously 21\n40. The mechanism of NK cell subset recognition of allografts is clarifying, at least in some aspects. NK cell subsets displaying Ly49 receptors that are negatively signaled by MHC class I displayed by the graft are ineffective at mediating rejection. However, recently we have shown that NK cells lacking inhibitory receptors but expressing allo-MHC positive-signaling receptors, such as Ly49D, are most effective at eliciting graft rejection 40. mAb 1F8 cross-reacts between the very closely related Ly49 C, I, and H, but costaining and in vivo depletion experiments with mAb 5E6, which recognizes Ly49C/I, indicated that those reactivities did not account for the efficacy of the Ab. Hence, it is noteworthy that the presence of a positively signaling ligand, Ly49H, may be necessary for anti-viral activity, just as a positive-signaling Ly49 is crucial for bone marrow rejection.",

Bone marrow transplants display the types of molecules (class I) known to be ligands for Ly49 molecules and other NKRs, but virus infections are entirely different entities, and viral replication could well be controlled by purely nonspecific inflammatory mechanisms that have nothing to do with NK subsets or NK cell recognition. For instance, relatively nonspecific inflammatory mediators such as type I IFN, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and MIP-1\u03b1 can contribute to the activation and proliferation of NK cells and their infiltration into tissues 41. Those NK cells may be highly cytolytic and be nonspecifically producing copious amounts of IFN-\u03b3, which could control infection without any form of recognition. In fact, it had been suggested that a reason why MCMV but not LCMV is susceptible to NK cells is that MCMV induces more IL-12, which in turn, enables NK cells to produce more IFN-\u03b3 35\n41. This hypothesis is challenged by the fact that in mice dually infected with both MCMV and LCMV, only MCMV is controlled by NK cells 42. Alternatively, NK cell subsets could matter, if the virus changes the expression level of MHC class I antigens on infected cells 43, if it qualitatively alters the nature of a class I molecule by the insertion of a virus-encoded peptide 44\n45, or if the virus encodes its own class I molecule 46. MCMV indeed does downregulate host MHC expression and does encode a class I molecule, m144; experiments to date, however, have indicated that its class I homologue may make MCMV more resistant, rather than sensitive to NK cells, perhaps by interacting with a negatively signaling NKR 46. The possibility also exists that a virus might encode a surface glycoprotein that directly triggers an NK cell subset, and a substantial amount of work done before the discovery of NKRs had indicated that many purified viral glycoproteins can trigger NK cells 47\n48.",

It is therefore possible that the putative Cmv-1 protein is an Ly49 molecule. This locus controls the replication of MCMV mostly in the spleen but less so in the liver 7. NK cells mediate control of MCMV by different mechanisms in these two organs. Replication in the liver is controlled by IFN-\u03b3, whereas replication in the spleen is controlled primarily by a perforin-dependent mechanism, suggesting cytotoxicity 18\n19. Our assays in this study focused only on IFN-\u03b3 production, but we presume that those 1F8+ NK cells also have cytolytic activity. Indeed, our preliminary data with IFN-\u03b3\u2013deficient mice show that mAb 1F8 dramatically elevates spleen viral titers, consistent with an additional mechanism such as perforin being involved in control of MCMV. Depletion of the 1F8+ subset in normal C57BL/6 mice affected viral titers and enhanced pathology in both spleen and liver, an observation that may be inconsistent with the effects of Cmv-1, which are noted mostly in the spleen. However, the effects on viral titers were much greater in the spleen than in the liver, possibly consistent with the Cmv-1 phenotype. It is ironic that the effects of mAb 1F8 are so profound in the spleen when, if anything, the 1F8+ NK cells appear to be recruited away from the spleen and into other sites of infection. It of course is not clear whether the reductions in viral titers within the spleen are due to NK cells acting within the spleen or to NK cells controlling virus before it can get into the spleen. The relationship between Cmv-1 and the studies presented here is unclear. The Ly49H gene lies slightly outside the area in chromosome six mapped for the Cmv-1 locus 49\n50. Thus, it may represent another factor of resistance. However, it remains possible given the complexities of the Ly49 family of related genes that the mapping is not completely accurate or that the 1F8 mAb cross-reacts with another as yet undefined Ly49 molecule mapping within the region where Cmv-1 may lie. Of note is that the influence of Cmv-1 is not strongly dependent on an MHC allotype, as this C57BL/6 (H2b) mouse locus has been bred into a normally sensitive Balb/c (H2d) background and still manifests antiviral activity 51. Balb/c mice do not normally express Ly49H, so it would be interesting to selectively introduce this gene into the Balb/c background and determine whether it promotes resistance to MCMV.",

However, why 1F8+ NK cells are so good at producing IFN-\u03b3 after viral infections does not seem to be associated with any selective sensitivity to IL-12, as they are the major IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells even in mice lacking IL-12 p40 receptor (unpublished observations). The total number of NK cells and the percent of NK cells producing IFN-\u03b3 is lower in IL-12R KO mice, but the 1F8+ cells remain the predominant IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cell population, accounting for >75% of the IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells.
