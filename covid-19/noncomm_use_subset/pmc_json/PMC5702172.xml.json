The functional differences between these facilities are unclear; therefore, there is an increased need to strengthen primary care centered on clinics.1,2 Starfield3 evaluated the elements composing the primary health care system of a country and reported that the lower the level of primary health care, the more it affected health outcomes, health care expenditures, and patient satisfaction. A study that applied the same criteria in Korea revealed a low level of primary care;4 during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015, patients\u2019 ability to report directly to a tertiary hospital without undergoing a proper referral process was identified as the main cause of MERS contamination.5 One study found that up to 85% of patients chose tertiary hospitals over primary care institutions such as clinics, mostly based on the preferences of patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension.6 In 2009, the Ministry of Health and Welfare increased outpatient out-of-pocket payments for tertiary hospitals to promote the utilization of clinics, but the effect was found to be partial.7",

Principal axis factoring was used as an estimation method; the number of factors was determined using Kaiser\u2019s criteria (eigenvalue >1). The squared multiple correlations of each variable with all other variables were used as the prior communality estimates. If the number of factors satisfying Kaiser\u2019s criteria was insufficient, it was determined using a cumulative variation. Items with \u22650.4 factor loading were included as the final factors.

The expected roles and patient needs varied depending on the type of institution. Each type of patient expected different types of medical services: patients visiting clinics and hospitals expected kind and patient-centered services, while those visiting tertiary hospitals expected a good reputation and structural factors (the most modern facilities and equipment and public reporting of quality). The health care public service evaluation implemented in Korea includes hospital accreditation and itemized evaluations of the appropriateness of individual services, which target the structure, process, and outcomes. However, the structure had the greatest influence on the evaluation results,22 based on the patients\u2019 preferences.23 Therefore, modern facility and equipment and the public reporting of quality were both classified as \u201cquality of health care\u201d.",
