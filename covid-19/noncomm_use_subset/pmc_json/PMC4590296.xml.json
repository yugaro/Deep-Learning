The source of this pharmacological activity is a number of active components of which glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is considered the most important. This has led to its adoption as a marker compound of the quality of G. uralensis. Many studies have shown that GA possesses antiinflammatory, antiturmor and immune-stimulating activities3\u20137.",

As shown in Fig. 4c, the relative expression of the GuHMGR gene in the recombinant P. pastoris strain containing 4 copies was higher than in the other strains consistent with the results listed in Table 3 (P<0.05 for the strain containing 4 copies versus all other strains).",

Then when an enzyme level decreases, feedback inhibition may be interrupted leading to reopening of the metabolic pathway which could explain why the level of ergosterol is increased in the P. pastoris strain containing 44 copies of the GuHMGR gene.",

Nevertheless we maintain that the current results provide an important basis for further studies aimed at increasing the GA content of G. uralensis and exploring its biosynthesis in vitro. In addition, other herbs used in Chinese medicine such as Glycyrrhiza glabra and Glycyrrhiza inflate also produce GA and this work is relevant to further studies of its biosynthesis in these medicinal plants.",
