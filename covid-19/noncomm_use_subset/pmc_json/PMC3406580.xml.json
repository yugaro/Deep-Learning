Myosin II ATPase activity, together with the GTPase ROCK-I, is necessary for cell membrane fragmentation into multiple apoptotic bodies in the execution phase of apoptosis. Also, we analyzed the effect of Y-27632, a ROCK-I inhibitor that blocks membrane blebbing. We then compared final infective virus production at 48 hpi when these drugs were added to the cells, either 2 h before infection, or at 6 hpi. Our results showed that neither blebbing nor caspase 3 inhibition modified total virus production (extracellular plus intracellular virus production; Figure 2a). Caspase 3 activation in early stages of the infection was required for virus exit, whereas the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell and this effect was enhanced when the inhibitor was added 6 hpi (Figure 2b). In order to asses a possible role of caspase 12 in caspase 3 and 9 activation, we analyzed the effect of caspase 12 inhibition in infected cells using Z-ATD-FMK. Addition of this inhibitor before infection did not affect percentages of ASFV-infected cells as detected by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS); Figure 3a). Also, this inhibitor did not cause a decrease in virus production nor in the exit of virus particles (Figure 3b). Moreover, our results showed that neither caspase 3 nor caspase 9 were inhibited by Z-ATD-FMK and only caspase 12 activation was specifically inhibited (Figure 3c).",

This response is an autoregulatory program that upregulates a large number of genes, such as ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components, which increase the folding capacity of the ER.26 In order to determine whether ASFV infection induces this response, we used western blot analysis to monitor the expression levels of the ER chaperones BiP, calreticulin, calnexin, ERp57 and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) over the course of the infection. Calreticulin and calnexin were induced upon ASFV infection at 16 hpi (Figure 4a), while only a modest increase in PDI levels was found at 48 hpi. Interestingly, ASFV did not induce the expression of ERp57 or BiP. Chaperone upregulation was coincident with the expression of viral protein p30. Actin levels remained constant during the course of the infection, indicating that chaperone induction was not caused by a global upregulation of protein translation. We also analyzed the expression of BiP by inmunofluorescence. Cells treated with tunicamycin showed a typical ER pattern for BiP, while BiP expression was undetectable in non-treated/non-infected controls and infected cells (Figure 4c). This could be probably due to the low levels of BiP to be detected by the antibody.",

Therefore, it appears that the infection did not increase levels of active XBP1 mRNA. XBP1 mRNA is spliced by IRE1 but is induced by ATF6 activation.6 The level of endogenous XBP1 mRNA was measured in infected cells using qRT-PCR analysis of RNAs from ASFV-infected samples.

The short promoter shows considerably less activity than the full promoter and GFP-ATF6 expressed under the short CMV promoter localizes exclusively to the ER and translocates to the nucleus, in a similar way to endogenous ATF6.32 Cells transfected with the pCMV short-EGFP-ATF6 plasmid presented a typical ER pattern that relocated to the Golgi apparatus (Figure 6b) or to the nucleus (Figure 6c) in response to tunicamycin treatment. However, this characteristic pattern was modified in infected cells. Cells transfected with this construct and infected with ASFV showed GFP-ATF6 localization either in discrete perinuclear cytoplasmic areas corresponding to viral factories, as indicated by their co-localization with DNA stain (Figures 6d and e), or in the nucleus of infected cells (Figure 6f). This finding indicates that ASFV activates the ATF6 pathway of the UPR. We next studied the effect of a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits ER stress-induced proteolysis of ATF6, AEBSF33 on ASFV infection. Addition of this inhibitor before infection affected the percentages of ASFV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner as detected by FACS (Figure 7a). AEBSF also induced a strong inhibition of viral production resulting in 100% reduction of viral titer at 300 \u03bcM concentrations of AEBSF (data not shown). We analyzed caspase activation under AEBSF to find that this agent abrogated caspase 3, 9 and 12 activation in infected cells. Inhibition of caspases was dependent of AEBSF effect on infection, given that this serine protease inhibitor did not prevent activation of caspase 3 induced by staurosporine (Figure 7b).",

We analyzed the mechanism by which ASFV induces apoptosis in infected cells and observed that caspases 3 and 9 are activated with similar kinetics as of 16 hpi. However, ASFV-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase 8 activation, a process involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These results indicated that the virus induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway rather than the death receptor-mediated pathway. ASFV triggers apoptosis in an early stage of the infection process.34 Nevertheless, extensive apoptosis of infected cells occurs only at late post-infection times. Programmed cell death itself might be relevant for the release of virus particles into apoptotic bodies, which would provide a mechanism to facilitate virus spread and evasion of the immune system. Our results show that caspase 3 activation in early stages of the infection, was relevant for virus exit and that membrane blebbing contributes to virus dissemination, given the fact that the inhibition of the effector caspase 3 reduced the release of virus particles from the cell and this effect was enhanced when the inhibitor was added after 6 hpi. Thus, ASFV takes advantage of an early induction of apoptosis, through caspase 3 activity, while the final execution of programmed cell death in apoptotic blebs contribute to ASFV invasion of host cells and evasion of the immune surveillance. In addition to its critical role in apoptosis, caspase 3 participates in other cellular processes.35 This could also be the case of ASFV infection, where activation of caspase 3 may be required during early stages of infection to ensure subsequent virus exit from the cell. Another example is the influenza virus infection, in which caspase 3 inhibitors prevent the formation of progeny influenza A virus particles.36",

            "text": "We have also shown that ASFV infection in Vero cells induces caspase 12, although this induction is not required for viral production or for caspases 3 and 9 activation. Caspase 12 is a characteristic ER stress response caspase. Virus assembly begins with the modification of ER membranes, which are subsequently recruited to the viral factories and transformed into viral precursor membranes.37 Moreover, a large amount of viral proteins are synthesized and accumulated in infected cells, thus overloading the ER-folding capacity. This overload can lead to the activation of the ER stress response of the host cell. Activated caspase 12, a key marker of ER stress-mediated apoptosis, may potentially interact with another pro-apoptotic protein, Bap31, resulting in a feedback mechanism involving the release of cytochrome c elicited through the mitochondrial pathway.38 However, Bap31 was not activated by the fragmentation of p20 in ASFV-infected cells. This observation indicates the absence of direct pro-apoptotic signals between the ER and mitochondria. Caspase 12 was triggered in ASFV-infected cells but this activation does not necessarily result in apoptosis, because the virus has the capacity to block ER stress at a later step. In general, ER stress starts with the transcriptional induction of ER-localized chaperones as a survival signal. Molecular chaperones are key components of the ER machinery; their main function consists of ensuring the quality of the ER by maintaining newly synthesized proteins in a proper state for folding, and marking misfolded proteins for degradation. Two folding systems have been proposed to contribute to this quality control. One of these is composed of grp78 (BiP), grp94 and PDI. The second system, known as the \u2018calnexin\u2013calreticulin cycle', includes calnexin, calreticulin and ERp57.39 Chaperone expression analysis of ASFV-infected cells revealed a marked increase in calnexin and calreticulin expression from 16 hpi, and to a lesser extent, of PDI at 48 hpi. However, ASFV did not induce the expression of ERp57, which, together with calnexin and calreticulin, assists disulfide bond formation in glycoprotein folding. Surprisingly, ASFV did not elicit the expression of grp78 (BiP), thereby indicating that the virus contains the ER stress at this level.",

The inhibition of this UPR branch results in an attenuation of protein translation. To avoid this, ASFV encodes the DP71L gene, a GADD34 homolog that interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP1, and activates its phosphatase activity40 and that also promotes the expression of cellular GADD34, as shown here.",
