The human OAS family consists of four genes, OAS1 (p40/p46; the short form), OAS2 (p69/p71; the intermediate form), OAS3 (p100; the long form), and OASL (OAS-like protein; p59), which are located on chromosome 12. Because OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 can synthesize 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP upon binding to double-stranded (ds)RNA, it was thought that these three enzymes are involved in the activation of ribonuclease L (RNaseL) during viral infection (3). During infection with RNA viruses, viral dsRNA directly binds to and activates OAS1-3, resulting in the production of 2-5A from ATP (4); 2-5A leads to the dimerization and activation of RNaseL, which cleaves viral and host RNA, thereby blocking viral replication and inhibiting viral protein synthesis (5).",

Polymorphism at the OAS1 locus has also been implicated in susceptibility to enteroviruses and respiratory syncytial virus (8, 9). Structural and biochemical studies show that human OAS1 undergoes a conformational change to recognize dsRNA, resulting in the production of 2-5A (10). However, OAS1 produces short 2-5A, which is much less able to activate RNaseL than are the forms of 2-5A generated by OAS2 and OAS3 (11). Furthermore, enzymatically inactive OAS1 can inhibit viral replication in vitro, suggesting that OAS1 can play various roles in the regulation of signaling pathways during viral infection (3). However, the functions of OAS1 in immune cells have yet to be investigated.",

A lower concentration of dsRNA is needed for OAS3 activation than for OAS1 activation, and 2-5A synthesized by OAS3 is longer than the 2-5A synthesized by OAS1 (11). A structural study of human OAS3 revealed that it is specialized for binding long dsRNA (12). Moreover, consistent with these properties of OAS3, it was recently reported that OAS3 is mainly responsible for activating RNaseL during viral infection of human cell lines (the lung carcinoma cell line A549 and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080) (13). However, there are large differences in the basal expression of OAS proteins among different cell types (14), which results in cell-type-specific effects. Activation of the OAS/RNaseL pathway increased IFN production in fibroblasts, which have low levels of OASs, but suppressed it in macrophages, which have high basal levels of OASs (15). Although OAS3 is a dominant factor for RNaseL activation in fibroblasts, it is possible that other OASs might play this role in macrophages, and/or that OAS3 itself plays a different role in macrophages. In addition, because OAS3 has a nuclear import sequence and is mainly localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, OAS3 proteins may have a role in gene regulation during viral infection (16). Therefore, investigating OAS3-induced genes during viral infection in the major viral target-cell type, human macrophages, is required to understand the antiviral immune response.",

OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells stimulated with intracellular poly(I:C) showed strong transcriptional changes (more than four-fold) in 244 genes, mostly enriched in the innate immune-response ontology group (Fig. 2A). In general, OAS1\u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells transfected with poly(I:C) showed a transcription profile similar to that of OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells. However, several genes were significantly increased or decreased by intracellular poly(I:C) in OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells but not in WT or OAS1\u2212/\u2212 cells. The genes that were upregulated in both OAS1\u2212/\u2212 and OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells were predominantly involved in type I IFN signaling, viral defense responses, and chemokine activity, whereas the genes that were downregulated were mostly involved in transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling, nuclear envelope organization, and negative regulation of intrinsic apoptosis signaling (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1). Focusing on the genes related to type I IFN signaling, transcripts encoding IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), ISG15, ISG20, IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), guanine nucleotide-binding protein 1 (GBP1), and OASL were all upregulated in OAS1\u2212/\u2212 and OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells treated with intracellular poly(I:C) compared with WT cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, many chemokines, including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10, showed abundant changes in transcription levels in poly(I:C)-transfected OAS1\u2212/\u2212 and OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 2B). However, the magnitude of these changes was much greater in OAS3\u2212/\u2212 cells than in OAS1\u2212/\u2212 cells. These sequencing results suggest that OAS1 and OAS3 are both negative regulators of dsRNA-dependent antiviral responses, but that OAS3 modulates these responses more strongly than OAS1.",

However, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 can all synthesize 2-5A in vitro in human cell lines, and their basal expression is higher in macrophages than in fibroblasts (11, 15). Thus, the ability of each OAS family member to induce 2-5A synthesis may differ by cell type.
