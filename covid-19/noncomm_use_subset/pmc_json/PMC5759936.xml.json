Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is continued for a period of another 12 to 29 weeks after wound healing.5,6 During the chemotherapy period, other functional supplement plant extracts may be beneficial.",

            "text": "Toona sinensis Roem (Meliaceae; TS), which grows mostly in Asia, is widely used as a medicine and especially as a vegetable. The bark is used as an astringent and depurative agent, the root is used as refreshment and diuretic agents, the tender leaves are used as carminative and corrective agent, and its fruit is used as astringent and in treatment of eye infections. Especially leaves and young shoots, which have been used as a vegetable in China for thousands of years, are used as the treatment of enteritis, dysentery, and itch in oriental medicine.7 The aqueous extract of TS leaf (TSL) possesses antioxidant,8-10 antidiabetes,11 antivirus,12 and antiseptic13 activity. In addition, TSL shows potent antiproliferation effect on many types of cancer, including leukemia, lung, oral squamous carcinoma, prostate, and ovary.14-20 Previous studies found that crude extracts from the TSL exerted potent antiproliferative effects on A549 lung cancer cells, H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma), and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma).16,17,19,21 It was also reported that crude extracts from TSL exert potent antiproliferative effects via decreased Bcl-2 protein accompanied by increased Bax protein level in H441 cells.16 However, the effects of TSL on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. In this study, we tested the effects of TSL-1, an advanced fraction of TSL crude extraction, on cell viability and cytotoxicity in human osteosarcoma cell lines, U2-OS, Saos-2, and MG-63, and on tumor growth in xenograft tumor.",

The mixture of water and leaves was boiled for 30 minutes and then cooled down slowly for at least 2 hours at room temperature. The debris was then removed and remaining liquid was concentrated by incubating in low heat and filtered with a sieve (70-mesh). The filtered concentrate was lyophilized with a Virtis apparatus to obtain a crude extract. Following this procedure, different fractions of TSL\u2014TSL-1, TSL-5, and TSL-7\u2014were obtained following the aforementioned procedure by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, the powder was then dissolved in 99.5% ethanol and was centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4\u00b0C (Beckman AvantiTM J-30I) for 12 minute to give a supernatant portion and a precipitate portion.

            "text": "Among the conventional antitumor cytotoxic chemotherapies, many compounds are derived from natural products.29 Natural compounds have acted as cancer adjuvant agents and therapeutics in cancer treatment.30 More than half of the current anticancer drugs originate from natural sources.31 Modulation of apoptosis signaling pathways by natural compounds is a key point in their antitumor activities.32 A previous study found gallic acid, a major component of TSL, contains a reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2013mediated anticancer activity through generation of ROS and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in DU145 human prostate cancer cells.20 In addition to gallic acid, some fractions of TSL were also found to have antitumor activities including TSL-1 and TSL-2. TSL-1 induced 3 different non\u2013small-cell lung cancer cell lines, H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma), and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma), toward apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 and increasing Bax protein levels at the dose of 0.5 and 1 mg/mL.16 The dose was much higher than our study, which was only less than 0.2 mg/mL. Additionally, we only found Bad expression change in Saos-2 cells. Chang et al found TSL-2 also induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 at a dose 0.5 mg/mL via inducing the expression of Bax at 1 hour after treatment.19 The dose of TSL-2 was also much higher than our study, and the apoptotic gene changes were different to ours. TSL-2 also decreased tumor size in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.67 and 6.7 \u00b5g/g in a nude mouse xenograft model.19 The crude extract of TSL (10-75 \u00b5g/mL) was also found to induce apoptosis of human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner via reducing the protein levels of Bcl-2 and increasing that of Bax.33 The dose for apoptosis of human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells was much higher than that required for Saos-2 cells, and the mechanisms in apoptosis was different. In addition, the crude extract of TSL at the dilution of 64 times induced apoptosis of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.21 Some studies also showed similar results with different extraction protocols of TSL. Chia et al found TS extract (0.5 g/mL) induced apoptosis in human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines, including UM1, UM2, SCC-4, and SCC-9, by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes such TNF-\u03b1, TP53BP2, and GADD45A, and downregulating the anti-apoptotic genes Survivin and cIAP1.18 The dose required in this study was very high, more than 1000 times than that in our study, and the mechanisms were different from ours. Yang et al reported TS extract, betulonic acid, and 3-oxours-12-en-28-oic acid inhibited the proliferation of MGC-803 and PC3 cells. Both components induced apoptosis at 20 \u00b5M by increasing p53, Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 protein levels.14 Zhen et al found decoctions from TS induced cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa arrest at S phase without inducing apoptosis.34 Chen et al found TSL-1 (0.375 and 0.5 mg/mL) induces apoptosis through the generation of ROS and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in human renal carcinoma cell lines (786-O and A-498).35 The dose was somewhat higher than ours, and the mechanism was also different. The antitumor effect of TS is not a specific finding of our group. Though the mechanism is not completely same as previous studies, there may be some differences in the pre-apoptotic effect of TSL between different cancer cell lines. In addition, we found an IC50 dosage of TSL-1 on human osteosarcoma cell lines 10 times lower than that on H441 cells in our study; it was also lower than H661 cells, H520 cells,16 SKOV3 cells,19 HL-60 cells,33 UM1 cells, UM2 cells, SCC-4 cells, SCC-9 cells,18 786-O cells, and A-498 cells35 from previous studies. Our results indicates that TSL-1 reveals a high efficiency on inhibiting cell viability of human osteosarcoma cells, which may be a choice as an adjuvant functional plant extract for human osteosarcoma.",
