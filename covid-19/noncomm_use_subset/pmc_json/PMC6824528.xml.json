However, in no combination was the dual infection significantly worse than in both of the individual viruses. Furthermore, as a class effect, it does not appear that infection with >1 virus increases severity of disease. Many of the confidence intervals for the combinations include no difference for each of the comparisons with the individual viruses. Based solely on point estimates, which may change with increasing numbers of participants, there appear to be some patterns that indicate a leading or governing effect of 1 virus in the combination. An example of this is the combination of CoV+RSV (Figure 2C, panel C); CoV cases and CoV+RSV cases were less severe than cases of only RSV. Moreover, the severity of CoV+RSV cases was no different than that of CoV cases. This could indicate that CoV is the leading/governing agent in the combination. Similarly, HBoV may be governing RV in the combination of these 2 viruses (panel J), RV governing CoV (panel K), influenza governing HBoV (panel N), and RV governing RSV (panel P). The confidence intervals around the combinations are often large and include 1, so these interpretations are not conclusive and could differ if larger numbers of participants were studied. However, the pattern observed in the point estimates is suggestive of the governing effect described above and warrants further study.",

It is possible that these results could reflect sequential infections rather than simultaneous infection and that symptoms (and hospitalization) could be the result of only 1 of the 2 viruses. The sample collection time with respect to the course of illness would then be an important factor. In a study carried out in participants with ILI, viral co-infections were detected more frequently in samples obtained during the first 2 days from symptom onset compared with those obtained after 3\u20137 days [21]. Thus, it is plausible that detection of co-infections might be the result of prolonged shedding of 1 virus with a subsequent infection with the second virus. Also, it could reflect a reduced ability of a second virus to replicate due to an already initiated host response and the production of interferon as a result of an initial viral infection. Interference of 1 virus with another virus has been shown to occur in vitro [22], and epidemiological studies suggest that circulation of 1 virus might affect circulation of another virus in communities [23].",

The RSV and HMPV finding is consistent with other reports that show these viruses to be leading causes of LRTI in children and adults [28\u201330]. In contrast, the role of HBoV as a cause of severe infections is less well established. Because HBoV infection is very common and frequently found in asymptomatic participants, the pathogenic role of this virus has been questioned [31, 32]. Children with higher viral loads tend to have more severe infections [33], longer hospitalization duration [34, 35], and are found to have co-infection by other viruses [36, 37] less frequently than those with lower viral loads. However, in children in daycare, viral load had no apparent association with severity of illness [31], which also might reflect challenges in reproducibly measuring viral load in secretions. In all, these studies suggest that HBoV is frequently present in children as an asymptomatic or chronic infection with low viral loads, whereas some infections in which a high viral load is present may be associated with severe infections requiring hospitalization. Our study did not measure viral load, so it is unclear if our HBoV participants represented a sample of high\u2013viral load participants, as we did not include asymptomatic participants with HBoV.",

The majority of studies have focused on children, and the effect of mixed viral infections in adults is less clear [40]. One of the strengths of this analysis is that our study population included both pediatric and adult symptomatic participants. Although some comparisons resulted in estimates with wide confidence intervals, our interpretation based on point estimates revealed several patterns and could be hypothesis-generating for future studies.",

To assess the differences in hospitalization rates of mixed respiratory infections, it is necessary to carry out analyses between specific combinations of viruses. When 2 viruses are detected, it appears that the clinical severity of a respiratory infection, as defined by hospitalization, may be associated with 1 of these agents. Future studies with a larger number of participants designed to distinguish between sequential and simultaneous infection and using direct measures of patient health status should be of help in defining the role of each virus during the evolution of an acute respiratory episode.",
