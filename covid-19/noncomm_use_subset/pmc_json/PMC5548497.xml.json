            "text": "ASTHO, like many national public health associations, enjoyed rapid growth in the 1990s as federal grants and contracts created new opportunities for public health organizations to provide technical assistance and training on a variety of public health issues. The primary funding partners for these cooperative agreements were the agencies that worked most with state and territorial health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). However, over time, programs with the Office of Minority Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the National Highway and Safety and Transportation Administration along with other agencies also built the capacity of the state and territorial health agencies and ASTHO. These investments allowed ASTHO to offer technical assistance and training as well as grow internal operational and organizational capacity for communications activities and policy work. Main topic areas of these projects included addressing communicable disease, chronic disease, maternal and child health, environmental health, health systems change, health equity, and public health informatics and surveillance capacity. Work to build the public health workforce and assess the capacity of local and state public health agencies was also started in the 1990s through agreements with the CDC, HRSA, and national philanthropic partners including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the de Beaumont Foundation, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.",

The SHLI provided the opportunity for the ASTHO Executive Director to visit new S/THOs, supported S/THO leadership development through an executive leadership institute at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, to offer experienced S/THO mentorships to new S/THOs, and to convene annually in an S/THO-only strategic session. Now in its 18th year, the SHLI has expanded to include both executive leadership development and multisector leadership training to develop S/THOs' abilities to create a \u201cculture of health\u201d within their jurisdictions. Similar workforce development investments have allowed ASTHO to convene executive leaders in state and territorial health agencies, including senior deputies, legislative liaisons, and program leads in the areas of public health preparedness, environmental health, informatics, human resources, finance, and several others.",

Amid wide recognition that governmental public health is critical to emergency preparedness and response, large investments were made at the local and state levels in public health preparedness capacity nationwide. ASTHO received federal dollars through cooperative agreements with the CDC and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to convene state and territorial public health officers and preparedness directors, support state efforts to build preparedness and response programs, and assist in national disasters and emergencies as a response partner. The modern era of \u201cpublic health preparedness\u201d had begun as did a \u201cnew normal\u201d in public health that required active involvement in homeland security efforts on a basis of 24 hours, 7 days a week. Discussions around how federal dollars for preparedness should be allocated at the state and local levels led to the development of the ASTHO-NACCHO (National Association of County & City Health Officials) Joint Council. Convening health officers to discuss coordinated emergency response efforts to Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the H1N1 outbreak, and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak laid the groundwork for ASTHO's role in supporting state and territorial health agencies and federal partners during public health disasters. Working collaboratively with NACCHO, the ASTHO-NACCHO Joint Council also became an increasingly important factor in policy formulation and advocacy for governmental public health.",

That effort grew into the local and state health department accreditation program incorporated by ASTHO, NACCHO, APHA, and NALBOH, a new 501c3 named the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) and on which ASTHO has an ex-officio seat. As of 2016, a total of 22 state and territorial health agencies have received PHAB accreditation.3",

Programs to address the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases also expanded in the 1990s and early 2000s as the United States witnessed large jumps in the rates of overweight and obesity nationwide. In 2005, ASTHO was one of 4 founding members of the National Forum on Heart Disease and Stroke. ASTHO also created the Alliance to Make US Healthiest, a national certification program recognizing excellence in workplace wellness. In 2009, ASTHO president Judy Monroe called on S/THOs to \u201cWalk the Talk\u201d on obesity prevention and commit personally and professionally to increasing physical activity and lead efforts to promote healthier lifestyles. This effort began the ASTHO \u201cPresident's Challenge\u201d program, in which the ASTHO president calls on peers to actively address specific public health issues or topics (Table 1). ASTHO President's Challenges have led to significant work on several priority issues at the local, state, and federal levels including major work on preventing premature birth and infant mortality.",

ASTHO also continues to cultivate the ASTHO Affiliate Council: a group of other state and territorial health organizations with specific constituencies such as chronic disease directors, health care accreditation agencies, public health nurses, oral health directors, HIV/AIDS directors, maternal and child health program directors (Table 2). In recent years, ASTHO also built its tracking capacity to monitor state and territorial legislative activity pertaining to public health. ASTHO maintains an active database of state and territorial legislative initiatives that relates to health and partners with peer associations including the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and National Association of Attorneys General.4",

            "text": "The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in March 2010 created new opportunities for state and territorial health agencies and for ASTHO beyond the ACA's core focus on expanding health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program supported the scale and spread of evidence-based home visiting programs in many state and territorial health agencies' maternal and child health programs. New opportunities to prevent chronic diseases, unintentional injury, and other leading causes of morbidity and mortality were established in the nation's first ever source of dedicated funding for prevention: the Prevention and Public Health Fund. ASTHO supports several Prevention and Public Health Fund programs including the Million Hearts Initiative, tobacco use prevention, and initiatives to expand breast-feeding at the state and territorial levels. The ACA also led to new challenges for ASTHO and its members. Questions about the public health agency role as a safety net provider were raised and threatened to lead to funding reductions because state health agency efforts were perceived of as duplicative of services covered by health insurers. While concerns that state immunization, STD/STI prevention and control, breast and cervical cancer screening, infant mortality/preterm birth prevention, hypertension, and child and youth with special health care needs programs would be eliminated by the ACA have not been realized, there are lingering questions about why public health agencies are funded to provide the delivery of clinical services when the population traditionally served by state and territorial health agencies is now Medicaid eligible or may obtain health insurance coverage through the federal health care exchange.",

As discussions over the federal budget and deficit spending continue in Washington, District of Columbia, many public health leaders believe that overall federal public health funding will be cut by Congress in future federal budgets, having a profound impact on the work of state and territorial health agencies as well as ASTHO. Future work at ASTHO to \u201cmake the case\u201d for sustained investment in public health and defend against potential cuts builds on past efforts to illustrate the impact of funding reductions to public health. A new area of work at ASTHO is activity to demonstrate the return on investment of many public health programs administered by ASTHO members. ASTHO's ability to lead in public health advocacy and policy will be even more critical in the years to come as efforts to prevent disease and promote health continue to increase and government funding for public health is potentially reduced.",

The role of public health in injury prevention, chronic disease prevention, communicable disease control, and environmental health is as important as ever.

Leaders of state and territorial public health agencies of the future, as described by Fraser and Castrucci on pages 543\u2013551 of this Special Section, will need to have the capacity to synthesize vast amounts of data, solve complicated public health problems, and push for policy changes that have the most impact on addressing health equity and ensuring optimal health for all in an environment of resource constraint.
