            "text": "Transcription attenuation sensing specific uncharged tRNA is a sophisticated posttranscriptional mechanism that is used by bacteria to regulate their gene expression. A prime example is the regulation of the trpEDCBA operon in Escherichia coli. The structural genes of this operon are preceded by an mRNA leader that is able to form mutually exclusive secondary structures and contains a small open reading frame (sORF), trpL, with consecutive Trp codons (4). Ribosome pausing at the Trp codons prevents the formation of a terminator hairpin, resulting in structural genes transcription when cellular Trp concentrations are low. At high Trp levels, the leader peptide TrpL is translated efficiently, resulting in the formation of the terminator hairpin and, consequently, transcription termination, thus leading to the release of a small attenuator RNA. In this way, bacteria respond in a very fast and resource-saving manner to amino acid (aa) availability. Similar ribosome-dependent transcription attenuators are widespread (3,5,6). Many Gram-positive bacteria developed different strategies for transcription attenuation of trp operons. For example, Bacillus subtilis utilizes a Trp-activated RNA binding protein (TRAP) while other gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus, harbor a tRNATrp sensing structure (T-box) in the leader of trp mRNA (3,7,8).",

            "text": "Thus, at least three different mechanisms for RNA-based regulation of trp operons evolved in bacteria, indicating the importance of strict posttrancriptional control of Trp biosynthesis for bacterial survival. Most probably, this is due to the fact that Trp is the most costly-to-synthesize amino acid (3). Despite this, many bacteria have split trp operons with only one of them being preceded by a transcription attenuator (3). This raises the question of whether the other trp operons are posttrancriptionally regulated by alternative mechanisms, for example by small RNAs. Small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate virtually all aspects of bacterial physiology, including metabolism and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Mechanistically, they can exert their regulatory function by protein binding or by base pairing with mRNAs (9). Bacterial trans-acting and base-pairing sRNAs are highly versatile due to their capacity to target multiple mRNAs (10\u201312). Typically, such sRNAs display limited complementarity to their targets and need an RNA chaperone, such as Hfq or ProQ, for efficient mRNA binding (9,13). In most cases, the interaction between an sRNA and an mRNA prevents translation and/or destabilizes the mRNA target (9,14,15).",

In contrast, functional sRNAs originating from 5\u2032-UTRs were reported much less frequently and there are very few examples of riboregulators that act both in cis and trans (18). These include the S-adenosylmethionine riboswitches SreA and SreB which act as base-pairing sRNAs that control the expression of a virulence gene in Listeria monocytogenes (19). Further, in L. monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis, a coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) riboswitch was shown to work as a protein-binding sRNA that sequesters a response regulator (20,21). To date, small trans-acting RNAs derived from ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation have not been described.",

In S. meliloti, the structural trp genes are organized into operons trpE(G), trpDC, and trpFBA (3,22), of which only trpE(G) is regulated by transcription attenuation (23). In the past decade, hundreds of sRNA candidates have been detected in S. meliloti (24) and, meanwhile, physiological roles based on direct binding to target mRNAs have been shown for several of them. For example, AbcR1, AbcR2 and NfeR1 were shown to regulate transporter genes (25,26), while RcsR1 was reported to down-regulate the autoinducer synthase encoding mRNA sinI (27), and EcpR1 and GspR were suggested to regulate the cell cycle (28,29). Given that sRNA RcsR1 is transcribed from a position upstream of trpE(G) and is identical to the trpL-derived attenuator RNA (23), a possible role of this particular RNA in the (co)regulation of the trp operons seemed plausible. In line with this hypothesis, RcsR1 was predicted to base-pair with several mRNAs including trpDC and constitutive ectopic RcsR1 overproduction was shown to result in lower trpC mRNA levels (27). However, it was not clear if this was a direct effect of RcsR1 on trpDC mRNA and if it had any functional implications for bacterial gene regulation in response to Trp availability.",

            "text": "Plasmids pDrive-RcsR1 and pRK-SmelRcsR1 (from now on pDrive-rnTrpL and pRK-rnTrpL, respectively; see Supplementary Table S1) were described previously (27). In S. meliloti, pRK-rnTrpL leads to constitutive transcription of rnTrpL from a heterologous ribosomal RNA (rrn) promoter originating from the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter shpaeroides (41). For constitutive overexpression of the B. japonicum rnTrpL homolog Bja-rnTrpL, the corresponding sequence was cloned in the chromosome integration plasmid pRJ-MCS (44) that was cleaved with KpnI and SpeI. Plasmid pRK-rnTrpL-AU1,2UA, which allows for constitutive transcription of an S. meliloti rnTrpL derivative that lacks a functional sORF (replacement of the trpL AUG codon with UAG), was constructed as follows. The rnTrpL-sequence was amplified with primers RcsR1-ATG/TAG-fw and pRKSmelRcsR1re and cloned into pRK4352. To construct pRK-rnTrpL-AU1,2UA-G44C, the same primers were used in a PCR with pRK-rnTrpL-G44C as the template and the amplicon was cloned into pRK4352. To construct pRK-rnTrpL-CG40,41GC and pRK-rnTrpL-GG46,47CC, site-directed mutagenesis of the rnTrpL-sequence in pDrive-rnTrpL was performed by inverse PCR with Phusion polymerase, followed by treatment with DpnI (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The mutated inserts were excised with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pRK4352. To construct plasmid pRK-trpL-egfp, egfp was amplified with primers Bam-RcsR1-egfp-fw and Eco-egfp-re using pLK64 (45) as template, and the amplicon was cloned into pRK4352 using its BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The resulting translational rnTrpL::egfp fusion contains the first six codons of trpL fused to the third codon of egfp. Plasmids pSRKTc-rnTrpL and pSRKGm-rnTrpL for IPTG-inducible transcription of lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL were constructed as follows. The rnTrpL-sequence of S. meliloti was amplified and ligated with NdeI/SpeI-digested pSRKTc or pSRKGm, resulting in an in-frame insertion of the trpL sORF to the ATG of NdeI. Similarly, plasmids pSRKTc-Atu-rnTrpL and pSRKTc-Ec-rnTrpL were constructed by cloning the rnTrpL homologs of A. tumefaciens and E. coli into pSRKTc. To construct pSRKTc-rnTrpL-CG40,41GC and pSRKTc-rnTrpL-GG46,47CC, mutated rnTrpL-sequences were amplified using as template pDrive-rnTrpL-CG40,42GC and pDrive-RcsR1-GG46,47CC, respectively, and cloned into pSRKTc cleaved with NdeI and SpeI. To construct pSRKGm-trpDC\u2019-egfp, the trpDC\u2019 sequence of S. meliloti was amplified with primers NdeI-trpD-fw and 5\u2032-egfp-trpC-re. In parallel, egfp was amplified using pLK64 (45) as template and primers trpC-egfp-fw and XbaI-egfp-re. The two PCR products were mixed and used for overlap-PCR with the primers NdeI-trpD-fw and XbaI-egfp-re. The resulting amplicon was ligated with pJet1.2/blunt, resulting in pJet-trpDC\u2019-egfp. The insert was subcloned into pSRKGm using NdeI and XbaI. The resulting plasmid pSRKGm-trpDC\u2019-egfp allows for IPTG-inducible transcription of a bicistronic trpDC\u2019::egfp mRNA encoding TrpD and the fusion protein TrpC\u2019-EGFP. The fusion construct contains the first 16 trpC codons fused in frame to the third codon of egfp. To introduce compensatory mutations into the trpDC\u2019::egfp reporter, pJet-trpDC\u2019-egfp was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The mutated inserts were subcloned into pSRKGm using NdeI and XbaI, resulting in pSRKGm-trpD-CG985,986GC-trpC\u2019-egfp and pSRKGm-trpD-CC977,978GG-trpC\u2019-egfp. Transconjugants containing one of the pSRK-plasmids were stored at \u201380\u00b0C. Double transconjugants (containing pSRK-plasmids with different antibiotic resistance genes) were used directly after the transfer of the second plasmid to S. meliloti. To construct plasmid pK18mobsacB-\u0394trpL for marker-less deletion of the rnTrpL-sequence in the chromosome of S. meliloti, regions located upstream and downstream of trpL in the chromosome were amplified separately. Overlap PCR was performed and the resulting amplicon was cloned into pK18mobsacB (43), which was cleaved with EcoRI and PstI. Plasmid pK18mobsacB-\u0394trpL was used to delete the chromosomal sequence ranging from the third nucleotide after the rnTrpL transcription start site to the last T in the TTTT stretch of the rnTrpL transcription terminator. Similarly, plasmid pK18mobsacB-\u0394trpC for marker-less in-frame deletion in gene trpC of S. meliloti was constructed. The in-frame deletion construct contains the first ten codons fused to the last nine codons of trpC.",

Cells were lysed in a shacking mill (4\u00b0C), two times for 15 min, interrupted by a 10 min incubation at 65\u00b0C. Then 750 \u03bcl TRIzol was added and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer instructions. After precipitation with isopropanol, the RNA was additionally purified by extraction with hot phenol and chloroform-isoamylalcohol to remove residual RNases. RNA from B. japonicum or E. coli DH5\u03b1 was isolated using hot phenol. For RNA half-life measurements, S. meliloti RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) as described (27). RNA concentration and purity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. RNA integrity was controlled in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gels stained with ethidium bromide.",

The qRT-PCR analysis was performed with Brilliant III Ultra Fast SYBR\u00ae Green QRT-PCR Mastermix (Agilent) according to the manufacturer manual. Each 10 \u03bcl reaction mixture contained 5 \u03bcl Master Mix (supplied), 0.1 \u03bcl DTT (100 mM, supplied), 0.5 \u03bcl Ribo-Block solution (supplied), 0.4 \u03bcl water, 1 \u03bcl of each primer (10 pmol/\u03bcl), and 2 \u03bcl RNA (20 ng/\u03bcl). For Figures 1D and 2C, both primers were added simultaneously before the cDNA synthesis step. For other Figures, strand-specific qRT-PCR was performed. For this, first only the primer needed for cDNA synthesis was added to the reaction mixture. After cDNA synthesis and incubation for 10 min at 96\u00b0C to inactivate the reverse transcriptase, the probes were cooled to 4\u00b0C, the second primer was added, and PCR was performed starting with 5 min incubation at 96\u00b0C. Used primer pairs and their efficiencies (as determined by PCR using serial two-fold dilutions of RNA) are listed in Supplementary Table S2. As a reference mRNA, rpoB was used when mRNA steady-state levels were compared. For half-life measurements, the stable 16S rRNA was used as a reference. For the real-time RT-PCR of this reference molecule, the RNA samples were additionally diluted till the quantification cycle (Cq) of mRNA and 16S rRNA was similar. Routinely, 2 \u03bcl RNA with a concentration of 0.002 ng/\u03bcl was used in a 10 \u03bcl reaction for real-time RT-PCR of 16S rRNA. The reactions were performed in a spectrofluorometric thermal cycle (Biorad). The Cq was set to a cycle at which the curvature of the amplification is maximal (48) using BioRad CFX Manager 3.0. When outlier were identified (e. g. technical duplicate range > 0.5 Cq), the qRT-PCR was repeated. No template-controls were always included. qPCR product specificity was validated by a melting curve after the qPCR-reaction and by gel electrophoresis. Fold changes of mRNA amounts were calculated with the Pfaffl formula (49). All qRT-PCR graphs show means and standard deviations from three independent experiments, each performed in technical duplicates. Northern blot hybridization, signal detection and sRNA bands quantification was performed as described (27,36).",

The RNA was renatured either in AN buffer (DMS probing, 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl) or BN buffer (CMCT probing, 50 mM sodium borate, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, the samples (total volume of 8 \u03bcl) were mixed with 1 \u03bcl of yeast tRNA (2 mg/ml, Ambion) and 1 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfate (DMS; Sigma Aldrich) solution (diluted to 1/2, 1/5, 1/10 and 1/20, respectively, in 20% ethanol) or 1 \u03bcl of 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT; Sigma Aldrich) solution (diluted to 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml, respectively, in RNase/DNase-free water). Control reactions were done under equal conditions in the absence of DMS and CMCT. Following incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Chemical modifications of specific nucleotides by DMS and CMCT, respectively, were determined by primer extension analysis. Briefly, reverse transcription reactions were performed using primer RcsR1-Random_Rev_PE. Aliquots of chemically modified RNAs were hybridized with 1\u20133 pmol of 5\u2032-labeled primer (1\u20132 \u00d7 105 c.p.m.).

Next, the primer annealing mixture was used to set up a 20-\u03bcl reverse transcription reaction in 1 \u00d7 SuperScript\u00ae III RTase reaction buffer supplemented with 170 units of SuperScript\u00ae III RTase (Invitrogen), 20 units RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and 1 mM of each dNTP. The reaction was performed at 42\u00b0C for 50 min and then at 55\u00b0C for 60 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1/10 vol of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 10 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. Following centrifugation, the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol. The dried pellets were resuspended in water and treated with DNase-free RNase A for 20 min at 37\u00b0C (0.2 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Next, PCR-grade proteinase K (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and the reaction was incubated for another 15 min at 55\u00b0C.

Since in E. coli, in medium containing an excess of Trp, approximately 15% of the transcription events proceed into the structural trp genes (60), we tested whether there is a trpLE(G) co-transcription in S. meliloti 2011 grown in TY. qRT-PCR analyses revealed co-transcription and suggested an approximately 45-fold higher steady-state level of rnTrpL when compared to trpLE(G) or trpE(G) (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, in the TY medium routinely used in this work, transcription was efficiently terminated at the attenuator. As a result, the sRNA rnTrpL was accumulated, and was potentially available for regulation in trans, while the readthrough transcript was present at a low level only. To further characterize rnTrpL, we determined its stability in exponentially growing cultures in TY (Supplementary Figure S2). With a half-life of 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 min, the decay of rnTrpL was faster than that of other S. meliloti sRNAs under comparable conditions (50).",

First, we confirmed higher levels for the sRNA rnTrpL in the overexpressing strain S. meliloti 2011 (pRK-rnTrpL) in comparison to the empty vector control strain (EVC) by Northern blot analysis (see Figure 1B and C). The length of the ectopically overproduced sRNA was similar to that of the native sRNA rnTrpL, which was transcribed from the chromosome.

However, there is currently no direct experimental support for the rnTrpL structure. We performed in vitro structural probing to determine experimentally the SL1 and SL3 structures that are expected to be formed in solution (Figure 2A). Based on the probing data, we provide a structure model (Figure 2B) with structural details for the terminator stem-loop. In addition, the model suggests that, with few structural rearrangements involving flexible regions, an alternative (anti-terminator) structure may be formed. According to this model, the sequence predicted to interact with trpD (from nt 21 to nt 55, see also Figure 4A) includes the apical region of SL1. In order to investigate the mechanism by which rnTrpL contributes to reducing trpDC mRNA levels, several mutations were introduced in this rnTrpL region.",

Also, we produced a mutant (AU1,2UA) in which the small ORF trpL (encoding the leader peptide) was eliminated. Using this mutant, we sought to address the question of whether translation of the liberated rnTrpL has any effect on the sRNA-mediated reduction of trpDC levels (see above) or whether the resulting 14-aa peptide translated from this sRNA (independently) affects trpDC mRNA levels (translation of the ectopically overproduced wild type (wt) rnTrpL was confirmed, see Supplementary Figure S3). A double mutant (AU1,2UA-G44C), in which the start and the stop codon of trpL were mutated, was also constructed. In addition, two mutant rnTrpL derivatives constructed previously (G44C and G67C, respectively) (27) were included in our analysis.

Figure 2C shows that all genes of the trpDC operon were affected in a similar manner. The sRNA rnTrpL-AU1,2UA and wt rnTrpL diminished the mRNA levels to a similar extent, suggesting that (under the conditions used in this experiment) ribosome occupancy of rnTrpL and/or the leader peptide were not important for the rnTrpL-mediated effects on trpDC mRNA. In contrast, all mutations that were predicted to weaken the base-pairing between rnTrpL and trpD (see Figure 4A), either abolished the sRNA-mediated downregulation or even led to increased mRNA levels (see the effect of the CG40,41GC mutation in Figure 2C). Further, rnTrpL-G67C, carrying a mutation in a region confirmed to specifically interact with sinI mRNA (27), had a readily detectable negative effect on trpC levels, very similar to that observed for the wt rnTrpL (Figure 2C), suggesting that this mutation did not impede the sRNA\u2019s capability of affecting trpC levels. Altogether, these results support the idea that base-pairing interactions between the apical part of rnTrpL SL1 and trpDC mRNA are involved in mediating the observed decrease in the trpDC mRNA steady-state level upon rnTrpL overproduction.",

In contrast to the parental strain 2011, in which trpC was confirmed to be decreased, the trpC levels were increased in both mutants (Figure 3E). As a control, we also analyzed the changes in sinI (Figure 3E). As expected, the sinI mRNA level was decreased upon rnTrpL induction in strain 2011 (27). A similar decrease was observed in the RNase III mutant 2011\u0394rnc, while an increase was detected in the RNase E mutant 2011rne (Figure 3E). The latter result is in line with the RNase E-dependent downregulation of sinI by rnTrpL (27).

In contrast, if sRNA derivatives carrying CG40,41GC and CC46,47GG mutations, respectively, were co-expressed, no decrease in fluorescence was observed. To test whether this was due to a significantly reduced (or lack of) binding of the mutated sRNAs to trpD in the bicistronic reporter mRNA, appropriate mutations were introduced into the trpD binding site to restore the presumed base-pairing interactions (see Figure 4A). Indeed, a decrease in fluorescence produced by the pSRKGm-trpD-CG985,986GC-trpC\u2019-egfp construct was (only) observed if the corresponding base-pairing sRNA lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL-CG40,41GC was coexpressed. Consistent with this, the fluorescence produced by the pSRKGm-trpD-CC977,978GG-trpC\u2019-egfp construct was (only) decreased if lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL-GG46,47CC sRNA was coexpressed (Figure 4C). These results validate the base-pairing between rnTrpL and trpD and show that this interaction is responsible for the negative effect of rnTrpL on trpDC.",

To test whether rnTrpL affects the decay of this mRNA, half-life measurements were performed with strain 2011\u0394trpL (pSRKTc-rnTrpL). The stabilities of the polycistronic trpDC mRNA and the control mRNA trpE were measured without IPTG addition and 10 min post induction of lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL overproduction. Figure 5 shows that, with primers specific for trpD and trpC, respectively, a decrease in the mRNA half-life upon rnTrpL induction was detectable, while the half-life of trpE mRNA remained unchanged. Similarly, mRNA destabilization upon rnTrpL induction was detected with primers specific for ppiD, moaC and moeA (Supplementary Figure S4). The ppiD- and trpD-specific primers bind upstream of the rnTrpL-binding site in the polycistronic mRNA, while the trpC-, moaC- and moeA-specific primers target downstream regions. Shorter half-lives of all transcript parts upon rnTrpL overproduction is consistent with the proposed destabilization of the polycistronic trpDC mRNA after base-pairing between rnTrpL and trpD.",

To assess transcription attenuation between trpL and trpE(G), we constructed a 2011\u0394trpC mutant to prevent cellular Trp production and used minimal medium with defined Trp concentrations. According to previous data (23), during growth in a medium supplemented with 20 \u03bcg/ml Trp (Trp sufficiency condition), transcription is regularly terminated between trpL and trpEG, and the sRNA rnTrpL is liberated. In contrast, during growth at 2 \u03bcg/ml Trp (Trp insufficiency), transcription termination is abolished and trpL is cotranscribed with trpE(G). Indeed, Figure 6A shows that the sRNA rnTrpL was readily detectable by Northern blot analysis when 2011\u0394trpC was grown at Trp sufficiency. Under these conditions, readthrough transcripts were present at a very low level (Supplementary Figure S1). Large trpLE(G) transcripts could not be detected because the protocol used in this experiment was optimized for efficient separation and blotting of small RNAs. When the cells were washed in medium without Trp and subsequently grown for 4 h in medium supplemented with 2 \u03bcg/ml Trp, the level of rnTrpL was steadily decreased. 10 min after restoring Trp sufficiency, the sRNA rnTrpL level was increased as expected (Figure 6A). Under these conditions, accumulation of a small degradation product of the trpLE(G) transcript was detected (see also Supplementary Figure S5).",

Strains 2011\u0394trpC and 2011\u0394trpC\u0394trpL were used to detect changes in the levels of the polycistronic ppiD-trpD-\u0394trpC-moaC-moeA mRNA and trpE(G) mRNA in response to changes in cellular Trp availability. The experimental setup was as described above (transfer from minimal medium containing 20 \u03bcg/ml Trp to medium containing 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl Trp, incubation for 4 h with sample collection at one-hour intervals and, at the end, incubation with 20 \u03bcg/ml Trp for another 10 min). Upon Trp insufficiency, when the level of the released sRNA rnTrpL was reduced, the level of the polycistronic ppiD-trpD-\u0394trpC-moaC-moeA mRNA was found to be increased in strain 2011\u0394trpC (Figure 6B and C). Importantly, 10 min after restoring Trp sufficiency, when the level of the sRNA rnTrpL was increased again, the level of the polycistronic mRNA was decreased (Figure 6B and C). Similar changes were observed for trpE (Figure 6B). Notably, such changes were not observed in the double mutant 2011\u0394trpC\u0394trpL (Figure 6B and C), suggesting a posttranscriptional downregulation of the trpDC operon by the liberated sRNA rnTrpL in response to Trp availability. In addition, these data lead us to conclude that, similarly to trpE(G) (23), the mRNA level of the trpDC operon is not regulated at the level of transcription initiation in response to Trp availability, but posttranscriptionally by rnTrpL.",

In the three alphaproteobacterial species S. meliloti, A. tumefaciens and B. japonicum, transcription of the attenuator sRNA (and of the bicistronic transcript trpLE(G)) starts with the ATG codon of trpL (64\u201366) (see Supplementary Figure S6). To address the question of whether trp genes are regulated in trans by the rnTrpL homolog in these species, the sequences corresponding to Atu-rnTrpL and Bj-rnTrpL, respectively, were cloned in pSRKTc and pRJ-MCS, respectively. The effect of sRNA overproduction in the corresponding homologous host on the mRNA levels of trpD and trpB were analyzed by qRT-PCR. We found decreased trpD mRNA levels and no change in the levels of trpB upon overexpression of the attenuator sRNA in both A. tumefaciens and B. japonicum (Figure 7A). This indicates that, similarly to what was observed in S. meliloti, trpDC is down-regulated by the attenuator sRNA in trans, while trpFBA is not regulated by this sRNA. To predict base-pairing interactions between A. tumefaciens trpDC and Atu-rnTrpL, as well as between B. japonicum trpDC and Bj-rnTrpL, we used IntaRNA (58). Potential interactions were predicted between SL1 of the respective attenuator RNA and the 3\u2032-region of the respective trpD (Figure 7B; see also Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). Altogether, these results suggest that trpDC regulation by rnTrpL is conserved in the families Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae, to which the studied Alphaproteobacteria belong.",

The remaining enzymes of the pathway, phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase and Trp synthase are encoded by the trpFBA operon. Our data show that ectopic oveproduction of rnTrpL does not influence trpFBA but decreases the steady-state level of the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, in line with the predicted base-pairing between rnTrpL and trpD. Consistent with a direct effect of rnTrpL on trpDC mRNA, a decrease of the trpC level was detected as early as 10 min after induction of lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL in the \u0394trpL background (Figure 3). The results shown in Figure 4C and Figure 5 provide strong support for this hypothesis. Thus, for example, a base complementarity between specific rnTrpL and trpD sequences proved to be required for trpDC downregulation (Figure 4C). Furthermore, parts of the polycistronic mRNA located upstream (in ppiD and trpD) and downstream (in trpC, moaC and moeA) of the rnTrpL binding site were destabilized upon lacZ\u2019-rnTrpL induction (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S4). The latter result shows that rnTrpL acts at the level of trpDC mRNA (rather than DNA, for example, by disturbing transcription). Based on the data presented in this study, we conclude that the attenuator sRNA rnTrpL base-pairs with the distal part of the trpD coding region in the polycistronic trpDC mRNA and thereby promotes degradation of the entire transcript (see the model in Figure 8).",

After an initial endonucleolytic cleavage, RNA fragments are degraded by (other) exo- and endoribonucleases, leading to rapid decay of both the sRNA and the mRNA. Alternatively, inhibition of translation by the sRNA results in unprotected mRNA regions that are endonucleolytically cleaved, mostly by RNase E (9,67), a mechanism suggested for the action of rnTrpL on sinI mRNA (27). According to Figure 3E, both RNase E and RNase III are important for the rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of trpDC. Future analyses are needed to elucidate whether these RNases directly participate in the destabilization of the trpDC message by rnTrpL. Further, according to Figures 2 and 4, the apical region of SL1 of rnTrpL is critically involved in the base-pairing interaction with trpD, suggesting that rnTrpL may need an RNA chaperone for efficient binding to this target. Since rnTrpL was described as an Hfq-independent sRNA (27), and since S. meliloti does not harbor ProQ (13), another RNA-binding protein that interacts with rnTrpL may be identified in the future.",

            "text": "The physiological role of rnTrpL as an attenuator RNA in cis and base-pairing sRNA in trans is an intriguing example for the evolution of bacterial operons and their co-regulation. Although bacteria belonging to Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio and most members of Bacillales and Lactobacillales have all the trp genes in a single operon, most other bacteria (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, and Epsilonproteobacteria, Spirochaeta and most Actinobacteriadae) carry trp genes that are organized into several operons. It has been proposed that this allows for more flexibility in the regulation of the genes involved in each step of Trp synthesis since, in different bacteria, specific Trp precursors have additional functions and are linked to different metabolic pathways (3). However, as already mentioned in the introduction, the high costs of Trp synthesis could pose a selection pressure for evolving RNA-based mechanisms suitable to mediate an appropriate response to varying Trp concentrations in the cell. This is in an apparent contradiction to the observation that, in bacteria with split trp operons, only one of them (usually trpE) is equipped with an mRNA leader that mediates transcription attenuation. Our finding that, in Sinorhizobium, Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, rnTrpL is capable to regulate trpDC in trans provides an example of how bacteria evolved posttranscriptional strategies to coordinate the expression of trp operons according to Trp availability (Figure 8). In contrast, we did not detect posttranscriptional regulation by ectopically overexpressed Ec-rnTrpL in E. coli where all the trp biosynthesis genes are co-transcribed (Figure 7A).",

This pterin-based cofactor is the active compound present in the catalytic site of all molybdenum-containing enzymes except for the bacterial molybdenum nitrogenase (71). The MoCo biosynthesis is highly conserved in all domains of life and enzymes requiring this cofactor are necessary for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism (72). Because the trpLE(G) and ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA operons are conserved in many Alphaproteobacteria and because rnTrpL overexpression downregulates trpD in A. tumefaciens and B. japonicum, we propose that the specific regulatory function of rnTrpL revealed in this study is widely conserved. It is tempting to suggest that, in bacteria with trp genes organized in several operons, the Trp sufficiency status may influence not only the cellular Trp biosynthesis but also other functions, such as protein translocation through the outer membrane and MoCo-dependent metabolic processes.",

Under such conditions, destabilization of sinI mRNA by rnTrpL may impede the autoinducer accumulation and, as a consequence, quorum sensing may begin at higher population density than under conditions of Trp insufficiency. In line with this, it was recently shown that quorum sensing begins at higher population density, when S. meliloti cultures are supplied with water-soluble humic materials as additional nutrient sources (73). Indeed, quorum sensing is known to be influenced by environmental factors in addition to the population density (74). Previously, it was shown that, during growth in TY medium, the steady-state level of rnTrpL is influenced by temperature and salt (27). The effects of these factors on rnTrpL generation and/or decay as well as the regulation of the rnTrpL targets remain to be elucidated.",

(A) Schematic representation of the three trp operons and the attenuator RNA rnTrpL. ORFs are depicted as gray arrows, the RpoD-like promoter is shown as a gray rectangle, a transcription start site is indicated by a flexed arrow and a transcription terminator by a hairpin (according to 23 and 59). The terminated attenuator sRNA rnTrpL (110 nt; synonym RcsR1) is shown as a white box with start and stop codons indicated. Below this box, regions corresponding to stem-loops (SL) 1, 2 and 3 are indicated by convergent arrows. SL2 corresponds to the antiterminator and SL3 to the terminator of transcription. SL2 is preferentially formed in the presence of translating ribosomes that pause upon tRNATrp shortage. For the rnTrpL secondary structure, see Figure 2. The proposed binding site of rnTrpL in the trpD ORF is indicated by a white box. (B) Schematic representation of the plasmid pRK-rnTrpL. Transcription of rnTrpL from this plasmid is expected to be terminated at SL3 in TY medium (see Supplementary Figure S1). (C) Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from the EVC strain 2011 (pRK4352) and the overexpressing strain 2011 (pRK-rnTrpL), grown in TY. The membrane was first hybridized with an rnTrpL-specific probe and subsequently hybridized with a 5S rRNA-specific probe (loading control). (D) Results of qRT-PCR analyses of the indicated mRNAs of the trpDC operon and trpE (control mRNA). Strain 2011 (pRK-rnTrpL) was compared to the EVC and log2(fold change) (log2FC) in mRNA steady-state levels were calculated. Shown are the results from three independent experiments, each performed in technical duplicates (mean values and standard deviations are indicated).",

The pSRK-based plasmids harbor the lac repressor gene lacI with its own promoter, the lacI-lacZ intergenic region, the lac-promoter Plac, and the 38-nt lacZ leader containing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD), followed by an NdeI restriction site containing the ATG translation start codon. Positions of the LacI-binding operators O1 and O3, the proper spacing of which ensures tight regulation at Plac, are indicated (42). The rnTrpL sequence was cloned in frame in the NdeI site of pSRKGm. The resulting sRNA lacZ\u2018-rnTrpL contains the 38-nt lacZ-leader. The scheme shows the plasmid conferring resistance to gentamycin (Gm) (pSRKGm-rnTrpL). A similar plasmid conferring resistance to tetracycline (Tc) was also constructed.

Depletion of the cellular Trp pool causes cotranscription of trpL and trpE(G) and a decrease in the level of the sRNA rnTrpL. 4 h 10 min, following incubation with 2 \u03bcg/ml Trp for 4 h, the Trp concentration was increased to 20 \u03bcg/ml for 10 min. Increased Trp availability led to transcription termination at SL3 of rnTrpL and an immediate increase in the level of the sRNA rnTrpL. The band migrating slower than rnTrpL was identified as a degradation product (degr.) of the trpLE(G) cotranscript (see Supplementary Figure S5).

The liberated attenuator sRNA rnTrpL binds to trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic mRNA ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA. In this way, the trp attenuator posttranscriptionally coordinates the expression of the two trp operons trpE(G) and trpDC in response to Trp availability. In addition, the destabilization of the polycistronic trpDC mRNA by rnTrpL probably affects protein translocation through the outer membrane (ppiD) and MoCo biosynthesis (moaC-moeA). Moreover, the sRNA rnTrpL binds to and destabilizes sinI (27), thus probably linking quorum sensing to Trp availability.",
