Among the neurotropic flaviviruses, JE virus (JEV) is considered the most serious because of its neurotropical impacts, higher fatality rate, and permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (1). The expanding geographical range of JEV and potential for outbreaks of JE in nonimmune populations demand an urgent effort to develop effective antiviral therapies or alternate strategies to limit the immunopathology of JE (2). Indeed, considerable progress in immunopathological studies of JE has been made in both infected patients and murine models (345678). JEV replicates in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) as primary target cells (9), and in these cells, the virus travels from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), where it causes neurological disorders (10).",

The role of DCs in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses like JEV is not fully understood because of their complex multi-cellular interactions with innate-like NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages and functions in immune homeostasis and tolerization (1516). However, CD11c-DTR transgenic (Tg) mice, which express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene under the control of a cloned Itgax promoter and allow conditional DC depletion upon DT injection, have been a critical tool in the in vivo study of DC immunology (17). Using this conditional DC depletion model, we previously demonstrated marked exacerbation of JE progression and abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes following CD11chi DC ablation (18). Moreover, CD11chi DC ablation enhanced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by affecting the regulation of tight junction and adhesion molecules during JE progression (19).",

CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes are known to play a role in regulating host defense and repairing tissues after inflammatory injury, whereas CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes are specifically recruited by CCL2 to inflamed sites, where they become classically activated M1 macrophages and/or Tip-DCs (20). Thus, CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes are known to significantly reduce the immune-privileged status of the CNS (21) and exacerbate the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis (182223). In addition, CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which regulate excessive immune responses, accumulate preferentially over other effector Th cells at inflamed sites because of homing receptors such as CCR5 (242526). In contrast, a skewed IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cell response at inflamed sites may exacerbate JE progression (26). Results of these studies provide insight into how the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes can affect the progression of immunopathological diseases such as JE.",

            "text": "We previously showed that CD11chi DC ablation exacerbated JE progression and resulted in the under-maturation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the BBB (1819). Here, we hypothesized that JE was exacerbated in CD11chi DC-ablated mice through additional mechanisms such as abnormal infiltration and/or maturation of lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes related to pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Since the roles and quantities of CNS-infiltrated CD4+ Th cell subsets, including IFN-\u03b3+ Th1, IL-17+ Th17, and Foxp3+ Tregs, have been not defined, we decided to examine changes in CD4+ Th cell subsets in the spleens and brains of CD11chi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Interestingly, our data revealed that CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi, but IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ Th1 cells showed no change in frequency (Fig. 1A). The accumulation of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells in spleens was more apparent in CD11chi DC-ablated mice; CD11chi DC-ablated mice contained fewer IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ Th1 cells in their spleens (Fig. 1B). In addition, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells were detected at a lower frequency in CD11chi DC-ablated mice during JE progression (Fig. 1C), and CD11chi DC-ablated mice had fewer CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in their spleens (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the altered balance of CD4+ Th cell subsets (IL-17+ Th17 and IFN-\u03b3+ Th1 cells) and regulatory CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs may contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, the frequency and total number of infiltrated IL-17+ Th17, IFN-\u03b3+ Th1, and Foxp3+ Treg cells were determined in the CNS at 5 dpi. As expected, IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells were detected at higher levels in CD11chi DC-ablated mice (Fig. 1E and F). However, CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and absolute number of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ Th1 cells in the CNS, which contrasted with the results from the spleen. This discrepancy may be caused by CNS-infiltration of CD4+ Th1 cells from the spleen that is considered reservoir. Therefore, enhanced CNS-infiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. In support of this, vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher proportion of CNS-infiltrated CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells (both frequency and total number) than CD11chi DC-ablated mice (Fig. 1G and H). This imbalance in Th17 and regulatory Treg cells that infiltrated the CNS resulted in a higher ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, compared to that in CD11chi DC-ablated mice (Fig. 1I).",

Monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. Typically, two principle subsets of murine monocytes are identified, based on the expression of lymphocyte antigen 6C (Ly-6C) (20). Inflammatory/classical monocytes are Ly-6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1lo/int, whereas patrolling/non-classical monocytes are Ly-6Clo/intCCR2\u2013CX3CR1hi (20). In a previous study, we showed that CD11chi DC ablation caused abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE progression, contributing to the exacerbation of JE (18). Therefore, we were interested in the changes in CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes, but not CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, during JE progression in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. CD11chi DC ablation increased the proportion of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in spleens during JE progression, whereas CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes decreased in CD11chi DC-ablated mice, compared to those in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, CD11chi DC-ablated mice contained a higher number of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the spleen, but a lower number of splenic CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes (Fig. 3B). In line with the data from the spleen, CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and total number of CNS-infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, but fewer CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in the brain (Fig. 3C and D). This contrast in the accumulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleens and brains of CD11chi DC-ablated mice resulted in a markedly increased ratio of Ly-6Chi to Ly-6Clo monocytes (Fig. 3E). This dysregulated accumulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleen and brain may contribute to the exacerbated progression of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice.",

It is unclear whether this imbalanced infiltration of Th17/Treg cells and Ly-6Chi/Ly-6Clo monocytes was directly caused by CD11chi DC ablation, or whether CD11chi DC ablation induced an imbalance in Th17/Treg cells and Ly-6Chi/Ly-6Clo monocytes through secondary pathologic pathways in exacerbated JE progression. However, theoretically, it is conceivable that enhanced infiltration of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 and inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in the CNS facilitates JE progression (1826). Our data supports this, suggesting that CD11chi DC ablation can exacerbate JE progression by promoting an imbalance in the infiltration of IL-17+Th17 to Foxp3+ Treg cells and Ly-6Chi to Ly-6Clo monocytes in the CNS. Furthermore, CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes likely differentiate into CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes and become tissue-resident macrophages at the late stage in inflammatory disease (15). Thus, the ablation of CD11chi DCs, which share precursors with cells in the monocyte-macrophage lineage, might affect the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in inflamed tissues. Our previous study showed that CD11chi DC ablation resulted in under-differentiated phenotypes of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes during JE progression (18). Similarly, the present results indicate additional regulation of CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocyte differentiation in response to CD11chi DC ablation, resulting in decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2) that limits excess inflammation. This inappropriate differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice may fail to regulate JE progression. Collectively, data in this study suggest that CD11chi DC ablation induced an imbalance in IL-17+ Th17 and Foxp3+ Treg cells and abnormally differentiated CD11b+Ly-6Chi to Ly-6Clo monocytes during JE progression, thereby facilitating JE progression.",
