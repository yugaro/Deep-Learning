Given its primary objective of being a research preparedness exercise, data verification audits were not exhaustively performed, and small numbers in some regions may lead to unstable proportions during comparisons. The patients that were enrolled in the study may not be representative of all critically ill patients with SARI, based on the period of data collected and location of participating hospitals. Second is the lack of a formal denominator to assess the impact of SARI on hospital-level or population-level burden of disease, or to generate estimates of disease incidence. Capturing hospital-wide activity requires substantially larger research resources at participating institutions, and there is variation as to the screening processes present at participating institutions. Third, integrating alternate patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life or functional status on discharge23 24 would provide valuable data; however, this data collection is beyond the scope of this work and will be further integrated as programmes continue to scale. Given the mostly unfunded nature of this work at the site level, these expansions can only occur with established operational support.

While severity of illness and age are associated with mortality, we have also highlighted substantial variability in pathogens, management strategies and clinical outcomes according to global regions. This emphasises the importance of collecting a globally applicable severity of illness score at admission for adults and children in order to perform valid international comparative studies of patients with SARI and for future outbreak severity assessments. Future work in documenting SARI care and outcomes around the world requires ongoing, standardized prospective data collection in varied regions, particularly among children and other vulnerable populations.",
