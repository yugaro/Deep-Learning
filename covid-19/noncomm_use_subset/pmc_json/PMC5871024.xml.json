VI, the gold standard in FeLV infection diagnosis, is not readily available to private practitioners; furthermore, the test is laborious with long turnaround times. Increasingly, sensitive molecular assays (RT-qPCR and qPCR) are viewed as practical alternatives to antigen and VI testing.3,9,11,12 RT-qPCR assays detect viral RNA, which correlates well with viraemia and progressive infection,9 whereas qPCR assays detect proviral DNA that has integrated into the genome of infected cells.11,13 Both progressively and regressively infected cats harbour proviral DNA, but quantitative assays can assist in distinguishing between these populations.3 Molecular assays have been recommended for the detection of FeLV-exposed cats, to investigate obscure clinical cases and to screen potential blood-donor cats.3,9\u201312 However, RT-qPCR and qPCR assays are currently restricted to commercial diagnostic laboratories owing to their requirement for sophisticated instruments and skilled technicians.

One iiPCR system, the portable POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer (GeneReach USA), is commercially available. This device is equipped with a simple heating source to establish natural thermal convection in a capillary tube. A hydrolysis probe (eg, a TaqMan probe) generates optical signals that are converted to S/N ratios (signalafter/signalbefore) and automatically reported as positive/negative results on a digital screen by a data-processing module. Accumulated evidence is available to support the assertion that the clinical performance of the POCKIT system is comparable to that of various laboratory qPCR or nested PCR assays for a number of veterinary-significant pathogens, including feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, equine influenza virus H3N8 subtype, classical swine fever virus and blue tongue virus.18\u201323",

Three retrospective and one prospective VI-negative samples tested at VDS-UG were positive by both the taco mini/RT-iiPCR and QIAamp DNA Mini/qPCR systems (Ct = 20, 20, 29, 27, respectively), and were p27 antigen positive on ELISA. In the VDS-UG laboratory and other diagnostic laboratories,27 low qPCR Ct values are consistent with viraemia. Additionally, in the VDS-UG laboratory, provirus-positive samples that are antigenaemic have a high probability of viraemia (data not shown). As all four samples were both provirus and p27 antigen positive, it is likely that the VI results are false negative. Although very sensitive, VI is still dependent on the successful recovery of live virus from blood samples, which may fail owing to non-viable virus or undetectable viral loads. Results from a fourth retrospective sample that tested negative on VI and p27 antigen ELISA, but positive on RT-iiPCR and qPCR (Ct = 32), suggests that FeLV virions were not actively produced from the proviral DNA; that is, this was a regressive infection. At VDS-UG, one retrospective VI-positive sample was unexpectedly negative by the taco mini/RT-iiPCR system. One possibility may be poor quality or degenerate nucleic acid; RNA is particularly fragile once extracted. Alternatively, the presence of sample inhibitors may have interfered with the reaction, or the viral loads were relatively low which may lead to <100% positive results in repeat tests.",

This interesting finding may reflect the testing of diverse blood fractions in this study. The VDS-UG qPCR screened cells within the buffy coat for proviral DNA, whereas both VI and RT-iiPCR assays tested plasma or serum for whole infectious virions or viral RNA. The detection of proviral DNA at high Ct levels, and the failure to detect viral RNA or infectious virus in plasma or serum suggest that all four cats were regressively infected.4 This might suggest that using the RT-iiPCR to test different blood fractions may assist in distinguishing progressively and regressively infected cats; that is, testing serum for viral RNA and testing buffy coat for both viral RNA and proviral DNA. A positive result on serum would suggest progressive infection. However, in the retrospective study, one cat with a suspected regressive infection tested positive using the RT-iiPCR on plasma or serum, so this may not be absolutely reliable.",

On-site sensitive testing prior to blood transfusion could help reduce unintentional FeLV transmission.28 Timely isolation or removal of a FeLV-infected cat in a multi-cat household, shelter or boarding kennel environment is also important for FeLV infection control. It is increasingly recognised that it may be important to identify all FeLV-exposed cats irrespective of their infection status. In regions where FeLV prevalence is low, identifying all FeLV-exposed cats may be an important step towards FeLV eradication. Although regressively infected cats appear to have a low risk of developing FeLV-related disease,29\u201331 and were previously not believed to pose a significant infection risk to healthy cats,32,33 recent studies have concluded that regressive infections can be reactivated to resume virus replication, shedding and disease.2,34",
