According to statistics, 5327 residents in mainland China were\ninfected with SARS, of which 349 died. Besides, 1755 cases were reported in Hong\nKong, China, of which 300 infected people died. At the same time, 665 cases were\ninfected in Taiwan, China, of which 180 died, and the death rate was about 10.7%. It\nis well known that China is a country with large population. Due to high population\ndensity, high mobility, and poor sanitation in some areas, SARS had spread rapidly.\nAlthough these conditions were conducive to the spread of SARS, the Chinese\ngovernment took a compulsory means to control it. As soon as an infected person was\nidentified, mandatory isolation and free treatment were provided to stop\ntransmission and reduce mortality, which is the key for the infectious disease\ndefense being successful",

According to experts, this is\nprobably the worst flu in the United States in decades, which is comparable to the\n2009 peak of swine flu. According to the statistics of the US Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), 4064 people across the country died from flu and\npneumonia just in the third week of 2018, which is 10% of the mortality rate in the\nsame period in the United States. And the situation is still deteriorating because\nthe death toll is rising. During the swine flu in 2009 and 2010, a total of 60.8\nmillion Americans were infected, 274 000 were hospitalized, and about 12 500 died.\nThe death toll from the ongoing flu may far exceed this number. In the United\nStates, even if the flu outbreak is not so severe, about 12 000 people are expected\nto die. If it is severe, the death toll may reach 56 000, of which 80% are elderly.\nThe main reason for the high infection and deaths due to flu in the United States\nmay be attributed to the nonfeasance of government because took no effective\nmeasures were taken against the spread of the infectious disease.",

At low cost, even without government intervention\n(\u03b1=5,\u03bc=0), the number of infected people will decrease rapidly over\ntime, but the maximum number of infected people will exceed 77%, and it will\ntake a very long period of time (1774 periods) to control the disease. In other\nwords, infectious will fall to zero or everyone is cured after 1774 periods.\nSecond, government intervention has an important impact on the evolution of\ninfectious diseases. If the government implements full subsidy for infectious\ndisease (without considering the impact of data costs under full subsidy), the\nnumber of infected people will drop rapidly and will fall to zero in the eighth\nperiod.
