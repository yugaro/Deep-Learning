            "text": "The Golgi apparatus is an essential cellular membrane organelle at the center of the secretory pathway (Klute et al., 2011). Its basic structure is a stack of flat, closely arranged cisternae. Each mammalian cell contains \u223c100 Golgi stacks, which often line up and laterally link to form a ribbon localized in the perinuclear region (Rambourg et al., 1987; Klumperman, 2011). The primary function of the Golgi is to process membrane and secretory proteins. Cargo proteins synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transferred by COPII vesicles to the cis-Golgi (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013). While traveling across the Golgi stack, they undergo posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis (Goldfischer, 1982). In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), proteins are sorted for delivery to proper destinations, such as endosomes, lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or outside the cell by constitutive or regulated secretion (Marsh and Howell, 2002). Proteins derived from one-third of the human genes travel through the secretory pathway (Pfeffer, 2013), and proper functioning of the Golgi is required for a variety of cellular activities and homeostasis.",

            "text": "The exact mechanism of Golgi stack formation is not fully understood, but the two Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs), GRASP55 and GRASP65, are the only Golgi stacking proteins identified so far (Barr et al., 1997; Shorter et al., 1999; Xiang and Wang, 2010; Zhang and Wang, 2015). GRASP55 and GRASP65 localize at the medial-/trans- and cis-Golgi, respectively, form trans-oligomers through the N-terminal GRASP domain to hold the cisternae together into stacks (Wang et al., 2005), and link Golgi stacks into a ribbon (Puthenveedu et al., 2006). The C-terminal serine-proline\u2013rich domains of GRASP55 and GRASP65 are more divergent, but both are phosphorylated in mitosis to dissociate the protein trans-oligomers and disassemble the Golgi structure. In telophase, Golgi tubules and vesicles are divided equally between daughter cells, where they are reassembled into stacks and ribbons upon dephosphorylation of GRASP proteins (Vielemeyer et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2012). Therefore, GRASPs are essential proteins for maintaining an intact and dynamic Golgi structure (Zhang and Wang, 2015, 2016). In addition to GRASPs, GRASP-interacting proteins such as GM130 and Golgin 45 may also facilitate Golgi stack formation (Lee et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The discovery of the GRASP proteins provides us with a molecular tool to control Golgi stacking and thus to probe the functional significance of Golgi structure formation. We have inhibited Golgi stacking by microinjecting GRASP65 antibodies (Wang et al., 2003, 2008), by depleting both GRASPs in cells via knockdown (Tang et al., 2010; Xiang and Wang, 2010), and by GRASP knockout (KO) (Bekier et al., 2017). These caused accelerated trafficking of several marker proteins, including CD8, Vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein, cathepsin D, and integrins (Wang et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2013; Bekier et al., 2017). Furthermore, GRASP depletion significantly decreased both global N-linked glycosylation and glycan complexity and changed the glycolipid composition at the cell surface (Xiang et al., 2013; Bekier et al., 2017). A plausible explanation is that stacking reduces the accessibility of coat proteins to Golgi membranes, which decreases the rate of vesicle budding and transport but ensures accurate glycosylation and sorting. The Golgi harbors various glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in different subcompartments, but unlike the ER, which contains a high concentration of folding chaperones that retain improperly modified cargoes (Helenius and Aebi, 2001; Hebert and Molinari, 2007; Pearse and Hebert, 2010), the Golgi lacks a rigorous system to control the fidelity of its biosynthetic processes. An ordered structure and a controlled cargo flow through the Golgi are likely required to carry out precise, sequential modifications as cargo proteins pass between cisternae (Zhang and Wang, 2015; Huang and Wang, 2017). In addition, GRASP depletion also caused missorting of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D to the extracellular space (Xiang et al., 2013), suggesting that stacking may ensure that sorting occurs only when cargo molecules reach the TGN. These findings demonstrate that Golgi stack formation is fundamentally important for Golgi function (Zhang and Wang, 2016).",

In addition, Golgi structural defects have been linked to human diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s (Aridor and Balch, 1999; Joshi et al., 2014; Evin, 2015), Huntington\u2019s (Hilditch-Maguire et al., 2000), Parkinson\u2019s (Mizuno et al., 2001), autoimmune diseases (Fritzler et al., 1984; Bizzaro et al., 1999), cancer (Yoshimura et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 1998; Dennis et al., 1999; Diaz-Corrales et al., 2004; Krishnan et al., 2005), viral infections (Ng et al., 2003), and congenital disorders of glycosylation and Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome (Durand and Seta, 2000; Freeze and Ng, 2011). However, the causal relationship between Golgi defects and disease pathogenesis remains largely unexplored. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how Golgi structure disruption affects essential cellular activities and physiology such as cell attachment, migration, and growth.",

As highly glycosylated transmembrane proteins, \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrins are processed by the Golgi and transported to the plasma membrane for their proper functions. When transported through the TGN, \u03b15 integrin undergoes posttranslational cleavage for activation, wherein pro-integrin \u03b15 (\u223c170 kDa) is cleaved by proprotein convertases (PCs) into heavy (\u223c130 kDa) and light (\u223c19 kDa) chains that are linked by a disulfide bond (Paule et al., 2012). Because GRASP depletion accelerates \u03b15-integrin trafficking and processing (Xiang et al., 2013), it is reasonable to expect that it may also affect \u03b15- and \u03b21-integrin glycosylation and sorting as well as cell attachment.",

We observed that, when examined under a phase-contrast microscope, HeLa cells depleted of GRASP65 or both GRASPs spread less well on the dish, and they also formed clusters and appeared to be rounder compared with cells transfected with control or GRASP55 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Figure 1, C and D vs. A and B, and E). To further assess the effect of GRASP depletion on cell adhesion, we detached the cells using EDTA and placed the cells on fibronectin-coated plates. After incubation with serum-free medium at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, the attached cells were counted. Compared with the control, in which 55 \u00b1 4% of cells were attached to the dish, only 38 \u00b1 1% of GRASP55-depleted cells and 31 \u00b1 3% of GRASP65-depleted cells bound to the dish (Figure 1F). When both GRASP55 and GRASP65 were depleted, the percentage of attached cells was further reduced to 22 \u00b1 4% (Figure 1F). This effect was rescued by the exogenous expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GRASP65 or GRASP55, but not GFP alone (Figure 1, G and H). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells in which GRASPs were knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (Supplemental Figure 1) (Bekier et al., 2017). These results demonstrate that Golgi unstacking reduces cell adhesion.",

Both GRASP55 and GRASP65 could be readily depleted by siRNA treatment in this cell line (Figure 2A). Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, fully confluent MDA-MB-231 cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h. A scratch was made in the confluent layer using a 200-\u00b5l pipette tip, and the cells were cultured in complete growth medium for another 20 h to allow the cells to migrate into the wounded region. When examined under a microscope, cells that had been transfected with control siRNA almost completely covered the wound area, while GRASP-depleted cells only covered a portion of the wound region (Figure 2B). Control siRNA-treated cells migrated \u223c39 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm/h, while cells depleted of GRASP55, GRASP65, or both migrated at 33 \u00b1 1, 25 \u00b1 2, and 19 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm/h, respectively, significantly slower than the control cells (Figure 2C). The same wound-healing assay was done with GRASP-KO HeLa cells, and consistent results were obtained (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 2). Cells depleted of GRASP55, GRASP65, or both migrated at 22 \u00b1 2, 16 \u00b1 2, and 15 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm/h, respectively, significantly slower than the 32 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm/h of wild-type (WT) cells (Supplemental Figure 2). This defect was rescued by the expression of GFP-tagged GRASP65 or GRASP55, but not GFP alone (Figure 3, A\u2013C). Interestingly, the level of the cell adhesion molecule \u03b15 integrin appeared to be lower in GRASP-KO cells and was rescued by the expression of GRASP55-GFP and GRASP65-GFP in the corresponding knockout cells (Figure 3C, lanes 6 and 7 vs. lanes 4 and 5).",

In this assay, the same number of cells was seeded in the inserts with serum-free medium, and full growth medium with serum was added in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After a 20 h incubation, cells on the lower side of the membrane were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and imaged. The results showed that the migration rate was significantly reduced by the knockout of GRASP55 or GRASP65, while double deletion of both GRASPs had a more severe effect (Figure 4, A\u2013C). In the control, 184 \u00b1 3 cells migrated to the lower side of the membrane per field of view, while GRASP55, GRASP65, and double-knockout cells had 94 \u00b1 15, 100 \u00b1 15, and 59 \u00b1 28 cells migrate to the bottom side, respectively (Figure 4C). Exogenous expression of GFP-tagged GRASP65 or GRASP55 rescued the migration defect in GRASP-KO cells (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 3). On the basis of the results from the wound-healing and Transwell assays, we conclude that GRASP depletion results in decreased cell migration and invasion.",

Consistent with the results shown in Figure 3C, both \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrins were robustly reduced in GRASP single- or double-knockout cells, suggesting that Golgi unstacking reduces cell adhesion by decreasing the \u03b15\u03b21-integrin level.",

The best-characterized integrin complex in HeLa cells is the \u03b15\u03b21 integrin (Yu et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2016; Hang et al., 2017), which mediates cell adhesion by binding to fibronectin, and this requires proper N-glycosylation of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin (Guo et al., 2002; Isaji et al., 2006). Given the reduced binding of GRASP-depleted cells to fibronectin-coated plates (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1), we further examined the effects of GRASP depletion on the protein level of \u03b15 integrin using two antibodies that recognize the N- or C-terminus of the protein, or the heavy (\u223c130 kDa) or light (\u223c19 kDa) chain of the mature protein, respectively (Figure 5B). Depletion of GRASP proteins by siRNA, or knockout of GRASPs by CRISPR/cas9, both significantly reduced \u03b15\u03b21-integrin protein levels (Figure 5, C and D, and Supplemental Figure 4, A and B), whereas the protein level of other cell surface proteins, such as transferrin receptor (TfR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-R) did not change (Figure 5F, and Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). In contrast to GRASP depletion, disruption of the Golgi structure by nocodazole (Noc) or brefeldin A (BFA) treatment had no effect on the protein level of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin (Supplemental Figure 4C). In addition, disruption of the Golgi ribbon by Golgin 84 depletion had no effect on integrin level (Supplemental Figure 6 in Xiang et al., 2013). These results indicate a unique role of Golgi stacking rather than ribbon linking in regulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration.",

To determine whether GRASP depletion reduces \u03b15-integrin level by inducing ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) or by affecting its maturation, we blocked newly synthesized \u03b15 integrin in the ER by BFA treatment for 2 h and released it for indicated times in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) and MG132 or monensin. MG132 inhibits ERAD, while monensin blocks the trafficking of \u03b15 integrin from the Golgi stack to the TGN and thus inhibits \u03b15-integrin cleavage. In this experiment, we determined the level of the full-length uncleaved form of \u03b15 integrin on reducing gels. As GRASP KO cells have lower integrin levels, we exposed those gels longer, and thus all cell lines had a similar signal at the 0 time point to start with, and the reduction of the protein was assessed over time. As shown in Figure 5G, the decrease of full-length \u03b15 integrin in GRASP-knockout cells was faster than in WT cells. The reduction of full-length \u03b15 integrin could be the end result of one of two processes. One is ERAD; this possibility was ruled out, because the \u03b15-integrin level was not rescued by MG132 (Figure 5G, lane 5 vs. lane 4). The other possibility is that \u03b15 integrin is cleaved by PCs in the TGN to mature; this explanation was supported by the inhibition of the reduction by monensin (Figure 5G, lane 6 vs. lane 4). These results demonstrate that GRASP KO does not cause ERAD of \u03b15 integrin; rather, it accelerates integrin trafficking and maturation, which is consistent with our previous observation in GRASP-\u00addepleted cells (Xiang et al., 2013).",

Reexpression of GRASP in the related GRASP-KO cells not only restored the \u03b15\u03b21-integrin level (Figure 3C) but also the defects in cell attachment (Figure 1, G and H, and Supplemental Figure 1) and migration (Figures 3 and 4 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 3). To determine whether the reduction of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin is the main reason for the decreased cell attachment and migration in GRASP-depleted cells, we exogenously expressed \u03b15 integrin-GFP, which is known to restore the protein level of both \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrins (Isaji et al., 2006, 2009). As expected, expression of \u03b15-GFP, but not GFP alone, increased the protein levels of both \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrins in GRASP single- and double-knockout cells to levels comparable to those of WT cells (Figure 5H). Significantly, restoration of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin level in GRASP-KO cells largely rescued the reduced cell adhesion (Figure 5I) and migration (Supplemental Figure 5) phenotype. These results demonstrate that GRASP depletion decreases cell adhesion and migration via the reduction of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin.",

These proteins were stable, with no significant reduction within 36 h of CHX treatment, and were not affected by GRASP knockdown (Figure 6C) or knockout (Supplemental Figure 6). These results are consistent with previous reports that integrins are stable proteins in the cell (Lobert et al., 2010; Bottcher et al., 2012). To further confirm these results by an alternative approach, we performed the same metabolic labeling and pulse\u2013chase assay as described earlier. HeLa cells transfected with control or GRASP siRNAs were incubated in a medium containing 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine for 1 h; chased for 12, 24, or 48 h; and lysed. Then \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by nonreducing SDS\u2013PAGE and autoradiography. We found that, within 48 h, the degradation rates of both \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin were not significantly affected by GRASP depletion (Figure 6, D\u2013F). Therefore, we conclude that GRASP depletion reduces the synthesis of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin but does not affect their stability.",

Based on the literature, this is the first systematic study that links Golgi structure formation and function with cellular activities, including cell attachment, migration, and growth. It is reasonable to speculate that Golgi fragmentation found in diseases may cause global defects in protein trafficking, glycosylation, and secretion that impact essential cell activities. Thus, studying the cellular activities under Golgi destruction and discovering the factors that drive these changes will help us understand disease pathogenesis. In the long term, molecular tools may be developed to restore normal Golgi structure and function under disease conditions and thus to delay disease development.",

As integrins are key proteins in these cellular activities, we determined the protein level of nine integrins that are known to be expressed in HeLa cells. Among these integrin subunits, \u03b15 and \u03b21, the major and best-characterized integrins in HeLa cells, exhibited the most dramatic reduction in GRASP-KO cells, while other integrins did not change or only modestly decreased. This demonstrates that different integrins are regulated differently in their expression, as previously described (Judware and Culp, 1997; Palomino et al., 2005). We then used two different antibodies and different gel systems to further characterize \u03b15\u03b21 integrin in GRASP-KO cells. We found that both mature integrins and the individual components in the complex were all reduced by GRASP depletion. More importantly, restoration of the \u03b15\u03b21-integrin level in GRASP-KO cells rescued the reduced cell adhesion and migration phenotype. These results indicate that the reduced cell adhesion and migration after GRASP depletion is mostly attributable to the reduced \u03b15\u03b21-integrin expression.",

Given that the Golgi plays a critical role in protein glycosylation and sorting (Zhang and Wang, 2016; Huang and Wang, 2017) and that proper glycosylation of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin is important for its function and activation (Zheng et al., 1994; Guo et al., 2002; Gu and Taniguchi, 2004; Hang et al., 2017), we expected that Golgi structural defects might affect integrin glycosylation, trafficking, and degradation. There are two possible reasons for the reduced \u03b15\u03b21-integrin level in GRASP-depleted cells: one is increased degradation, the other is decreased synthesis. Given that protein glycosylation has been thought to be a key mechanism to help protein folding and maintain protein stability (Live et al., 1996; Shental-Bechor and Levy, 2008; Sola and Griebenow, 2009; Lee et al., 2015), we originally expected that GRASP depletion might affect integrin stability. However, the results demonstrated that GRASP depletion did not trigger integrin degradation by ERAD or its turnover; instead, it reduced \u03b15\u03b21-integrin synthesis, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In addition, GRASP depletion also accelerated \u03b15-integrin trafficking and maturation, which is consistent with our previous findings (Xiang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In contrast to the reduced integrin synthesis, total protein synthesis was increased by GRASP depletion, while some other proteins at the cell surface, such as IGFR and TfR, were unaffected. The observation of increased protein synthesis in this study could also be attributed to the increased demand of the cells for more proteins with increased trafficking and cell growth. It has been demonstrated that, at the onset of mitosis, phosphorylation of GRASPs and golgins by mitotic kinases results in Golgi disassembly, which is required for cell cycle progression (Jesch et al., 2001; Sutterlin et al., 2002; Duran et al., 2008; Xiang and Wang, 2010; Guizzunti and Seemann, 2016), and GRASP depletion accelerates cell cycle progression (Tang et al., 2010). It is conceivable that cells with unstacked Golgi grow faster, as protein synthesis and cargo transport are enhanced. Some signaling pathways may be selectively activated or inhibited to control the synthesis of different proteins. Exploiting the underlying mechanism will be a future direction of this study.",

Briefly, HeLa cells grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 1 h and labeled with 1 ml of medium containing 250 \u00b5Ci/ml Trans 35S-Label [35S] (MP Biomedicals, cat. no. 15100614) for 1 h. After being washed with PBS, cells were collected either immediately on ice or after incubation in 4 ml of complete growth medium containing 2 mM l-cysteine and l-methionine for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 \u00b5M pepstatin A) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, cat. no. 5000006). The cell lysates (2 mg) were immunoprecipitated with 50 ng of the \u03b15-integrin antibody BIIG2 and 60 ng of the \u03b21-integrin antibody P5D2 overnight at 4\u00b0C. The antibodies were precipitated with 30 \u00b5l of protein G beads (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the immunoisolated materials were eluted by boiling for 5 min in nonreducing SDS sample buffer. Integrins were resolved using 6.5% nonreducing SDS\u2013PAGE followed by autoradiography.",
