            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infects cloven-hoofed animals and has had\ndevastating consequences in many countries (Gibbens\net al., 2001; Grubman\net al., 2004; Knowles\net al., 2001). Two strategies for its prevention and\neradication have been widely adopted. Mass slaughter of animals at risk of infection has\nbeen used extensively in developed countries but economic factors have made vaccination\nmore popular in developing countries where the prevalence of FMD is high (Li et al., 2010). Most countries in\nthe European Union and North America have controlled the disease by slaughtering\ninfected animals and those that may have been exposed, but it remains endemic in many\nAfrican, Asian, and South American countries (Bayry\net al., 2001). Although the slaughter policy has been\nhighly successful in limiting the extent of outbreaks and eliminating the infection, it\nhas important negative aspects. Notably, because it is not used in conjunction with\nvaccination, the remaining herds have almost no residual immunity and so remain very\nvulnerable to the disease. New infections can therefore spread rapidly, particularly in\ndensely populated areas (Bayry et al.,\n2001). The vulnerability of nominally FMD-free countries and regions is amply\ndemonstrated by the recent outbreaks in Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, Japan, and\nSouth Korea, among others (Bayry et al.,\n2001; Cottam et al.,\n2006; Ferguson et al., 2001; Muroga et al., 2012; Ryan\net al., 2008; Sakamoto\net al., 2002; Wee\net al., 2004; Woolhouse\net al., 2001; Yoon\net al., 2012;). FMD has been successfully controlled by\nvaccination in many developing countries. However, existing FMDV vaccines have several\ndrawbacks: they are expensive, have a narrow antigenic spectrum, provide only short term\nimmunity, and are very fragile (Belsham et\nal., 2011; Kitching et\nal., 2007).",

            "text": "Alternatives to the slaughter and vaccination strategies for FMD control have been\ninvestigated. These include RNAi-based treatments, in vivo interferon\nexpression technology, the use of synthetic chemical inhibitors, and treatment with\nChinese herbal extracts. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved\nmechanism of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing that is triggered by\ndouble-stranded RNA (dsRNA), including siRNA and miRNA, and has great potential for\ncontrolling viral infections (Du et\nal., 2011). Most studies on the use of RNAi to inhibit FMDV\nreplication have focused exclusively on in vitro experiments using\ncellular models (Chen et al., 2004; Chen\net al., 2006; Du\net al., 2011; Kahana\net al., 2004; Kim\net al., 2008; Luo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008;), but there have\nbeen a few in vivo studies using large animal models such as swine\n(Chen et al., 2004; Chen et\nal., 2006; Luo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008). Interferons\n(IFNs) are the first line of the host's innate immune defenses against viral infection\n(Diaz-San Segundo et al.,\n2010). It has been demonstrated that type I, type II, and type III IFNs\n(IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively) are active against many viruses (Basler et al., 2002; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012). A number of studies have\ninvestigated the ability of interferons to inhibit FMDV replication in vitro, and some\nof these have been extended into susceptible animal models such as guinea pigs, swine,\nand cattle. Vector-mediated interferon expression in vivo successfully\ninhibited FMDV replication and protected FMDV-challenged animals in some cases (Chinsanggaram et al., 2003; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2010;\nMartin et al., 2012; Moraes et al., 2007). The\nbroad-spectrum efficacy of inoculation with combinational interferon-expressing vectors\nas a means of inhibiting FMDV replication in vivo and its ability to\nprotect against FMDV infection in swine suggest that it may be more attractive than RNAi\nas a method of dealing with FMD outbreaks. However, the applicability of\ninterferon-based FMD treatments may be restricted by their somewhat variable and\ninconsistent ability to protect cattle challenged with FMDV, concerns about the health\nof inoculated animals, and the appearance of resistant viral mutants. T-705\n(favipiravir) and ribavirin are synthetic small molecules that inhibit FMDV reproduction\nby targeting a recently-identified pocket of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase. Related\ncompounds such as hypericin that are found in Chinese herbal broad-spectrum inhibitors\nof RNA viral infections have been studied as potential inhibitors of FMDV replication\nin vitro (Durk et\nal., 2010; Furuta et\nal., 2009; Sierra et\nal., 2007; Durk et\nal., 2010; Wang et\nal., 2006). Overall, despite the great potential of methods based\non RNAi, interferons, and synthetic inhibitors of FMDV replication, none of these\ntechnologies have yet been proven to be effective at treating FMD in the field. As such,\nthere is still a need for new and more efficient strategies for combating this\ndisease.",

            "text": "FMDV is the type species of the Aphthovirus genus of the\nPicornaviridase family (Grubman et al.,\n2004). Unlike those of other picornaviruses, the FMDV capsid dissociates into\nseparate pentameric subunits of around 12S each at pH values below 6.5 (Brown et al., 1961). The virus is\ntherefore sensitive to acidic conditions and can be deactivated by exposure to low pH\nenvironments (Bachrach et al.,\n1957). This instability is attributed to a cluster of His residues at the\ninterface between the capsid's VP2 and VP3 subunits, which become protonated under\nacidic conditions, weakening the capsid due to electrostatic repulsion (Curry et al., 1995; Ellard et al., 1999). Acids such as\nperacetic acid and acetic acid effectively kill FMDV in vitro. However,\nin vivo acid treatment only inactivates FMDV rather than killing it,\nand has relatively short-lived effects. Acetic acid bacteria belonging to the genera\nAcetobacter and Gluconacetobacter are among the\nmost effective producers of acetic acid in nature and are used to produce vinegar. If\nanimals and their environments were sprayed with acetic acid bacteria as a protective\nmeasure in the event of an FMD outbreak, the bacteria would reproduce and generate\nacetic acid and other organic acids on an ongoing basis, potentially causing long-term\ninactivation of FMD in the sprayed area. Kombucha, a traditional Chinese drink made by\nfermenting sugared black tea with a symbiotic culture of acetobacter and yeast, is\nwidely consumed throughout the world as a medicinal health-promoting beverage (Greenwalt et al., 2000). The pH of\na typical kombucha batch is between 2.5 and 4.6 (Teoh\net al., 2004), which is sufficiently acidic to inactivate\nFMDV in vitro.",

            "text": "Many broad-spectrum antiviral agents have been isolated from Chinese herbal plants. In\nan attempt to improve the utility of kombucha cultures in the treatment and suppression\nof FMDV in vivo, selected cultures were used to ferment aqueous\nextracts of four Chinese herbs known to produce such agents: licorice (Glycyrrhizae\nRadix), Luohanguo (Siraitia grosvenorii), Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema morifolium) and\ntea (Camellia sinensis). All of these plants are known to produce compounds with\nbroad-spectrum antiviral activity and are widely considered to have beneficial effects\non human health. Moreover, they are consumed extensively in China as edible medicinal\nplants. The primary active compound in licorice is glycyrrhizin, which reportedly shows\nbroad-spectrum anti-viral activity against targets such as HIV, the Hepatitis A, B, and\nC viruses, the Herpesviridae family (VZV, HSV-1, EBS, and CMV), Flaviviruses, and\nviruses responsible for emerging diseases such as SARS (Hoever et al., 2005; Kumada\net al., 2002;). Siraitia grosvenorii is a\nvine belonging to the genus Siraitia Merr, in the family Cucurbitaceae.\nIt is endemic to southern China, where its fruit is known as Luohanguo and it has been\ncultivated for several centuries as a source of food and products used in beverages and\ntraditional Chinese medicine. Notably, its fruit is reported to have beneficial effects\nin the treatment of dry coughs, sore throats, extreme thirst, and constipation. The\nprimary active components of Luohanguo are the mogrosides, a group of terpene glycosides\nthat are estimated to be about 300 times as sweet as sucrose (Kasai et al., 1989). The mogrosides produce a sweet\ntaste in Chinese herbal Kombucha prepared using Luohango extracts and have been approved\nfor use as dietary supplements in Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia\n(Qin et al., 2006).\nChrysanthemum and green tea contain effective antiviral compounds such as chlorogenic\nacid and various polyphenolics, which can inhibit the reproduction of HIV, HBV, and the\ninfluenza virus, among others (Imanishi et\nal., 2002; Nakayama et\nal., 1993; Xu et\nal., 2008). The inhibitory effects of Chinese herbal kombucha\nagainst FMDV in vitro have been investigated in BHK21 cells and\nsuckling mice. At a 1:4 dilution, Chinese herbal Kombucha was not toxic to BHK21 cells\nbut inhibited the growth and reproduction of 1000 TCID50 of FMDV in BHK21\ncells. Similarly, a 1:2 dilution exhibited no toxicity towards 3-day-old suckling mice\nbut effectively killed 1000 LD50 of FMDV (Fu\net al., 2014). This manuscript describes a series of\nexperiments conducted to better characterize the in vivo activity of\nChinese herbal kombucha mixtures against FMDV in swine.",

The successful use\nof Chinese herbal kombucha to suppress an FMD outbreak in the field may indicate that\nthe Chinese herbal extracts it contains have some antiviral activity that prevents FMDV\nreplication in vivo. Based on the difference between the results\nobserved in the experiments with swine and those observed in the field trial using\ncattle, it appears that Chinese herbal kombucha is more effective at preventing FMDV\ninfections in cattle. It is possible that there is only one mechanism by which kombucha\ninhibits FMDV replication in swine but that there are additional such mechanisms\noperating in cattle (Figure 1). Since Chinese\nherbal kombucha is capable of directly inactivating FMDV in vitro, it\nis likely that simply spraying the kombucha mixture on the cattle would provide a first\nline of defense by effectively disinfecting the animals and their environment. Second,\nin the field trial, the kombucha was administered directly onto the cows\u2019 respiratory\nand digestive tracts by spraying it into their mouths and noses. The acetic acid\nbacteria and yeast in the Chinese herbal kombucha may be able to survive in the animal's\ndigestive and respiratory tracts, where they would reproduce and produce organic acids.\nTogether with the Chinese herbal extracts in the kombucha, this production of acids may\ncontribute to the inactivation of FMDV or the suppression of its replication, providing\na second line of defense. Finally, if some quantity of the virus were to enter into the\nanimal's circulatory system, its reproduction could be inhibited by any active\ncomponents of the Chinese herbal kombucha circulating in the animal's blood, thereby\nproviding a third line of defense. The results obtained in this work provide evidence\nfor the existence of the first and third lines of defense. Moreover, the successful\nfield trial provides some support for the existence of the second. The large scale field\ntrial of treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha as a preventative treatment for FMD in\ncattle was conducted in 2011 (see the supplementary material) while the small scale\nexperiments on the use of Chinese herbal kombucha were conducted between 2010 and 2012\non three small farms (see the supplementary material).

            "text": "At present, there are five main strategies used to control FMD: slaughter, vaccination,\nRNAi technology, interferon-based approaches, and methods based on the use of synthetic\ninhibitors of FMDV replication (Diaz-San Segundo\net al., 2010; Du\net al., 2011; Durk\net al., 2010; Basler\net al., 2002; Furuta\net al., 2009; Li\net al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012; Sierra et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006). Spraying with\nChinese herbal kombucha has a number of advantages relative to all of these strategies\n(Figure 1). First, Chinese herbal komubucha\nspraying protects against FMDV infection in several ways as a result of the inhibitory\neffects of organic acids on viral replication and the potential antiviral effects of the\nChinese herbal extracts used in its production. Second, Chinese herbal komubucha\nspraying kills or inhibits FMDV both within the animal and in its environment, and\nin vitro experiments have shown that some microorganisms in the\nkombucha culture (acetic bacteria and yeast) continue reproducing after application,\nproducing acids and killing or inhibiting the reproduction of FMDV. Third, kombucha is\nlikely to have broad spectrum antiviral activity against FMDV because its mechanisms of\ninhibition stem from its organic acid content and various active compounds produced by\nfour different plants. As such, it is unlikely that any FMD mutant would be resistant to\nall of its effects. Fourth, herbal kombucha treatment can be used as a routine\nprotective or preventative measure against FMD infection but is also suitable for use in\nemergencies. At present, only developed countries use large scale slaughter to deal with\nFMD infections. However, in the long term, many developing countries such as China would\nlike to abandon the vaccination approach and instead use slaughter to establish FMD-free\nregions. Spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha represents a non-vaccination strategy\nthat can prevent FMD and could thus be useful for suppressing outbreaks of the disease\nduring the transition from vaccination to slaughter as the preferred strategy. In\nFMD-free countries that do not use vaccination, Chinese herbal kombucha spraying could\nbe used to help control FMD outbreaks and minimize the need for slaughter, especially in\ncountries with high animal feeding densities such as Japan and South Korea. By using\nkombucha spraying in conjunction with slaughter and vaccination, it may be possible to\nestablish large FMD-free regions around the world, significantly increasing global food\nsecurity.",
