Compared to DNS, BAL samples were significantly less polymicrobial (P < .001 for cases and controls), more often negative (P < .001 for cases, P < .01 for controls), and more often returned pure cultures of Pasteurellaceae or M. bovis (P < .001 for cases, P < .02 for controls; Table 2).

Biochemical identification was selected because it is the routine identification method used in private laboratories in Belgium and neighboring countries, for reasons of speed and cost of analysis. The objective of our study was to gain insights into the sampling and culture methods currently used in the field. Also, no selective media to increase Pasteurellaceae isolation rates were used, because doing so currently is not the standard procedure used in private laboratories. Selective media would likely decrease contamination, whereas 1 of the main objectives was to study differences in contamination between DNS and BAL. A final limitation of this study was that, for practical reasons, the returned lavage fluid volume was not determined. Quantification of the target bacteria was not an objective of the study, but differences in the returned volume might potentially have influenced culture results.",

Therefore, in our study, controls were deliberately chosen from farms without recent BRD exposure, and ultrasound examination was used as an additional tool to aid in selecting truly healthy animals. A disadvantage of this approach is the environmental differences (e.g., bedding, herd size, air quality) that exist among herds. To definitively determine whether isolation rates differ between diseased and truly healthy animals in 1 herd, a longitudinal study design would be needed.",

Current understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia in calves suggests overgrowth of Pasteurellaceae in the nasopharynx and tonsils with subsequent colonization of the trachea and lungs.21 Even when applying a transtracheal sampling procedure, in diseased animals, one is probably as likely to isolate bacteria that have descended from the nasopharynx as those originating from the lung. Possible reasons why DNS and BAL samples do not agree are false\u2010negative results caused by polymicrobial overgrowth (sampling technique or presence of resident flora), sampling of a nonaffected lung lobe with the nonendoscopic BAL technique, or the absence of deep bronchitis or alveolitis in case calves. The latter reason was excluded as much as possible by the use of ultrasound examination in this study. Previous work showed that this nonendoscopic BAL approach samples a random lung lobe in nonsedated animals, and not necessarily the most frequently affected cranial lobes.13 This might in part explain why some cultures of cases were negative. However, we doubt this is true, and our hypothesis is that passage through trachea and deep bronchi transfers bacteria deeper into the lung.",

            "text": "Interestingly, in the same animal, the DNS could be polymicrobial, whereas the BAL yielded a pure culture, dominant culture, or even a completely negative result. Additionally, the polymicrobial nature of the DNS did not affect the presence of a negative or pure culture result in the BAL. Also, H. somni could be isolated in pure culture from the lungs of diseased calves, whereas it was overgrown or absent on the nasopharyngeal culture. These observations strongly suggest that, under the conditions of our study, nasopharyngeal contamination of a BAL sample is less common than previously assumed. To what extent a possible cleansing effect of the DNS contributes to a pure culture result in the BAL is unclear. On the other hand, a DNS polymicrobial result did decrease the probability of isolating M. haemolytica s.l. or P. multocida from the BAL, whereas this effect was not observed for M. bovis for which selective media were used. Again, this observation could be explained by BAL placement in a healthy lung lobe in a case calf or because respiratory bacteria are not necessarily involved in every case. Several viruses (e.g., bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus) are capable of inducing pneumonia and marked disease without bacterial superinfection. Unfortunately, in our study, viral analysis in each case was not possible for financial reasons. However, in our opinion, the polymicrobial nature of DNA and BAL is strongly influenced by the sampling (technique and hygiene), given that such a strong herd effect on the sampling results was observed. To overcome the issue of possible nasopharyngeal overgrowth in DNS and BAL samples due to nasopharyngeal passage, both the use of selective media for isolation of Pasteurellaceae (e.g., addition of bacitracin5, 7) and a more quantitative approach to BAL results22 might be suitable. Our study focused on culture results obtained when applying DNS and BAL as in practice. To definitively determine the extent and diagnostic importance of possible overgrowth as a consequence of nasopharyngeal passage, experimental work with intensive strain typing and necropsy to confirm the infective status of the lung will be needed.",

Deep nasopharyngeal swab and BAL were performed only after cleaning the outer nares and without a protective sleeve as used in previous studies.6, 11 This could have increased the risk of contamination by bacteria residing in the nostril. In Belgium, DNS for practical reasons is routinely performed without a protective sleeve, again increasing external validity in this study. Multiple samplers participated in the study, and although all of them received at least 1 training session from the same trainer before the start of the study, variation in the extent of experience in taking DNS or BAL samples and in the hygienic procedures accompanying these techniques might have influenced the results. Deep nasopharyngeal swab samples might be polymicrobial due to the presence of a highly variable nasopharyngeal microflora23 or due to environmental contamination (e.g., touching the muzzle or other objects during sampling). Other reasons might be environmental or aerosolized dust, endotoxin, bedding conditions, and issues with stable ventilation. Likely, the risk of catheter contamination increases when repeated attempts to enter the trachea are needed or when the esophagus is accidently entered. Adequate training is likely the only solution, other than considering other procedures such as protective sleeves, agar plugs, or visualization of the larynx through a low\u2010cost laryngoscope.",

            "text": "In conclusion, a nonendoscopic BAL results in less contaminated (and therefore more easily interpretable samples) compared to DNS under the conditions of this study. It returns an interpretable result in 79.2% of the cases, compared to 31.2% in DNS, and has better isolation rates for H. somni, offering a better return on investment for bacteriological sampling. It can be performed rapidly in a representative number of animals at low cost and likely has less impact on animal welfare then more invasive techniques.",
