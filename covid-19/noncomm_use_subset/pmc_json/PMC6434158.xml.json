The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), under President Moon's government, established new policies to promote healthy living in Korea.12 These policies included \u201cenhancement of customized welfare services by life-cycle phase,\u201d \u201cestablishment of health insurance system centered on people,\u201d and \u201cstrengthening responses to demographic crisis.\u201d The main investment directions of research and development (R&D) for the MOHW in connection with these policies are to promote new and more advanced medical industries, to reinforce public R&D, and to advance human-centered disease research (Fig. 1). Although the growth of the government's total R&D budget is slowing, the R&D budget of the MOHW has steadily increased over the past seven years because of the recognition that health is vital to people's quality of life. The R&D budget of the MOHW is divided by 2 categories which are major R&D budget and general R&D budget. General R&D budget is used for institutional expenses and policy studies and so on. The major R&D budget of the MOHW was USD 435.1 million for 32 projects in 2018.2",

There has also been an increase in the awareness of the importance of health system strengthening as a prerequisite to providing essential medical services during each stage of life.1 To adapt to an ever-changing environment as well as to achieve the correct levels of resource allocation, decision makers should consider using a coherent, disciplined, and comprehensive approach for deciding on an allocation of R&D funds. One way to assess prioritization in health care budget is to match measures of the burden of disease, such as disability adjusted life years (DALYs), along with economic burden and budget prioritization.5 The aim of this study, then, was to investigate whether the MOHW's R&D budget has responded to the burden of diseases in Korea.",

Leaving out the non-disease portion of the budget, the MOHW allocated 35.9% of the remainder of its R&D budget to communicable diseases, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injuries and violence. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the 2018 MOHW fund allocations across the diseases categories. In this figure, R&D funds and the burden of disease in Korea were not correlated. For example, much part of the MOHW R&D funds were allocated to upgrading the national system for responding to communicable diseases, focusing on prevention of variant infectious disease inflow and spread and on-site responses. However, communicable diseases in Korea only accounted for 2.8% of DALYs in 2015.7 Non-communicable diseases, on the other hand, accounted for more than 87% of Korean DALYs but were only allocated 64.1% of the MOHW R&D funds. The most salient findings, though, were in the injuries and violence disease group. There was no MOHW funding whatsoever for this disease group. However, injuries and violence such as self-harm, interpersonal injury, or transport injury accounted for 10.1% of the total 2015 DALYs in the KNBD study, even higher than those of the communicable disease category.6",

Within these groups, only parts of groups had their own R&D budgets. R&D funds for non-communicable disease were sorted into neoplasms, neurological disorders, and mental and behavioral disorders (and ranked in that order). This differs from the pattern of DALYs in the KNBD study. For example, DALYs from musculoskeletal disorders were the highest, followed by cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. However, the allocation of R&D funding for neoplasms was more than nine times that of musculoskeletal disorders. Neurological disorders, which include Alzheimer's dementia, were ranked second after neoplasm in the MOHW R&D funds.",

Furthermore, a previous study showed that the burden of disease from Alzheimer's and other dementias increased significantly between 2007 and 2015.7 Nevertheless, the MOHW R&D budget for non-communicable diseases still favored neoplasms, and the burden of disease as well as other risk factors were not considered. A new process for allocating government\u2019s R&D funding that is based on a comprehensive understanding of the disease burden in the Korean population should be seriously considered.

For example, most of the R&D funds were focused on technology enhancement and industrial service development, which were assigned to non-disease specific budgets in Table 1. When the US allocates federal funds, various factors come into play at multiple levels. These factors can include economic investment models, human judgement, specialized knowledge, experience, and understanding of the R&D processes.315 In Korea, on the other hand, it appears that national values and circumstances are currently at odds, and there is a need to establish a reasonable long-term strategy for R&D allocations. Our study provides an opportunity to consider how this strategy might be established.",

First, we assumed that several projects in areas of the R&D budget, such as \u201cbig data in healthcare\u201d or \u201ccutting edge medical technology development\u201d (which were not associated with specific diseases categories) accounted for the distribution of funds to non-disease specific categories. Because one of the strategic goals of 2018 MOHW R&D is expansion of medical research based on public interest value,10 the amount of the R&D budget for these non-disease specific categories is not small, at roughly USD 275.8 million. However, in order to analyze whether the distribution of the R&D budget is aligned not only with DALYs but also with the economic burden of disease, we focused on three broad categories of disease groups, taken from the GBD project.16 We have tried to provide an opportunity here to reflect on how to identify the core principles that should be involved in allocation in Korea. More research is needed on allocation principles for non-disease specific categories.",

Since 2000, as patterns of disease have become more chronic and diversified, the Korean government's health care policy has been undergoing a transformation, from a previous emphasis on the biomedical model to preventive policies and a more active health management model. At the same time, the expansion of international travel and the corresponding increase in domestic exposure to foreign infectious diseases elevates the importance of having well developed, coordinated systems (e.g., emergency quarantine systems) for preventing the spread of infectious disease. In addition to globalization, rapid environmental changes are also altering patterns of infectious disease in Korea. New infectious diseases are emerging, like avian flu and MERS, which we are able to identify as a result of more advanced diagnostic medical technologies.",
