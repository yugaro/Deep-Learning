The ribosome reads consecutive codons along the messenger RNA (mRNA) until reaching a stop codon, which marks the end of translation. A codon consists of three nucleotides, and thus there are three possible reading frames for a given mRNA. Under some circumstances, the ribosome may move from one frame to another during translation by skipping or rereading a nucleotide of the mRNA, resulting in +1 or \u22121 frameshifting, respectively. Minus-one frameshifting is commonly used to regulate the relative expression levels of two proteins in many viruses and bacteria, where specific mRNA sequences and structures are devised to stimulate frameshifting with a certain efficiency, a process termed programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (1\u20134).",

The pattern minimizes mismatches between the codons and transfer RNA (tRNA) anticodons after shifting (X-XXY-YYZ for the 0 frame and XXX-YYY-Z for the \u22121 frame). The slippery sequence is followed by an RNA structure, which is critical for frameshift stimulation (7). Pseudoknot structures are common stimulators found in many viruses, including coronaviruses, retroviruses and luteoviruses (8,9). The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) instead uses a hairpin as a stimulator at the gag-pol junction (10). Several models have been proposed to explain how various RNA structures function during this process (9,11\u201317). Based on the HIV-1 system, it was suggested that the frameshifting efficiency was correlated with the thermodynamic stability of the hairpins (15). However, by systematically changing the HIV-1 hairpin sequence, a recent study revealed that the frameshifting efficiency correlated with the local stability of the first 3\u20134 base pairs (bp) in the hairpin stem, rather than the overall structure (16). Given that the mRNA entrance site of the prokaryotic ribosome possesses helicase activity (18) and that the ribosome unwinds an mRNA hairpin during translation 3 bp at a time (19,20), the first few base pairs of the stem appear to play a far more important role than the whole RNA hairpin in stimulating frameshifting. However, the situation becomes more complicated when the frameshift-stimulating structure is a pseudoknot that involves tertiary base pair interactions.",

            "text": "From a study using cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the ribosome\u2013mRNA complex that was stalled in the process of \u22121 frameshifting, the mRNA entrance site of the ribosome was shown to be in contact with the RNA pseudoknot, which was modified from the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (11). When the ribosome approaches an mRNA pseudoknot, stem S1/loop L2 of the structure is likely to be the first target for the ribosomal helicase (21) (see Figure 1A for nomenclature). Chemical probing analysis of the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) pseudoknot within a pre-translocation ribosome has revealed a ribosome-dependent protection pattern change of the nucleotides spanning the S1/L2 junction (22). Of several known frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots, including those from BWYV and simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1), stem S1 is G/C-rich and 5\u20136 bp long, and most nucleotides in loop L2 are adenosines appearing in stretches (9,23\u201329) (Supplementary Figure S1). Base triple interactions between stem S1 and the adenosines of loop L2, which span the minor groove of stem S1, are commonly found in these pseudoknots. Frameshifting efficiency was reduced to \u223c10% of the original level when the loop nucleotides of the SRV-1 pseudoknot were replaced by pyrimidines (30). Likewise, the adenosine stretch is absent from a non-frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot derived from the bacteriophage T2 (29,31). The tertiary base pairs involving loop L2 may locally increase the mechanical, as well as thermal, stability of stem S1 and thus provide enhanced resistance to helix unwinding for the ribosomal helicase during the process of frameshifting.",

In this way, Chen et al. used DU177, a pseudoknot derived from the human telomerase RNA (33,34), as a model system to explore how the mechanical stability of pseudoknots affect frameshifting (13). Like the other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots mentioned above, loop L2 of DU177 contains a stretch of adenosines spanning the minor groove of stem S1, where two base triples (A\u2022U*A and C\u2022G*A) are formed (see Figure 1A) (33,35). In addition, three identical major groove base triples (U\u2022A*U) and a Hoogsteen A*U base pair appear in S2/L1 and at the junction of S1/S2, respectively. Mutations that block the formation of some of the base triples result in the decrease of not only the unfolding force (the force required to unfold the structure) but also the frameshifting efficiency (13). Disrupting all five of the base triples results in the DU177 mutant completely losing its capability to stimulate frameshifting, though the mutant still folds into a pseudoknot conformation (36). A recent study using the SRV-1 pseudoknot and its base triple mutants also yielded a similar conclusion (17). However, the correlation in unfolding force versus frameshifting efficiency was not observed when comparisons were made between pseudoknots derived from a variety of viruses of different sizes and folding topology (14). Most of the pseudoknots tended, with various degrees, to fold into alternative structures and this tendency showed a greater correlation with the frameshifting efficiency than unfolding force (14,37). Thus, features other than the overall mechanical stability of a pseudoknot remain to be uncovered to understand the molecular mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting in more detail.",

We used bimolecular pseudoknots to mimic the DU177 pseudoknot conformation (36), such that the mechanical strength of stem S1 (under the influence of loop L2), instead of the whole pseudoknot, could be measured using optical tweezers. We found that the helix unwinding resistance was enhanced additively and sequentially by the major groove base triples, minor groove base triples, and then the adenosine stretch. Single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) (38) experiments further suggested that the adenosine stretch was confined along the minor groove of the helix to prevent it from twisting. Both the helix unwinding resistance and the frameshifting efficiency decreased when the adenosine stretch was mutated. By dissecting the pseudoknot's tertiary base pair interactions, our results provide great insight into the structural dynamics of a \u20131 frameshift stimulator.",

The 0 frame and \u22121 frame stop codons on the constructs correspond to protein products with molecular weights of 37.4 and \u223c100 kDa, respectively. A modified version of DU177, named DU177ps, was constructed by introducing a \u22121 frame stop codon before the BamHI site to generate a smaller product (40.1 kDa) to minimize potential ribosome fall-off during translation. The UUC mutant (UUCps) was modified from DU177ps using site-specific mutagenesis. The mRNA was prepared by transcribing the DNA constructs using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by a 5\u0384-capping reaction using m7G(5\u0384)ppp(5\u0384)G RNA Cap Structure Analog (NEB). In vitro translation was carried out in the reticulocyte lysate system (Ambion).

In the case of hp1 mRNA, various amounts of the specified RNA oligomers were also added for annealing.

Figure 3A shows three typical force-extension curves obtained during the structural unfolding process of the original DU177. The results were generally similar to the previously reported data (13); DU177 can exist in the well-folded native pseudoknot (type I) or in a less stable intermediate that is lacking some of the tertiary base pairs (type II). During the force ramping process, the intermediate structure may first break into the constituent stem-loop hairpin (S1-L1) before being completely opened, as revealed by the two-step transitions in some of the force-extension curves (type III). Thus, the last transition of this type of unfolding pattern mostly corresponded to ripping of the S1-L1 hairpin [see (13) for more information regarding the folding/unfolding of DU177]. Figure 3B (top panel) shows more than 450 unfolding transitions for DU177, and the distribution of unfolding force is plotted in Figure 3C (top panel). The native pseudoknot required an average force of 42.3 pN for unfolding, well above that of all the intermediates (14.8 pN). A bipartite distribution of unfolding force was also observed for the UUC mutant (Figure 3B and C, bottom panels). Compared to DU177, the low-force peak (15.3 pN) was similar, while the high-force peak (39.1 pN) was slightly less by \u223c8%. The minor reduction in pseudoknot unfolding force cannot fully explain the sizeable decrease in frameshifting efficiency (by 62%). Specifically, the three unpaired nucleotides (A167, A168 and A169) in loop L2 contributed modestly to the structural stability but significantly to the frameshift stimulation. In addition, only 16% of the strong stimulator DU177 folded into the native pseudoknot, as opposed to 89% for the weak stimulator UUC mutant (Figure 3C). These observations can be explained by dissecting and investigating the tertiary base pair interactions inside the pseudoknot (see below).",

An ideal approach is to pull directly on stem S1 inside a pseudoknot; however, such an experimental design is technically challenging. Alternatively, we used the isolated S1-L1 hairpin of DU177, named DU177hp1 or hp1 for short, and annealed it with an 18-mer RNA oligomer (ss18) to mimic the pseudoknot conformation with the base-triple-mediated network (Figure 1B). Such bimolecular pseudoknots have been shown to preserve partial frameshift stimulation activity (36), indicating that at least some of the key structural features of a functional pseudoknot are maintained. The hairpin can be pulled directly in the presence of the RNA oligomer. Thus, the bimolecular design provides a convenient platform to assay the mechanical stability of stem S1 within the context of the pseudoknot.",

When hp1 was annealed to ss11, an 11-mer RNA to reform stem S2 in trans (Figure 1B), the unfolding force was increased to 16.9 pN (Figure 4A). The enhanced stability likely resulted from the formation of the three major groove U\u2022A*U base triples and the Hoogsteen A*U base pair at the helix junction. When the RNA oligomer was extended by two adenosines on the 5\u0384 end (ss13) to potentially restore the two minor groove base triples (A\u2022U*A and C\u2022G*A), the unfolding force of the annealed hairpin was greatly increased to 21.0 pN (Figure 4A). The best stabilization of the hairpin was achieved at 22.3 pN, when all the missing nucleotides of loop L2 were added back to the RNA oligomer (ss18; Figure 4A). These results indicate that (i) base triples can be reestablished in the bimolecular mimic and (ii) stem S1 can be stabilized by the loop L2 unpaired adenosine stretch acting in trans. The second point was confirmed by substituting U's for the A's in L2 (ss18U; Figure 1B). With the substitution, the unfolding force of the hairpin decreased by 2.5 pN from 22.3 to 19.8 pN (Figure 4A).",

            "text": "To further probe the interaction between loop L2 and stem S1 of DU177, we applied smFRET to study the conformational dynamics of the hp1/ssRNA bimolecular pseudoknot. The 5\u0384 and 3\u0384 ends of ss18 were labeled with the fluorescent dyes Dy647 and Dy547, respectively. The labeled and annealed bimolecular pseudoknots were immobilized on the surface of a cover slip using a DNA strand complementary to the 5\u0384 extension of hp1 (Figure 5A). FRET measurements were obtained by illuminating the samples with a 532 nm laser. The majority of FRET time traces were rather static (Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting no substantial conformational changes in the hp1/ss18 bimolecular pseudoknot. Figure 6A shows the FRET efficiency distribution from hundreds of molecules, which can be fit to a single Gaussian function centered at 0.65 (Figure 5 includes a summary of all the peak FRET values for better comparison among different constructs). To infer the loop L2 strand conformation in the bimolecular pseudoknot from the measured FRET efficiency, we synthesized a series of complementary ssDNA strands (dna9, dna10, dna12 and dna16) to form various lengths of duplexes with the dye-labeled ss18 (Figure 5B). The FRET efficiencies of these hybrids act as a primary reference to interpret the base pairing status of ss18 in the complex with hp1. As shown in Figures 5B and 6B, the FRET efficiencies of the hybrids decreased from 0.81 to 0.43 when the duplex length was increased from 9 to 16 bp. In this scenario, the conformation of ss18/hp1 (FRET = 0.65) was best approximated by that of ss18/dna12 (FRET = 0.68), in which 12 nt of ss18 were paired. This matches well to the known base-paired state of the native pseudoknot (Figure 1A; the same state is also depicted in Figure 5A for the bimolecular pseudoknot). Thus most, if not all, of the non-canonical base pairs of the DU177 pseudoknot are retained in the bimolecular pseudoknot. This is supported by the previous optical tweezers results, which showed that the unfolding force of hp1 increased in the presence of the trans-acting RNA oligomers (Figure 4A). Moreover, when the 5\u0384 overhang UAAAC of the ss18/dna12 hybrid was replaced by the all-pyrimidine sequence UUUUU (ss18U/dna12), the FRET efficiency increased from 0.68 to 0.77 (Figure 5B), indicating that the UAAAC overhang was dynamically constrained and thus the apparent distance between the two labeled dyes increased. This was probably a result of base stacking of the three consecutive adenosines. A similar FRET change was also observed for hp1 annealed with the same dye-labeled RNA oligomer (0.65 versus 0.79; Figure 5A). Taken together with the previous optical tweezers results, we conclude that the dynamically constrained adenosine stretch in the corresponding loop L2 region contributes significantly to the unwinding resistance of hp1 in the bimolecular pseudoknot.",

As shown in Figure 2B, the frameshifting efficiency increased in a dose-dependent manner, and ss18* was \u223c2-fold as effective as ss18U* at the same concentrations.

This raises the question of whether the major groove base triples also influence the stabilization of stem S1 by the loop L2 strand, which in turn affects the frameshift stimulation. To test this, we constructed an hp1 mutant, hp1-U3C, which lacks the potential to form the three major groove U\u2022A*U base triples in bimolecular pseudoknots (Figure 1B). In smFRET measurements, hp1-U3C/ss18 showed a high FRET value of 0.88\u20130.93 (Figure 5A), greater than that of hp1/ss18 (0.65). This value was even higher than that of the dna9/ss18 hybrid (0.81; Figure 5B), which mimics the conformation of ss18 in a structural framework containing the stem S2 only. Thus, the data indicate that the interaction between the 5\u0384 side of ss18 and the stem of hp1-U3C was completely lost; the three adenosines (A6-A7-A8) of ss18, which otherwise were involved in the Hoogsteen base pair (U*A) and the two minor groove base triples (C\u2022G*A and A\u2022U*A), were released from base pairing. To confirm these results, we used optical tweezers to measure the mechanical stability of hp1-U3C. As shown in Figure 4B, the distributions of unfolding force of hp1-U3C were similar in the absence and presence of ss18, with an average of 12.7 and 12.6 pN, respectively. The lower unfolding force of hp1-U3C (compared to 15.5 pN for hp1) was probably due to the substitution of the weaker U*C for the stronger U*U base pairs in the loop region of the hairpin (45). Thus, all the tertiary base pair interactions, as well as the adenosine-stretch effect in the loop L2 region, occur only after the formation of the three major groove base triples in loop L1.",

Single-molecule data further reveal that the sequence was dynamically constrained along stem S1, resulting in greater resistance of the stem to mechanical unwinding (Figures 4A and 5A). Consequently, we argue that the strengthened unwinding resistance of the stem is a major driving force to induce the ribosome to undergo frameshifting. According to the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of DU177 (33,35), A167 and A168 stack consecutively, point to the minor groove of stem S1, and do not seem to form any hydrogen bonds with surrounding nucleotides (Figure 7A). By contrast, A169 swivels \u223c90\u00b0 away from the A167-A168 stack and locates so close to the G118\u2022C96 base pair that two hydrogen bonds may potentially form, resulting in another putative base triple A169*G118\u2022C96 (Supplementary Figure S4). Such structural features can explain the observed loop dynamic constraint. During translation, when the ribosome is about to unwind the right-handed stem S1 helix, the juxtaposed loop L2 nucleotides will rotate toward the proximal surface of the ribosome (Figure 7B) such that further unwinding/rotation may be blocked at some orientation; the bulky stacked adenines appear to have a better blocking effect. Alternatively, the constrained loop L2 may hinder the local twist of the helix by occupying its minor groove. Either of the two mechanisms can account for the contribution of the loop-enhanced helix unwinding resistance for efficient ribosomal frameshifting.",

This is a convenient approach to mimic and assess the action of ribosomes in a more realistic manner, as opposed to pulling on the whole native pseudoknot. The mechanical resistance of hp1 was enhanced with the annealing of a single-stranded RNA, and the longer the RNA oligomers (from ss11 to ss18), the greater the unfolding force (Figure 4A). The results indicate that the tertiary base pairs between the hairpin and oligomers could be restored sequentially and additively. Viewed from the opening end of the hairpin, the restoration occurred from the distal major groove base triples (three of U\u2022A*U, with ss11) to the minor groove base triples (C\u2022G*A and A\u2022U*A, with ss13), and to the proximal A167-A168-A169 effect (as discussed above, with ss18). Among all three types of tertiary base pair interactions, the distal major groove base triples can exist independently, whereas the other two could not form by themselves: when the major groove base triples were abolished, the stability of the hp1-U3C hairpin did not increase when annealed to the ss18 oligomer (Figure 4B). In other words, the three major groove base triples act as a core for the tertiary base pair interaction network inside the DU177 pseudoknot. Similarly, an NMR study for the murine leukemia virus pseudoknot revealed that formation of the base triple in the major groove of S2/L1 (distal) is responsible for the S1/L2 interactions (proximal) to cause ribosome read-through (46).",

            "text": "By studying a series of specialized RNA pseudoknots having different degrees of rotational freedom, Plant and Dinman proposed that ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by the torsional resistance of the pseudoknots (47). RNA structures, called pseudo-pseudoknots, were made by annealing a complementary DNA strand to bridge the loop and downstream region of a hairpin derived from the L-A virus (47). The bridged region corresponded to a part of S2/L1 of the regular H-type pseudoknot and thus would be analogous to the major groove base triples in DU177. Recently, Dinman and colleagues further demonstrated that a pseudoknot from the human CCR5 mRNA could induce \u223c10% of ribosomal frameshifting in HeLa cells, and the efficiency increased by a few folds when the distal stem S2 region of the pseudoknot was bound by a microRNA (48). These studies further underline the importance of the pseudoknot's distal tertiary base pair interactions in stimulating highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting. By contrast, pseudoknots from retroviruses or luteoviruses, including SRV-1 and BWYV, have a very short, usually 1 or 2 nt, loop L1 across the deep major groove of stem S2, whereas stem S1 and loop L2 are similar to DU177 in size and base composition (8,9,26,49) (see Supplementary Figure S1). The small loop L1 limits the extent of tertiary base pairs in the distal part of the pseudoknot and this may contribute, at least in part, to the relatively low frameshifting efficiencies of \u223c20% for SRV-1 (50,51) and \u223c10% for BWYV (52) as compared to the >50% of DU177 (13,36).",

            "text": "Chen et al. showed that the frameshifting efficiency was positively correlated with pseudoknot mechanical stability, based on the study of a series of DU177 mutants, of which various base triples were disrupted (13). Subsequently, Ritchie et al. found that such a correlation did not exist for another set of RNA pseudoknots derived from different viruses (14). Here, we also observed a weak correlation for the UUC mutant of DU177; the mutation in loop L2 decreased the frameshifting efficiency of UUC by 62%, but its mechanical stability decreased only 8% (Figures 2A and 3C). We reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations in the following manner. In its basic form, a pseudoknot consists of three strands running back and forth. The triplex is held together by stems (binding two strands) and base triples (binding all the three strands) in DU177 and many viral RNA pseudoknots. The force is mainly exerted along the axis of the triplex when pulled by optical tweezers. Disrupting the base triple interactions (as in the experiments by Chen et al.) can have 2-fold outcomes. First, the shearing resistance, and thus the overall mechanical stability, of the triplex is effectively reduced. Second, due to the folding dependence of various tertiary base pair interactions observed in DU177, the loop-enhanced unwinding resistance of stem S1 is attenuated, resulting in a decrease of frameshifting efficiency. These two correlated outcomes in the base triple mutants of DU177 are not necessarily applicable to the loop mutant UUC or to pseudoknots having various sizes and folding topologies (as in the experiments by Ritchie et al.). The sequence change in loop L2 of the UUC mutant would minimally affect the triplex shearing but greatly impact the local helix unwinding, and thus the results did not fit with the prediction of Chen et al. Interestingly, when using optical tweezers, we observed a substantial decrease in the population of the folding intermediates, from 84% in DU177 to 11% in UUC (Figure 3C). This is consistent with the model by Ritchie et al., whereby the frameshifting efficiency correlates with the pseudoknot conformational plasticity, thus having more intermediate structures (14). While the features of conformational plasticity have been extensively discussed (14), our current findings bring to light the following: when a portion of the proximal tertiary base pair interactions (such as the one between the adenosine stretch and stem S1) of the pseudoknot is disrupted by translocating ribosomes, a rearrangement of nucleotide interactions in this region is possible to reestablish a comparable resistance to the ribosome, given that the distal tertiary base pairs (such as the major groove base triples) can still be retained by themselves, as in the case of DU177.",

Firstly, the loop L2 adenosine stretch enhances the unwinding resistance of stem S1, providing the first brake level to the translocating ribosome as soon as it encounters the RNA pseudoknot. The folding of the pseudoknot can be maintained even if the first few base pairs of stem S1 are opened. This is because the distal tertiary base pairs still exist and can act as a core, initiating a conformational rearrangement of the proximal secondary/tertiary structures to reach a thermodynamically stable state. This provides the second brake level and thus a persistent mechanical strength to the ribosome. As discussed above, the second brake level can serve as another suitable molecular explanation to the \u2018pseudoknot conformational plasticity\u2019 (14).",

The structures usually disrupt suddenly and appear as a rip (transition) on the curve, indicated by arrowheads. Type III is featured with multiple back-and-forth small transitions before the rip (inset). (B) The unfolding forces and distance changes from all the transitions for DU177 (top) and the UUC mutant (bottom). The curves show the worm-like chain model for the native pseudoknot from DU177 or UUC, of which an unfolding transition is expected to be located on the curve. (C) Histograms of unfolding forces for DU177 (top) and UUC (bottom). The average force and population percentage (in parentheses) for the low-force peak and high-force peak are shown. See Supplementary Table S1 for more details.",

The first three base pairs of stem S1 and the juxtaposed adenosine stretch in loop L2 are highlighted. A167 and A168 are base-stacked along the minor groove and do not form any hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues. A169 swivels \u223c90\u00b0 away from the stack and may potentially form another base triple with G118\u2022C96 (see Supplementary Figure S4). Secondary and tertiary base pairs in this region are expected to be targeted first by translocating ribosomes. Unwinding of the right-handed stem S1 helix will result in counterclockwise rotation of the whole structure, as viewed from the proximal end and illustrated in (B). Such motion can be hindered, otherwise the loop L2, including the adenosine stretch, may be deformed.",

The three distal major groove base triples of the DU177 pseudoknot act as a core for the formation of other tertiary base pairs, including the loop-enhanced unwinding resistance of stem S1 at the proximal side (closest to translocating ribosomes). When the local conformation or stability of stem S1 is influenced by the ribosome, plasticity of the loop/stem interactions allows a conformational rearrangement in this region to re-establish the mechanical strength, given that the core tertiary base pairs retain. Thus the ribosome will encounter a persistent mechanical resistance during a finite translocating process.",
