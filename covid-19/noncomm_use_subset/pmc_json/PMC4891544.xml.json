During the 6-week admission period, she visited her mother who was hospitalized in the emergency department of the same institution on May 27 and 28, which was the same time that a known MERS-CoV super-spreader patient was treated there.

Her sputum sample was positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. Creactive protein (CRP) was elevated to 1.95 mg/dl and a chest X-ray revealed patchy opacity in both lower lobes, suggesting bronchopneumonia (Fig. 1). A chest X-ray taken 4 days later was improved and CRP had decreased to a value within the normal range (0.15 mg/dl). However, she complained persistently of episodes of dyspnea, sputum, and myalgia without fever. She was provided supportive treatment, but no antiviral agent or steroid because the disease was not progressing. Fetal growth was within normal gestational limits, and she recovered gradually from the myalgia and other symptoms. The results of RT-PCR follow-up tests performed on June 19 and 21 were all negative in sputum samples. The Division of Infectious Diseases confirmed a full recovery, and she moved to the obstetrics ward on June 22 where she was expected to have a normal delivery. However, she began sudden bleeding with abdominal pain on the day after recovery was declared. A pelvic examination with a speculum confirmed the vaginal bleeding. However, the transabdominal ultrasonography did not detect any placental problems or hidden hemorrhaging. Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) was 120\u2013130 bpm with moderate variability. An obstetrician diagnosed placental abruption based on the symptoms and physical examinations. We considered spread of MERS-CoV because her symptom onset was very recent, and delivery would involve a large volume of contagious body fluids. An emergency C-sec under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was scheduled with precautions. The surgery was performed in a designated negative pressure-ventilated isolation operating room. All designated specialized infection control personnel prepared for the surgery and wore enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) (Fig. 2).",

SpO2 was 100% on room air and electrocardiograph results showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and epidural anesthesia was attempted with a 17-gauge Tuohy needle via the median approach at L3\u20134. The epidural space was detected using the loss-of-resistance technique, and a 22-gauge epidural catheter was inserted (Fig. 3). A lumbar puncture was performed with a 25-gauge Whitacre spinal needle at the L4\u20135 interspace, and 6 mg of 0.2% ropivacaine and 20 \u00b5g fentanyl were injected intrathecally. Levobupivacaine (0.25%, 10 ml) was administered through the epidural catheter. The patient was placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt to avoid aortocaval compression. Anesthesia was assessed bilaterally using cold and light touch, and the spinal injection produced a T4 block after 10 min. The C-sec was performed uneventfully without pain or discomfort. The baby was 3.14 kg, with Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min of 9 and 10. Umbilical vein pH was 7.363. A 10 \u00d7 10 cm blood clot was extracted and approximately 20% of the placenta appeared to be abrupted.",

Sudden placental abruption occurred at midnight, and an immediate C-sec was recommended [5]. Our multidisciplinary team had discussed the delivery and had developed emergency scenarios; thus, the C-sec progressed without delay under the regional anesthesia (RA) for several reasons. She was not actively bleeding, and only moderate variability in FHR was detected without deceleration, so we had ample time to perform the CSE. Although the decision-to-deliver interval for general anesthesia (GA) is faster than that for RA [6], RA is preferred to GA because it is safer and causes less maternal and neonatal morbidity than those of GA [67]. The other consideration in this case was spread of the infection. Although her chest X-ray and laboratory results improved, the patient had pneumonia within 2 weeks. We were not convinced that the lung parenchyma had fully recovered, and tracheal intubation/extubation in a patient with MERS could expose the medical staff to a high aerosolized viral load. Thus, the C-sec was performed by an experienced senior anesthesiologist. Potentially high-risk procedures should be performed by experienced medical staff during an infectious disease outbreak period [8].",

No other case reports are available on delivering a baby for a women with MERS, but several cases of labor and delivery in women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been published [1011]. Viral shedding from maternal body secretions, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluid has been reported in SARS cases, suggesting that MERS-CoV could be present in any body fluid and transmitted during C-sec, which is why we treated this patient for confirmed MERS perioperatively. We followed our institution protocol for patients with MERS and referred to the SARS obstetrics guidelines. According to the management guidelines for obstetric patients with SARS [12], all deliveries should be managed in a designated negative-pressure isolation room and by designated personnel with specialized infection control PPE.",

These rooms were connected, but had separate air-conditioning and humidification units with individual atmospheric air inlet and exhaust systems. We used one as the operating theater and the other as a PPE changing room. The air pressure in these rooms was maintained at -4.7 Pa (operating theater) and -1.2 Pa (changing room). An airflow visualization (smoke) test was carried out to ensure negative pressure. Modifications were made to minimize outflow of contaminated air from the MERS-related operating rooms. Airflow in the operating room was > 14 air exchanges per hour. All anesthetic and surgical team staff used enhanced PPE comprised of a N95 mask, surgical cap, double gowns, double gloves, shoe covers, and powered air-purifying respirators. After the patient recovered from anesthesia in the operating room, the patient was transferred back to the ward by the same dedicated anesthesiologist who changed into new PPE to minimize MERS-CoV exposure. An N95 mask was fit on the patient during the transfer and Roberge et al. [14] reported that use of an N95 mask by a healthy women during late pregnancy did not change any physiological or subjective findings compared with those of healthy, non-pregnant women during sedentary activities and exercise for 1 hour. If a pregnant woman is infectious, they may be able to use an N95 mask without complications. Finally, the MERS-designated spaces were all ventilated for 100 min and thoroughly decontaminated after the case. All medical staff involved in the delivery remained healthy.",

Several reports have indicated that maternal acute and chronic respiratory diseases during pregnancy are associated with placental abruption [15]. Acute and chronic respiratory conditions may trigger an inflammatory and hypoxic process at the maternal-fetal interface that may lead to placental abruption. However, placental abruption occurs in only about 1% of pregnancies [15]. Only two case reports are available on pregnant women with MERS who delivered a baby. A woman in Abu Dhabi died after giving birth to a baby by C-sec, and the other case was associated with a stillbirth in Jordan [4]. Thus, we were not convinced that the placental abruption was related with MERS. Our patient was complicated by a history of premature labor, gestational diabetes, and advanced maternal age. However, the pregnancy had a favorable outcome for the mother and baby. The reasons for the good outcome are unclear but may be due to the late stage of gestation and earlier detection of MERS. Long-term follow-ups of infants and mothers are needed to fully define the pregnancy-related risks of MERS infection.",
