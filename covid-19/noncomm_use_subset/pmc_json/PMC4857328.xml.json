On 8 February 2015, the third human H5N6 infection was reported from Yunnan province. However, detailed descriptions of human infection with H5N6 were absent. We herein summarize the preliminary findings of the H5N6 infection case from Yunnan province.",

Neutrophil count exhibited a trend similar to the white blood cell count. Lymphocyte count was consistently lower than normal. Coagulation index detected that D-dimer remained abnormally high, and the platelet count remained normal. Activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were prolonged in the whole process. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that PO2, PCO2, HCO3\u2212, and SO2 levels remained below normal in all test. After testing for blood electrolytes, K+ levels were found to be normal while Na+ levels had persistently decreased. Liver and kidney were dysfunctional, as indicated by the increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen.",
