They differ in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties.6 The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment: carrageenan forms a barrier on the mucosal surface, thereby preventing the interaction between virus and cellular surface. As a result, infection of cells is inhibited. The antiviral effectiveness varies with the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells,7\u201317 as reviewed previously.18\u201320 We already published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of major (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor) and minor group (low-density lipoprotein receptor) human rhinovirus (hRV)21 and influenza virus A replication.22 Furthermore, we demonstrated the broad antiviral efficacy of an iota-carrageenan containing nasal spray against common cold viruses in several randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials.23\u201325 The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9-day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo-treated patients in the intention-to-treat population.26 Carrageenan is contained in medical device nasal sprays that have been approved and marketed in the EU for 10 years for the supportive treatment of common cold/flu-like illnesses caused by viruses.",

The intranasal (i.n.) topical application provides reliable and fast relief from the symptoms of nasal congestion and facilitates breathing during common cold/flu-like illnesses and allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, it facilitates drainage of the secretion during sinusitis and can be used as an adjuvant treatment of mucosal swelling due to otitis media. Additionally, iota-carrageenan can reduce the reproduction and spreading of respiratory viruses. The above described indications frequently involve viral infections which worsen the course of the underlying disesase. Therefore, a nasal spray which combines decongestant and antiviral properties is benefitial for patients when compared to conventional xylometazoline HCl products.",

First, the virus was pre-incubated with the dilution series of test samples and controls for 10 minutes.

An incubation of cells with the same dilution series in the absence of viral infection was performed to monitor a potential toxicity of the treatment. The antiviral activity of the sample dilutions was assessed after 42 (hRV8) or 48 hours (hRV1a) of culture by determining the viability of HeLa cells normalized to toxicity data and non-infected control. With the highest iota-carrageenan dose of 40 \u00b5g/mL, a maximal xylometazoline HCl concentration of 16.7 \u00b5g/mL was obtained, which was well tolerated by the cells.

The three groups comprised three male and three female New Zealand white rabbits. Each animal received repeated i.n. applications of the test item or the control into the left nostril. The untreated right nostril served as negative control. The dosage of both test item groups and the control group was 140 \u00b5L per application, 420 \u00b5L per day (three applications per day). The dosage of the Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% formulation contained 168 \u00b5g iota-carrageenan per application corresponding to 504 \u00b5g daily dose and 70 \u00b5g xylometazoline HCl per application corresponding to 210 \u00b5g daily dose. The dosage of Xylo_0.05% contained the same amount of xylometazoline HCl but no iota-carrageenan. The control comprised the base formulation as described in Table 1. Before each application, the nostrils were observed for signs of irritation or edema or any other reaction, according to a defined classification system (Draize scoring). The nostrils were examined with an otoscope before the beginning of the treatment period and on day 15. The animals were weighed prior to the first application and then a week thereafter. Clinical biochemistry and hematology parameters were determined prior to the first treatment and at the end of the treatment period. At the end of the study, all animals were sacrificed and subjected to a gross necropsy. The wet weight of a set of tissues was taken, and a set of organs/tissues was preserved. A full histopathology was carried out only on nasal cavities (including turbinates, left and right nostrils), brain (including bulbus olfactorius, medulla/pons cerebellar and cerebral cortex) and all organs with macroscopic findings of all study animals. A statistical assessment was performed for each sex by comparing the values of treated with control animals using a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Dunnett\u2019s test. The statistics was performed with GraphPad Prism V.6.01 software or E-Workbook software (p < 0.5). This study was performed in the test facility of BSL BIOSERVICE Scientific Laboratories GmbH (Planegg, Germany) and was conducted in compliance with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) note for guidance on repeated dose toxicity (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/1042/99 corr, July 27, 2000).",

            "text": "Iota-carrageenan is effective against a wide range of viruses, enveloped (herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus9,13,18\u201320,22) and non-enveloped (hRV,21 human papillomavirus10) ones, with a vast number of different viral and cellular receptor molecules involved in the infection process.33 This rules out a specific interaction of iota-carrageenan with viral attachment proteins and demonstrates that its mode of action is unspecific and solely physical. Based on these considerations, we propose that the antiviral activity of carrageenan is based on a two-step-mechanism: first, iota-carrageenan forms a viscous layer at the mucosa, in which virus particles entering the nasal cavity become trapped. Therefore, they cannot infect mucosal cells; primary infection is prevented. Second, newly synthesized virus particles that are excreted from the cells adhere to the carrageenan film as well, resulting in an inhibition of secondary infection. This leads to a significant reduction of viral load in the nasal fluid and hence a reduction of duration of disease.23\u201326 This mechanistic scenario is further supported by permeation experiments as described by Hebar et al34 in which the permeation behavior of methyl anthranoyl-labeled iota-carrageenan on bovine nasal mucosa was evaluated at pH 7.5 (healthy nasal mucosa) and pH 5.5 (infected nasal mucosa). No permeation was observed at both pH values over a period of 3 hours, indicating that carrageenan was still present on the surface as a film. We then wanted to know how long carrageenan stays in the nasal mucosa before it is removed by the mucociliary clearance system. To this end, we performed an adapted saccharin test, which was first described by Andersen et al35 in 1974 to evaluate the time to taste clearance in the presence and absence of 0.18% iota-carrageenan. We conducted a cross-over study in which the nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) time was determined in 5 healthy volunteers (4 females, 1 male; age 32\u201359 years) in a double blinded setup. To this end, two nasal spray formulations containing glycyrrhizin as a taste marker with and without 0.18% iota-carrageenan were prepared and blinded. 140 \u00b5L of test formulation were applied into each nostril; the time of application, the first detection of taste and the time of absence of taste were noted. From these data, NMC mean values (\u00b1 SD) were calculated for both groups. The mean NMC time was 127 (\u00b1 43) minutes in the carrageenan-free group; when carrageenan was present, NMC was extended by 100.78% to 255.8 (\u00b1 163.38) minutes. From these data, we conclude that carrageenan forms a protective layer on the mucosa, which stays for about 4 hours. During this time, the mucosa is protected from viral infection.",
