Several diseases such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, adenocarcinoma, and pneumonia are common diseases that cause pleural effusions, but there is no rapid and accurate diagnostic method for pleural effusion. Conventional diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy is based on pleural fluid cytology, culture of pleural effusions, and pleural biopsy tissue culture, but these methods have very low sensitivity and recognised limitations in clinical use, and they usually require weeks for a positive culture report 1. Therefore, a reliable clinical marker providing simple, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is required for patients with pleural effusion.",

Recently, a local tissue-based RAS has also been described and appears to play a key role in injury/repair responses 2, 3. The expression of RAS components and the elevation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in a number of lung diseases suggest the existence of a pulmonary RAS and that angiotensin II (Ang II) could mediate, at least in part, the response to lung injury. The central role of ACE is to generate Ang II from Ang I. Ang II is a key effector peptide of RAS that causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Ang II can also cause the development of interstitial fibrosis via physiological regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and/or activation 4.",

ACE2 reduces the generation of Ang II by catalysing the conversion of Ang I to Ang1-9 and facilitating hydrolysis of Ang II to Ang1-7. Ang1-7 has been recognised as a potential endogenous inhibitor of the classical RAS cascade 7. Hence, the ACE2-Ang1-7 axis may be an important negative modulator of Ang II bioactivity, counteracting the effects of ACE in determining net tissue Ang II levels. Abnormally elevated ACE combined with decreased ACE2 expression may be involved in fibrotic processes in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism may involve expression and activation of specific MMPs 8. Recently, abnormal pleural MMP levels, e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9, have been reported, and the association between MMPs and development of pleurisy has been investigated 9, 10, 11.",

In inflammatory signalling pathways study, Ang II could stimulate human monocytic U-937 cells to increase MMP-9 expression and activity significantly via activated NF-\u03baB, JNK, and p38 21. The ACE inhibitor, captopril, was administrated to isoprenaline-induced left ventricular fibrosis rats and showed that captopril significantly enhanced the isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis and augmented the isoprenaline-induced MMP-9 expression 22. In addition, ACE2 and Ang 1-7, the regulators in RAS opposed Ang II effect, could affect MMP-9 expression. Overexpression of ACE2 reduces the invasive ability in vitro according to the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 23. Ang 1-7 revealed the anti-migration and anti-invasion effect mediated through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt, P38 and JNK signal pathways to reduce the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 24. According to our results, we conclude that reduction in ACE2 along with induction of MMP-9 activity occurred.

MMPs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including pleural effusions 25, 26. The activity of MMPs within the pleural space may play a role in the formation of pleural effusions by altering the integrity of the mesothelial and endothelial cell layers and by increasing vascular permeability 10, 27. Proteolysis by MMPs may be involved in the formation of pleural effusions by increasing vascular permeability, and thus by facilitating fluid influx into the pleural space 28. Therefore, the presence and enzymatic activities of MMPs have been identified in pleural effusions 15, 25, 29. Previous studies have shown that the expression of MMPs in the pleural space is altered in a variety of inflammatory and malignant diseases, suggesting that certain members of the MMP family may participate in the formation of pleural effusions 10, 15, 29. Tissue damage is a characteristic manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Proteolysis by macrophage-secreted proteases has been implicated in such destructive processes. In this regard, the proteolytic action of MMPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, like many other diseases associated with tissue destruction. Several studies have reported that macrophages and monocytes release MMP-9 in response to tuberculosis or its cellular components 30, 31. Studies have evaluated MMPs in tuberculous pleural effusions and found that the MMP activity in pleural fluid are higher in patients with tuberculosis compared with patients with transudative effusions 10, 32. Our results are in agreement with the above findings, as the MMP-9 activity was highest in tuberculous effusions among the exudates we examined.",

Although increased ACE and MMP-9 could be specifically determined in the tuberculous effusion. There are still few concerns should be addressed using ACE and MMP-9 as biomarker for tuberculosis diagnosis, because (1) elevated ACE levels may also be seen in several other cardiovascular disorders, and (2) MMP-9 is an inflammation-induced target in several cases 33. In the RAS, ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axis has been recently highlighted as the counter balancing arm of the RAS to the ACE/Ang II axis. The regulatory mechanisms focused on the alternating ACE and ACE2 regulation are still lack; therefore, the mechanism of reduced ACE2 found in the pleural effusion of patients with tuberculosis remains to be further explored.",
