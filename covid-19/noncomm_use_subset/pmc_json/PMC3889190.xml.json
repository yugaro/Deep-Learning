Techniques to assess siRNA activity (or \u201cpharmacodynamics\u201d) are dependent on the nature of the molecular target, for example, where siRNA targets mRNA encoding specific enzymes, pharmacodynamics can be assessed by measuring inhibition of enzyme activity. Unfortunately, such assays are highly invasive, preventing time-resolved assessment in the same animals, and it can be very easy for researchers to miss spatially off-target effects. In principle, every target-expressing cell type in the body must be evaluated to assess whether siRNA activity is truly restricted to the intended target. One way to address this limitation on study of pharmacodynamics involves the use of transgenic reporter mice or disease models that ubiquitously or selectively express reporter genes such as GFP or luciferase, to test the ability of siRNA to silence expression at the target site.28,29 However, such systems are not ideal since models generating selective expression of the target reporter gene mRNA in a specific organ will skew the data to give a desired outcome; while ubiquitously expressing \u201cnegative-readout\u201d models suffer from high levels of background from nontarget tissues, giving an intrinsic poor signal-to-noise ratio.",

            "text": "There is therefore a pressing need for an animal model that sensitively and noninvasively reveals successful siRNA delivery without the need for labeling or tissue sampling. We have previously developed an inducible in vitro system using the lac repressor in which siRNA activity results in a positive readout of luciferase expression.30 Based on the well-characterized E. colilac operon,31 in the absence of lactose the lac repressor (lacI) binds as a homotetramer to the lac operators (lacO) located within the promoter region, blocking transcription of the downstream gene (Figure 1a). Lactose (or its synthetic analogue isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)) causes a conformational change in the repressor causing it to vacate the operators allowing RNA polymerases to gain access to the promoter and initiate transcription. When the repressor is removed from the operator, transcription from the lac operon resumes. Introduction of siRNA targeting the lac repressor mRNA will reduce levels of repressor protein allowing expression of a reporter gene, in our case luciferase, downstream of a lacO-containing promoter, thus giving a positive readout of RNAi activity. Scrable et al. independently developed a system in which the bacterial lac expression system was \u201cmammalianized\u201d via appropriate codon usage, to generate a working transgenic mouse model in which luciferase expression was regulated by the lac repressor but could be induced by IPTG administration in the drinking water.32,33,34 Using the Scrable constructs, we have recreated the mouse model here, and in doing so, we have created and tested the first transgenic mouse model in which every cell of the animal can potentially reveal every site of siRNA biological activity. The advantage of this system is it provides noninvasive readouts that allow time-based measurement of body-wide effects of siRNA and therefore provides a platform for comparing and developing siRNA vector systems.",

Whole body imaging showed virtually no luciferase expression in the F1 pups from founders 673, 676, and 677, together with a wild-type control mouse (Figure 2a and Table 1). On dissection, small amounts of expression could be detected in the fallopian tubes and ovaries of mouse 676-5, and the testes and large intestine of mouse 677-3 (data not shown). In contrast, the F1 offspring of founder mouse 424 (individuals 660, 661, and 662) showed extensive luciferase expression (Figure 2a). Expression levels remained undiminished over time with no loss of signal observed after 3 months. Luciferase expression was confirmed as truly ubiquitous following culling and dissection of three individuals, with the organs being reimaged outside of the carcass. Expression appeared to be especially high in the liver, fallopian tubes and ovaries of all three animals (Figure 2b). HDLacOLuc-424 F1 pups were then mated with wild-type C57BL/6J mice and ubiquitous luciferase expression confirmed in the F2 generation (data not shown).",

Overall a broad range of total body-wide luciferase expression ranging from 1.79 \u00d7 105 relative light units (RLU) to 2.15 \u00d7 108 RLU was observed. Total luciferase expression in individuals from the HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 cross was not significantly lower than in HDLacOLuc-424 offspring (Figure 3b). However, some HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 mice such as 1005 and 4001 had very low levels of expression (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table S1).

Given that the HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 and HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-866 mice share the same genetic background for luciferase, the reduction in luciferase expression is likely to be attributable to the increased expression of the lac repressor in the 866 descendant mice (Figure 2c).",

Following the transient transfection of PC-3 cells with pLacIR and various siRNAs, all siLac sequences mediated a substantial reduction in Lac expression (Figure 5a); siLac#3 demonstrated the greatest effect with protein expression undetectable even at the lowest (1 nmol/l) siRNA dose. Cells that received non-Lac targeting siRNA (including siRNA targeting the bacterial version of the repressor) showed no reduction in lac expression. Importantly, siLac#3 had no effect on the level of luciferase expression when codelivered with pHDLacOLuc (Figure 5b), confirming this sequence has no off-target effect on luciferase mRNA. Having identified a potent sequence, a second siRNA containing serum stabilizing modifications (siSTABLE-siLac#3) was synthesized in preparation for in vivo delivery applications. Cotransfection of siSTABLE-siLac#3 with pLacIR reduced repressor expression to levels comparable with the unmodified siLac sequence (Figure 5c); a control siSTABLE sequence having little effect.",

The transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells with HDLacOLuc, GL4.74, and LacIR demonstrated reduced firefly luciferase activity in comparison with cells that received no repressor plasmid (Figure 5d). However, the reduction in luciferase expression was only small since HDLacOLuc was delivered in tenfold excess compared with LacIR to limit transcriptional interference from the \u03b2-actin promoter (driving LacIR) over the weaker HD promoter (driving luciferase) and thus reducing expression in a transient assay35 (data not shown). As expected, the lac repressor\u2013mediated fall in luciferase expression was fully restored on induction with 5 mmol/l IPTG. Importantly, the codelivery of siRNA targeting the repressor (siLac#3 or siSTABLE-Lac#3) also fully restored luciferase expression, while control siRNAs (siHBsAg and siSTABLE-Cont.) had no effect.

As a result, they appear to be more responsive than the animals from the first study possibly as a result of greater repressor protein expression.",

However, significant repression of luciferase expression was observed in the double transgenic progeny mice resulting from a cross with the LacIR-866 line in which lac repressor expression was robust and ubiquitous. Luciferase expression levels within the individual double transgenic mice were stable for over 12 months in some cases, with changes (increased signal) only observed due to hair loss in more elderly mice. Despite the significant degree of luciferase repression in the HDLacOLuc x LacIR mice, only 2 of the 28 individuals examined (1005 and 255) showed levels of luciferase expression that were as low as wild-type or LacIR mice. Consequently, in our hands from these particular matings, the system appeared to be slightly leaky and complete repression was rarely obtained. There is also a high degree of animal-to-animal variability in the luciferase expression in the double transgenics that needs to be addressed before widespread practical application as a test model. Further in-breeding may help to reduce the variability between individuals. We believe the situation of incomplete repression could be improved through the use of additional regulatory factors such as the genetic switch proposed by Deans et al.36 These authors have developed a cassette comprising a short hairpin RNA construct that targets the reporter gene but whose expression is under the control of another repressor (Tet) which in turn is regulated by lac operator sites located within its promoter. Consequently, in the off state, the lac repressor prevents expression of the reporter gene and represses the expression of the Tet repressor. At the same time, expression of the hairpin RNA can occur that further reduces any residual reporter gene expression. Induction can be achieved with IPTG allowing reporter gene expression through the combined release of lac from the operator sites located within the reporter gene promoter and also the promoter of the TetR resulting in TetR expression and repression of the short hairpin RNA expression. With reference to our system, one would envisage that siRNA targeting the LacR would function in the same manner as IPTG (thus giving rise to luciferase expression) but in a system less prone to leakiness.",

No expression was observed when the dose was reduced to 0.3 mg/kg (data not shown). As Lipofectamine 2000 is not a particularly sophisticated in vivo delivery vector, it is likely that more effective vehicles will yield greater responses.

By encoding this system in cancer cell lines, they were able to implant tumor xenografts into nude mice and rats and compare a range of delivery vectors for tumor targeting. They concluded that 2.5 mg siRNA/kg formulated in DODAP-based liposomes (Avanti Polar Lipids) or SNALP-based liposomes26 were the only systems capable of delivery to liver tumors following intravenous injection. While this is a very valuable assay system it cannot provide information regarding activity of the siRNA in the rodent cells (i.e., off target in terms of cellular targeting). This can only be achieved through use of transgenic models in which every cell expresses the reporter system such as the one described here. While our mice would be refractory to developing human tumor xenografts, it would be possible to encode the repressor system into a mouse tumor line that could then provide a model of tumor targeting. Alternatively, we envisage that orthotopic tumor models could be developed where targeting to specific organs or metastases might provide a more realistic model.",

The authors demonstrated that inhibition of blinding choroidal neovascularization from a model of age-related macular degeneration in mice was as effective using control nonspecific siRNA as by administration of siRNA targeting VEGFa or VEGFR1 and that the effects could occur via cell surface toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), its adaptor TRIF and induction of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-12. The use of a positive-readout reporter system would help to address some of these issues of RNAi versus TLR3 activation. For example, injection of a cocktail of siRNA targeting VEGFa or control together with siLacor control into the eyes of our reporter mice given laser-injury induced choroidal neovascularization (a model predictive of efficacy in humans) could help show if suppression of choroidal neovascularization effects were mediated by RNAi where luciferase induction would be observed or by TLR3 where no luciferase signal would be seen.",

(a) In the uninduced state lac repressor (lacI) is transcribed and translated into protein (LacI), which binds lac operators (lacO) located within the promoter and an SV40 intron upstream of the luciferase gene, suppressing reporter gene expression. IPTG alters the conformation of LacI preventing it from binding to lacO, allowing luciferase expression. siRNA specifically targeting lacI mRNA causes repressor protein levels to fall permitting luciferase expression. (b) Plasmid vectors employed in the inducible luciferase expression system. pHDLacOLuc was created by Ryan et al.(34) and contains firefly luciferase from the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) under the control of the HD promoter into which were inserted two synthetic lac operators. pLacIR was created by Cronin et al.(33) and expresses a mammalianized version of the lac repressor driven from a 4.3 kb fragment of the human \u03b2-actin promoter and flanked by segments of the rabbit \u03b2-globin locus.",
