Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) models of inflammation have not reproduced the complex physiology of sepsis and our study focuses mainly on sepsis-related ARDS. So identification of novel and effective therapeutic targets and approaches is vital if the outcomes in ARDS cases are to be improved.",

Following oligomerization of inflammasome components, the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), interacts with the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) through an N-terminal pyrindomain (PYD) domain. The caspase-recruitment domain of ASC then assembles to nucleate the polymerization and filament formation of pro-caspase-1, leading to its self-activation and proinflammatory cytokines release (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18) (6). Inhibitors of cysteine protease caspase-1 have long been sought as a therapeutic tool because mice lacking caspase-1 are resistant to LPS-induced endotoxic shock (7). A previous study conducted by our group observed caspase-1 activation in AMs during the development of ALI/ARDS, and further, that treatment with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor has been shown to reduce LPS-induced lung injury in mice (8). Caspase-1 activation in AM is thus closely related to the occurrence of ALI/ARDS. However, the mechanism modulating caspase-1 activation during pyroptosis remains unclear.",

IRF-1 promotes cell death with caspase-1 activation, which has been associated with oligodendrocyte pyroptosis in multiple sclerosis and encephalomyelitis lomyelitis (10\u201313). While the role of IRF-1 in AMs\u2019 susceptibility to injury is largely unknown. Inflammatory injury to lung tissue of IRF-1-knockout mice is reduced significantly during sepsis (14\u201316). It has been found by our research group that AMs in mice with LPS-induced ALI/ARDS present with activation of caspase-1, which is a characteristic of pyroptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that IRF-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS by regulating alveolar macrophage pyroptosis and the release of inflammatory mediators.",

Here, we set out to determine the role of IRF-1 during LPS-induced ALI in mice, and the association between TLR4 and caspase-1. It has already been established that caspase-1 is a biomarker of pyroptosis. We isolated the AMs from the ALI mouse model. As shown in Figure 1A, western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein levels of TLR4, IRF-1(P <0.05), and caspase-1 increased in AMs after LPS administration. We also found that mRNA expression coding for TLR4 (Fig. 1B, P <0.05), IRF-1 (Fig. 1B, P <0.05), and caspase-1 (Fig. 1B, P <0.05) were significantly higher when compared with the control group, a result that was consistent with our western blot analysis. To determine the levels of caspase-1 in the lung tissue, caspase-1 was detected in lung sections by immunohistochemistry staining. Higher expression levels of caspase-1 were observed in lung tissue from the ALI mouse model (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that LPS does indeed induce TLR4 and IRF-1 expression and pyroptosis in alveolar macrophages in ALI.",

To determine whether IRF-1 contributes to mortality following LPS administration, 96-h survival rates were noted. Significantly, LPS-induced mortality was 100% in the WT mice at 32 h, whereas all IRF-1 KO mice survived for 96 h postadministration (Fig. 2A). IRF-1 KO mice demonstrated significantly improved 96-h survival rates compared with the control WT mice (P <0.05). In a further set of experiments, four animal groups were created: WT/PBS group; WT/LPS group; IRF-1 KO/PBS group; and IRF-1 KO/LPS group. An examination of the pathology of the lung tissue showed that the WT/LPS group developed exacerbated lung inflammation, hemorrhaging and alveolar septal thickening, while lung lesions were fewer in the IRF-1 KO mice (Fig. 2B). The level of total proteins in BALF (Fig. 2C, P <0.05), lung injury score (Fig. 2D, P <0.05), and pulmonary W/D weight ratio (Fig. 2E, P <0.05) significantly reduced in the IRF-1 KO/LPS group when compared with the WT/LPS group, which indicated that the lung injury in IRF-1 KO mice was alleviated. For cytokine levels both in serum and BALF, we discovered that IRF-1 deletion significantly blocked LPS-induced IL-18 (Fig. 3A, P <0.05; Fig. 3B, P <0.05) as well as IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3C, P <0.05; Fig. 3D, P <0.05), and HMGB1 (Fig. 3E, P <0.05; Fig. 3F, P <0.05) compared with the WT/LPS group. These pyroptosis-associated cytokines have been shown to be important mediators of tissue damage. These data indicate that IRF-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI.",

We showed that tissue-derived alveolar macrophages from LPS-stimulated IRF-1 KO mice exhibit less pyroptosis than their WT counterparts (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of IRF-1 in J744.A1 cells alone is a sufficient stimulation to induce pyroptosis. Consequently, our data provides evidence that IRF-1 activation induces pyroptosis by modulating ASC pyroptosome formation and caspase-1 activation (Fig. 7). Indeed, it has been shown that IRF-1 is an essential transcription factor involved in pyroptotic cell death. Previous studies have proved that the caspase-1 gene contains an IRF-1-binding element (IRE), and that caspase-1 expression cannot be up-regulated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells stimulated by IFN without the presence of IRF-1 (22, 23). IRF-1 can also induce the pyroptosis of oligodendrocyte in the development of multiple sclerosis, promote the inflammatory reaction, and lead to inflammatory demyelination (9). The presence of IRE as a gene promoter of caspase-1 makes it possible that IRF-1 directly regulates caspase-1 activity and alveolar macrophage pyroptosis from the structure.",

We also validated that overexpression of IRF-1 serves as a strong promoter of the above-mentioned inflammatory cytokine release (Fig. 8). Currently, caspase-1- mediated tissue damage is thought to require the pro-inflammatory caspase-1 substrates IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, while the existence of another caspase-1-dependent mediator of endotoxemia, HMGB1, has been described. Reduced HMGB1 levels in caspase-1-deficient mice correlated with their resistance to LPS, while the neutralization of HMGB1 with Abs protected mice deficient in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from succumbing to a lethal dose of LPS (7). Furthermore, IRF-1 mediates the release of HMGB1 by post-translational modification through acetylation (15).
