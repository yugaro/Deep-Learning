DENV infection continues to spread globally with an estimated 70 to 100 human million infections, 2.1 million clinically severe cases, and 21,000 deaths per year (1). Following mosquito inoculation, DENV infection in humans can be clinically silent (asymptomatic) or cause syndromes ranging from a febrile illness (classic dengue fever [DF]) to a life-threatening hemorrhage and vascular permeability syndrome (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [DHF/DSS]) (2). Although the pathogenesis of DENV infection remains controversial, antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection in Fc-\u03b3 receptor-bearing cells, effects of virulent strains, a proinflammatory cytokine storm secondary to exuberant activation of poorly lytic cross-reactive T cells, and excessive complement activation have been suggested as possible mechanisms (reviewed in reference 3).",

The mature dengue virion is an ~50-nm particle composed of a nucleocapsid in association with the RNA genome, which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer into which the prM/M and E proteins insert. The E protein has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, at Asn-67 in domain II, which is unique for the DENV complex, and Asn-153 in domain I, which is conserved in most flaviviruses (4). DENV utilizes the N-linked glycan at Asn-67 to interact with the cell surface attachment lectin DC-SIGN to facilitate binding and entry into host cells (5, 6). DENV enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fuses with acidic endosomes, after which the viral genome penetrates into the cytoplasm of target cells (7). Following protein translation and RNA replication, immature virions assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum (7) and pass through the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (8) where virus maturation and cleavage of prM to M protein are promoted by furin-like proteases (9).",

The classical pathway activity is triggered by C1q binding to antigen-antibody complexes on the surfaces of pathogens. The lectin pathway is initiated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin recognition of carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of microbes or apoptotic cells. Binding of MBL (or ficolins) activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). While three MASP proteins have been identified (i.e., MASP-1, -2, and -3), MASP-2 is responsible for cleavage of C4 and C2 to form the C3 convertase C4bC2a (10). MBL has also been shown to induce C3 activation independently of C4 and C2 (the C4 and C2 bypass pathway) (11\u201313). The alternative pathway is constitutively active at low levels through the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and also serves to amplify activation of the classical and lectin pathways. The binding of C3b back to the C3 convertases of the classical and alternative pathways generates the C5 convertases. These enzymes cleave C5 to generate the anaphylatoxin C5a and C5b, which promotes assembly of C5b-9 membrane attack (lytic) complex.",

Human MBL is encoded by the MBL2 gene, and polymorphisms result in highly variable MBL activity in human plasma (15). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (alleles B [codon 54], C [codon 57], and D [codon 52]) are located in exon 1 and affect the structural and functional integrity of the protein (15). Additional SNPs in the promoter (H/L variants at position \u2212550 and X/Y variants at position \u2212221) and 5\u2032 untranslated (P/Q variants at position +4) regions of the MBL2 gene influence the basal level of MBL in serum (15). Low MBL serum levels and variant MBL alleles have been associated with enhanced susceptibility to infection in young children and immunocompromised patients (reviewed in references 16 and 17). In adults, low serum MBL concentrations have been suggested to influence disease progression associated with HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex virus infections (18\u201321).",

            "text": "A previous study showed that serum from wild-type C57BL/6 mice neutralized DENV-2 generated in both C6/36 insect cells and BHK21-15 mammalian cells (25). In that study, ~80% of the neutralizing activity was lost when serum from MBL-A\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 MBL-C\u2212/\u2212 (MBL-A/C\u2212/\u2212) mice was used, suggesting that the lectin pathway contributed to complement-mediated neutralization of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) (25). However, that study did not address whether neutralization of DENV-2 required activation of other complement activation pathways or downstream components. To evaluate this, we pretreated insect cell (C6/36)-derived and mammalian cell (Vero)-derived DENV-2 with na\u00efve sera from the wild type and several congenic mouse strains deficient in different complement components. Analogous to results with insect cell-derived WNV (25), neutralization of both insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 was dependent on MBL and MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2), but not C1q or C5 (Fig. 1A and C). Thus, the classical complement activation pathway and the formation of membrane attack complex were not necessary for neutralization of DENV-2 by serum. Because an absence of both C3 and C4 (C3\u2212/\u2212 \u00d7 C4\u2212/\u2212 double knockout [DKO]) almost abrogated the inhibitory effect of serum, MBL-dependent neutralization of DENV-2 required activation of the complement system; however, deficiencies in either C3 or C4 resulted in only partial loss of neutralization phenotypes. This suggests that DENV-2 neutralization by MBL occurs through both the canonical lectin (C4-dependent) pathway and the C4 and C2 bypass pathways (11\u201313) of complement activation (Fig. 1E).",

However, neutralization of insect cell-derived DENV-2 by na\u00efve wild-type C57BL/6 mouse serum was more efficient than mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 (100% versus 60 to 80% neutralization at 10% serum concentration, respectively; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A to D). This phenotype is likely due to modifications of high-mannose carbohydrate moieties on the structural proteins on the surfaces of DENV-2 virions produced in mammalian cells (26) resulting in less efficient recognition by MBL. To test for direct binding of MBL to DENV-2, we developed a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in which infectious virus was bound to wells of a microtiter plate coated with anti-DENV prM mutant monoclonal antibody (MAb). Purified recombinant MBL bound efficiently to immobilized insect cell-derived DENV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, and as expected, binding was Ca2+ dependent and blocked by soluble mannan (Fig. 2A). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by an absence of signal when an isotype control (anti-hepatitis C virus E2 protein) MAb was used as the capture antibody. We next compared the relative binding of MBL to insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV-2. Equivalent amounts of both viruses, as judged by a DENV E-protein-specific MAb that bound captured virions (Fig. 2C), were interrogated for binding to MBL by ELISA. Notably, purified MBL preferentially bound to insect cell-derived DENV-2 at all concentrations tested (P < 0.05 [Fig. 2B]). The dose-dependent binding of purified MBL to mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 was also Ca2+ dependent and inhibited by soluble mannan.",

Binding of higher-order oligomeric MBL to viruses could cause steric interference between the structural proteins on the virion surface and their cognate ligands, and thus, restrict infection of target cells. To test this, we pretreated insect cell-derived DENV-2 with purified MBL, which forms oligomers similar to native human MBL (27), before addition to a monolayer of BHK21-15 cells. Binding of physiological concentrations of MBL to insect cell-derived DENV-2 in the absence of any other complement components neutralized infection up to 65% (Fig. 2D). Nonetheless, the efficiency of neutralization increased significantly (2- to 6-fold [P < 0.001]) in the presence of other complement components in serum from MBL-A/C\u2212/\u2212 mice, especially at low concentrations of purified MBL (e.g., 0.03 \u00b5g/ml) (Fig. 2E). As expected, soluble mannan competed with binding of purified MBL to DENV and inhibited both complement-independent (Fig. 2D) and complement-dependent (Fig. 2E) neutralization of insect cell-derived DENV-2. In contrast, purified MBL failed to directly neutralize DENV-2 propagated in several mammalian cell types, including Vero cells, primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), and primary human peripheral blood monocytes, or WNV that was produced in insect and mammalian cells, even with concentrations of MBL as high as 30 \u00b5g/ml (~10-fold above the physiological level) (Fig. 2F; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In contrast to human MBL, purified mouse MBL inhibited insect cell-derived DENV-2 poorly without complement activation, although neutralizing activity was greatly enhanced in the presence of other complement components (Fig. S2). In combination with the 2-fold-lower blood levels of MBL in MASP-2\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown), these results begin to explain the lack of neutralizing activity in serum from MASP-2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1A).",

Consistent with results with wild-type mouse serum (Fig. 1B and D), insect cell-derived DENV-2 (Fig. 4A) and mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 (Fig. 4C) were neutralized by human serum. Serum inhibition of DENV-2 infection was MBL dependent, as neutralization was abolished in the presence of soluble mannose. Mannose, a second competitor ligand for MBL, was used instead of mannan, because anti-mannan antibodies are ubiquitously present in human sera (30, 31). MBL-dependent neutralization of mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 by human serum was less effective relative to insect cell-derived DENV-2 (for donor 1, at 10% and 20% serum, P < 0.0001, at 35% serum, P = 0.004; for donor 2, at 10% serum, P = 0.03, at 20% serum, P = 0.04, at 35% serum, P = 0.001). We also noticed that serum from donor 1 neutralized DENV-2 more efficiently than that of donor 2. Blood MBL levels in humans vary considerably (up to 1,000-fold) due to at least five common genetic polymorphisms in the human MBL2 gene (15). We speculated that the inefficient neutralization of DENV-2 by serum from donor 2 was due to a lower serum MBL concentration. Using a commercial ELISA, the concentrations of MBL in sera from donors 1 and 2 were measured as 7,950 and 1,380 ng/ml, respectively. Indeed, reconstitution of serum from donor 2 with purified MBL to the level of donor 1 resulted in neutralization of insect cell-derived DENV-2 to a degree similar to that of serum from donor 1 (Fig. 4B). To our surprise, the addition of even high concentrations (5.4 \u00b5g/ml) of purified MBL to serum from donor 2 did not neutralize mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 (Fig. 4D). However, the addition of increasing percentages of fresh (Fig. 4E) or heat-inactivated (Fig. 4F) serum from donor 1 to serum from donor 2 resulted in neutralization of mammalian cell-derived DENV-2. This result was abolished by soluble mannose, establishing that neutralization of mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 by donor 2 required MBL from the serum from donor 1 in particular (Fig. 4E and F).",

We first measured the concentrations of MBL in these sera (Fig. 5A). MBL levels varied widely, ranging from <2 ng/ml to 8 \u00b5g/ml. We next tested whether native forms of MBL in human serum bound DENV-2. Similar to results with purified human MBL (Fig. 2A and B), MBL in serum bound to immobilized insect cell-derived DENV-2 virions (Fig. 5D). Notably, the degree of binding to DENV-2 reflected the concentrations of MBL in different serum samples (Fig. 5A and D), as a positive correlation was observed (R2 = 0.868 and P < 0.0001 [Fig. 5G]). As expected, MBL concentrations also modulated the efficiency of serum-dependent neutralization of DENV-2; sera from individuals with higher blood MBL levels neutralized virus more effectively than those with lower MBL levels (Fig. 5E). However, weakly neutralizing activity observed in some serum samples also could be due to deficiencies of other complement components, especially C4 whose functional level is influenced by several factors, including the number of copies of the C4A and C4B genes (32). To evaluate this, functional C4 and total complement hemolytic activity (CH50 levels [dose of complement that lyses 50% of a red blood cell suspension]) in sera were measured. In contrast to serum MBL concentrations (Fig. 5A), no significant difference (P > 0.05) in functional C4 (Fig. 5B) and CH50 (Fig. 5C) levels was observed among donors. Importantly, neutralization of DENV-2 by sera from all donors except donors 8 and 11 was antibody independent and MBL specific, as the addition of excess soluble mannose abrogated the neutralizing activities (Fig. 5F). The neutralization of DENV-2 by sera from donors 8 and 11, which later were determined to contain DENV-2 specific IgG (data not shown), was MBL independent, and likely occurred through activation of the classical complement pathway. Additionally, a high level of anti-DENV-2 specific IgG in serum from donor 8 may have interfered with the serum MBL binding to DENV-2 virions, resulting in a relatively low signal in the capture ELISA (Fig. 5D). Overall, a positive correlation was observed between neutralization and serum MBL levels (R2 = 0.662 and P = 0.0002 [Fig. 5H]). Notably, the sera from three individuals (donors 14, 15, and 16) carrying the structural variant MBL alleles (B, C, or D, and thus markedly reduced MBL levels) also had very low neutralizing activities (Table 1). Because mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 was less efficiently inhibited by human serum (Fig. 4A and C), a higher percentage of serum (35%) was used in neutralization assays in the absence (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material) or presence (Fig. S3B) of mannose. Despite a lower level of inhibition, a positive correlation was also present between serum MBL levels and neutralization of mammalian cell-derived DENV-2 (R2 = 0.623 and P = 0.0005 [Fig. S3C]).",

The results of our studies here show that MBL also restricts infection by DENV, a related flavivirus. Human MBL inhibited infection of all DENV serotypes by both complement-dependent and complement-independent mechanisms. MBL-mediated neutralization of DENV, however, was more efficient with virus generated in insect cells compared to virus generated in mammalian cells.

Neutralization of DENV by MBL was dependent on MASP-2, partially dependent on C3, C4, factor D, and factor B, yet independent of C1q and C5. The absence of C3 or C4 alone only partially reduced neutralization, whereas a combined C3 and C4 deficiency nearly abolished serum neutralization. This suggests that direct binding of MBL neutralizes DENV through both the canonical lectin pathway and the C4 and C2 bypass pathways; in the latter, MBL binding directly triggers C3 activation independent of C4 and C2 (11\u201313), resulting in deposition of C4 and C3 on the virion surface. The alternative pathway of complement activation partially contributed to DENV neutralization, presumably via the amplification loop, which leads to greater deposition of C3 on the virion surface (Fig. 1E).",

Subsequent rounds of infection produce virus from human cells. In contrast to that observed with WNV (25), MBL in serum neutralized both insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV, suggesting a role for MBL in controlling both stages of DENV infection. MBL recognizes adjacent equatorial monosaccharide hydroxyl groups that are present on mannose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and fucose, which are commonly found on microorganisms (14). More efficient neutralization of DENV (both insect cell and mammalian cell derived) compared to neutralization of WNV (only insect cell derived) by MBL may be due to the additional N-linked glycan at Asn-67, which confers binding to the attachment factor DC-SIGN (5) and is unique to DENV among flaviviruses. The results of our experiments also established that MBL can bind and neutralize insect cell-derived DENV directly in the absence of further complement activation; this did not occur with mammalian cell-derived DENV.",

However, in our experiments, efficient recognition of insect cell-derived DENV by purified human MBL was sufficient to neutralize the virus of all four serotypes independent of complement activation. As MBL is a multimeric molecule that comprises two to six subunits of a triple helix of three identical 32-kDa polypeptide chains (14), binding of MBL to DENV may impair host cell attachment and/or entry. For example, binding of MBL to the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus, HCV, and HIV in a complement-free system blocked virus attachment to target cells (36, 42, 43). Lack of direct neutralization of mammalian cell-derived DENV and insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived WNV by MBL (despite saturating concentrations [30 \u00b5g/ml]) in the absence of complement suggests that a higher number of MBL-binding sites are available on insect cell-derived DENV, which is sufficient to reach the threshold required for neutralization. In comparison, binding of fewer molecules of MBL (even as low as 30 ng/ml [1,000-fold lower]) could trigger lectin and alternative pathway activation, which deposits C4 and C3 on the virion surface (25), and promotes neutralization. Deposition of C4b and C3b on virions by MBL-dependent lectin pathway activation inhibited WNV infection, in part, by blocking viral fusion (25), possibly by interfering with the requisite pH-dependent structural rearrangements.",

Genetic variation in the MBL2 gene results in up to 30% of the human population having low blood MBL levels (<500 ng/ml), which has been linked with an increased risk and severity of several infectious diseases (reviewed in references 17 and 44). Our in vitro results with DENV are consistent with this observation and provide a mechanism for why this occurs. The concept that levels of complement proteins could impact DENV severity is not new, as it was raised in seminal studies showing lower levels of C4 and C3 in patients with DHF/DSS (23). Complement genetics (including MBL variation) and the susceptibility of DENV infection have also been examined. While one study observed an increased risk of DENV-induced thrombocytopenia with wild-type but not low-producer MBL genotypes (45), another found no effect of MBL variation on the risk of severe dengue infection (46). However, the vast majority of patients from these studies were experiencing secondary dengue infection, when cross-reactive complement-fixing antibodies are present. MBL opsonization could protect against primary DENV infection (when anti-DENV antibodies are absent or at low levels) yet be overshadowed during secondary DENV infection when antibody-mediated classical pathway-dependent complement activation occurs. At present, it is poorly understood why the majority (up to almost 90% in some studies) of primary DENV infections are asymptomatic (47\u201349). Prospective cohort studies in children with preillness and acute plasma samples will be required to assess how a relative MBL deficiency impacts the severity of a primary DENV infection.",

Differential binding and neutralization of diverse HCV genotypes by MBL have also been observed (36). Among the DENV serotypes, DENV-4 is the most antigenically distinct (50). As the recognition of targets by MBL relies on surface-exposed carbohydrates, the extent of N-linked glycosylation and the spatial arrangement of glycans could influence susceptibility to MBL recognition and neutralization. Alternatively, differential maturation among DENV serotypes could affect retention and display of the prM glycoprotein on the virion and impact MBL binding and neutralization. Studies with different DENV serotypes produced in cells that overexpress furin are planned to address how maturation impacts MBL-dependent neutralization.",

Whereas reconstitution of serum from donor 2 with purified MBL restored neutralization of insect cell-derived DENV-2, addition of even higher concentrations of purified MBL to serum from donor 2 failed to inhibit mammalian cell-derived DENV-2, yet complementation with low concentrations of serum from donor 1 did. Although additional studies are warranted, purified human MBL may interact with downstream complement proteins (e.g., MASP-2) in the serum from donor 2, albeit with lower affinity compared to the native MBL from donor 1. As another example, we also observed differential neutralizing capacity of sera from individuals (donors 3, 7, and 12 or donors 6, 10, and 13) with similar plasma MBL levels and no difference in C4 levels and CH50 activity. In contrast to wild-type MBL, which comprises a mixture of higher-order 200- to 700-kDa oligomers, some MBL point mutation variants preferentially form low-molecular-mass (120- to 130-kDa) complexes in circulation; these complexes do not bind well to mannan and activate the lectin pathway less efficiently (15). Variability in the oligomeric state of circulating MBL among individuals independently could contribute to differences in relative neutralization in the setting of similar MBL levels. Ficolin is another pattern recognition molecule of the lectin pathway whose blood levels vary among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms (51). As serum MASPs also associate with ficolins (10), variation in ficolin levels could differentially sequester MASPs and explain some of the discordant results.",
