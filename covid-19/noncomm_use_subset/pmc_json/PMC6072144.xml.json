In regions such as Europe and the United States, prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy; the mortality rate has exceeded lung cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer has gradually increased with the arrival of China's aging population and the extension of life and diet changes (1). It is also known that prostate cancer-associated fatalities frequently occur in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although several novel drugs for castration-resistant prostate cancer have been approved, each of these has prolonged survival by just a few months. Therefore, novel treatments of prostate cancer are required to extend life expectancy even further.",

            "text": "Currently, immunotherapy has been reported to be an effective treatment for cancer patients (2). Several strategies, including cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been investigated in clinical studies for cancer patients (3\u20135). However, T cell immunotherapy of prostate cancer is still at an early stage of clinical development. It has been reported that several molecules are potent T cell checkpoint inhibitors which reverse immunologic tolerance in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer (6). Therefore, the molecules which serve crucial roles in T cell activity during prostate cancer may be useful for the treatment of this disease. CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) is a chemokine, which regulates the host's response to inflammation by recruiting leukocytes to the inflammatory environment. Chemokines serve important roles in immune responses of the body. Chemokines are expressed by almost all monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer (NK) cells but are expressed to a lesser degree by macrophages, B cells and T cells (7\u20139). It has been reported that the absence of CXCL9 affects leukocyte migration and tissue infiltration (10). As CXCL9 has the ability to interact with a variety of ligands, it serves a certain biological role in the inflammatory response. In addition, inflammation is closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors (11,12). The present study aimed to investigate the effect of CXCL9 on T cells in prostate cancer.",

At 24 weeks, CXCL9-overexpressed mice exhibited a clear pathology of prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1A).

The results showed a reduction in the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice compared with C57+DMAB mice (Fig. 2A) (Q4 quadrant). The infiltration number of T cells in tumor tissues was also examined in CXCL9+DMAB mice and C57+DMAB mice. The results suggested that high expression of CXCL9 significantly inhibited T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 2B). Based on the above findings, it was hypothesized that CXCL9 may regulate the progression of prostate cancer either directly or indirectly by influencing the number of T cells infiltrated in immune organs and the tumor microenvironment.",

Many chemokines may have inhibitory effects on the tumor, and certain chemokines may promote tumor progression (17). Several chemokines, including CXCL4 and CXCL10, have been used in translational medicine (18). In a previous study, an association between CXCL9 and cancer was demonstrated; however, the effect of CXCL9 in prostate cancer has not been reported. A previous studies revealed that CXCL9 is highly expressed in human digestive organs, such as gastrointestinal organs, however the expression of CXCL9 in developmental organs has not been studied (19). In the present study, CXCL9-overexpressed mice and C57 mice were selected for investigation. Chemical induction was used to induce prostate cancer in the mice, and it was demonstrated that CXCL9 may serve an important role in promoting tumorigenesis. In addition, the effect of inhibition or knockdown of the CXCL9 gene in tumorigenesis is important to fully illustrate the effect of CXCL9. However, a limitation of the present study was that these experiments were not performed due to the difficulty of gene knock-out mouse construction; however, this will be investigated in further studies.",

The results suggested that the T cells in the spleen were significantly reduced in CXCL9+DMAB mice. A previous study reported that CXCL9 regulates the homing of lymphocyte thymus and affects T cell maturation (20). In the tumor mouse model, the function of CXCL9 in regulating T cell maturation and reducing the number of T cells requires further investigation. IL-6 is produced by activated T cells and has anti-tumor effects. The anti-tumor biological activity of IL-6 primarily includes: (i) Promoting the proliferation and killing activity of NK, and promoting NK cells to secrete interferon and express the IL-1 receptor agonist chain; (ii) inducing lymphocyte-activated killer cells, which may dissolve a variety of tumor cells (21,22). The present study demonstrated a reduction in the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen in CXCL9+DMAB mice compared with C57+DMAB mice.",

A mouse model where the RIP promoter may be controlled has been obtained from the hybridization of RIP-Tag2 model mice and LMCV mice. It has been demonstrated that CD8-positive T cells serve an important role in inhibiting tumor growth (26). The present study concluded that T cells and expression levels of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 were reduced by increased levels of CXCL9, resulting in enhanced growth of tumors in hybrid mice.
