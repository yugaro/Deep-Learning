Whenever facing an outbreak, there is always a need for health education programs to raise the public awareness with regular evaluation of the level of knowledge to fill gaps of deficient or lack of information. MERS-CoV is a good case in point that constituted a real panic to populations. Preparing population adequately for this threat involves action on many fronts, including enhancing the public awareness toward the basic knowledge about the disease that is one key pillar of an enhanced outbreak investigation, response, and control system. We argue that our thinking should converge on the public awareness and we should address the gaps of all disciplines of the disease. The initial public health response to the MERS-CoV have been poorly calibrated owing to early estimates of the case fatality rate.14 What was initially thought to be a potential threat and severe novel coronavirus turned out to be no more severe than an average respiratory infection.15,16 The current study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and awareness of the Saudi and non-Saudi-Arabian pilgrims regarding the MERS-CoV.",

The sample size was calculated using RASOFT online freely available program (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html) with 99% confidence level. A total number of 2120 participants including 736 Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (1384; 909 males and 475 females) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The numbers and the percentages of the different variables were estimated using descriptive analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient and chi-square test were used to evaluate variables and determine the possible correlations.

Correct answers were expressed in considerable high percentages of the participants. Meanwhile, non-Saudi pilgrims showed a lower level of knowledge for the same questions. In contrast, both groups showed a low level of knowledge regarding the seasonal nature of the disease. High level of awareness among Saudi populations and medical students have previously detected and found consistent with our results.10,18 In comparison to the previous studies, our study demonstrates that the Saudi and Arabian non-Saudi pilgrims showed more awareness of the disease than French and Australian Pilgrims did.19,20",

This finding agrees with that recorded previously in Saudi Arabia.17 Raw camel milk and cooked camel meat are commonly consumed in the Arab Gulf area. There is a raised concern about the risk of consumption of raw camel products as a potential source of MERS-CoV infection.21 It was found that both Saudi Arabian and non-Saudi Arabian participants showed unsatisfactory awareness about this important matter. Pilgrims who were aware of MERS-CoV animal sources were also found oriented about risks from consuming non-heat treated camel products compared with those who were unaware. This finding agrees with the results reported previously in Tashani et al. 2014.19",
