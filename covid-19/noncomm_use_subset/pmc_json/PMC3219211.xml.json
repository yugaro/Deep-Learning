            "text": "Protein degradation by the proteasome, a multicatalytic proteinase complex, is at the\n        centre of the UPS pathway (Fig. 1), and its\n        pharmacological inhibition was originally considered lethal for all cell types. It was\n        therefore rather surprising that bortezomib (Velcade) was approved as treatment for multiple\n        myeloma in 2003 (Ref. 16). Since then, bortezomib\n        has also been approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (Ref. 17). More recently, other derivatives have been developed that are at\n        various stages of clinical trials, such as carfizomib (Phase III against relapsed multiple\n        myeloma), MLN9708 (Phase I), CEP18770 (Phase I) and the natural product NPI-0052 (Phase I)\n        (Ref. 3) (Fig.\n        1). Ubistatins were also discovered to inhibit proteasomal proteolysis by interfering\n        with the recognition of polyubiquitin chains by the proteasome (Ref. 18). In addition to NPI-0052, further natural products with potential\n        anticancer properties have been characterised to interfere with proteasomal proteolysis\n        (reviewed in Ref. 19), such as celastrol (Ref.\n          20), catechin(\u2212), the component of\n        green tea (Ref. 21), disulfiram in combination with\n        copper (Ref. 22), a triterpenoid inhibitor (Ref.\n          23), curcumin (Ref. 24) and JBIR-22, which inhibits homodimer formation of proteasome\n        assembly factor 3 (Ref. 25). Many of these natural\n        products have intrinsic antitumour properties, although it is not clear whether this is\n        solely attributable to their proteasome inhibitory capacities. For instance, statins have\n        pleiotropic effects and are used to treat a variety of different diseases, including\n        prevention of cardiovascular events, although it is not entirely clear whether this is due\n        to direct or indirect interference with proteasomal proteolysis (Ref. 26). As expected, proteasome inhibition causes side effects such as\n        peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, nausea, hypersensibility and increased\n        susceptibility to infection (Ref. 27). One problem\n        with proteasome inhibitors is the emergence of resistance; however, the combination of\n        several proteasome inhibitors that exert complementary specificities appears to overcome the\n        problem of resistance and might have the added benefit of enabling reduced dosing of the\n        individual drugs (Refs 28, 29). An alternative way of circumventing the general toxicity of these\n        compounds is to develop inhibitors selective for immunoproteasomes (Refs 30, 31).\n        Immunoproteasomes are predominantly expressed in B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, dendritic\n        cells and other cell types of the haematopoietic lineage, and can be induced by cell\n        exposure to interferon-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor -\u03b1. This leads to an\n        exchange of the catalytic \u03b2-subunits, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and\n        preserving cell viability during inflammation-induced oxidative stress (Refs 32, 33). Based\n        on the observation that the immunoproteasome promotes enhanced antigen processing and\n        presentation, it is predicted that immunoproteasome inhibitors may have immunomodulatory\n        effects, such as attenuating autoimmune-related pathologies. Indeed, a selective\n        immunoproteasome inhibitor PR957 was shown to prevent experimental colitis (Ref. 34) and interfere with arthritis in a mouse model (Ref.\n          35). This strategy appears to be less toxic and\n        particularly promising for treating autoimmune disorders, and might be extended to targeting\n        the thymoproteasome, a subform expressed in the thymus (Ref. 36).",

            "text": "USP7, also known as Herpes virus associated USP (HAUSP), is critical in cancer\n          progression because of its destabilising effect on the tumour suppressor p53 (Refs 8, 42, 43). USP7 preferentially deubiquitylates the E3\n          ligase HDM2 and its binding partner HDMX, resulting in the destabilisation of p53 and the\n          repression of p53 transactivation activity (Refs 43, 44, 45). Additional substrates of USP7 include claspin, FOXO4 and PTEN (Refs 40, 46,\n            47). Thus USP7 exerts both p53-dependent and\n          p53-independent effects on the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, making USP7 an\n          attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention (Refs 48, 49). Recently, a high-throughput\n          screen identified the small-molecule compound HBX 41,108 as an uncompetitive and\n          reversible inhibitor of USP7 (Figs 1 and 2). HBX 41,108 (Fig.\n            2, compound 1) is a functionalised cyano-indenopyrazine derivative\n          that inhibits several DUBs, including USP7, and stabilises p53 in a nongenotoxic manner,\n          resulting in the induction of apoptosis (Refs 5,\n            50). An independent screen recently identified\n          compound P005091 and analogues such as P045204 and P022077 (Fig. 2, compound 2) as USP7 inhibitors in vitro and in living cells\n          (Refs 51, 59). Proof of concept in cells was demonstrated by the stabilisation of p53 and\n          the induction of p21 by a representative compound from the P005091 series (Ref. 49). ",

            "text": "Prostaglandins are also reported to have inhibitory activity against DUBs in cellular\n          assays. This family of compounds form a group of lipid derivatives that serve as\n          signalling molecules that affect diverse protein functions, depending on their\n          localisation and physiological context. Prostaglandins have been characterised as\n          important messengers in inflammation (Ref. 64)\n          and immune responses (Refs 65, 66), with emerging roles in cancer. The J-series\n          prostaglandins are known to promote apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion (Refs 67, 68).\n          D12-prostaglandin J2 was shown to inhibit ubiquitin isopeptidase activity in cell lysates,\n          owing to the presence of the cross-conjugated \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones in\n          their structure (Fig. 1). Similarly, compounds\n          unrelated to prostaglandins, but also containing cross-conjugated\n          \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones and accessible \u03b2-carbons, also inhibit\n          isopeptidase activity. By contrast, the A-series prostaglandins, which contain a single\n          \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, are less efficacious as ubiquitin isopeptidase\n          inhibitors (Refs 68, 69). Hence, the mechanism of inhibition by J-series prostaglandins is\n          most likely based on the nucleophilic addition of a DUB thiol to the endocyclic\n          \u03b2-carbon of a compound and the electrophilic accessibility of prostaglandin\n          resulting from olefin\u2013ketone conjugation. The inhibitory effect of\n          prostaglandins is exemplified by 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2)\n            (Fig. 2, compound 4), which\n          inhibits the activities of UCHL-3 (Ref. 54) and\n          UCH-L1 (Refs 56, 57) (Fig. 1). 15d-PGJ2 has a\n          detrimental effect on UCH-L1 structure and therefore perturbs its activity, offering\n          possibilities of interfering with progression of Parkinson disease associated with UCH-L1\n          mutations (Ref. 57).",

This series of reactions activates the\n        C-terminus of ubiquitin for a subsequent nucleophilic attack (Ref. 116). Blocking this reaction could therefore be used to inhibit\n        ubiquitin conjugation. In vitro studies suggest that knockdown of E1 ligase results in lower\n        levels of protein ubiquitylation and eventually induces cell death in malignant cells (Ref.\n          117). To identify novel E1 inhibitors, Yang and\n        colleagues screened a library of small compounds and identified\n        4[4-(5-nitro-furan-2-ylmethylene)-3,5-dioxo-pyrazolidin-1-yl]-benzoic acid ethyl ester\n        (PYR-41) as the first cell-permeable E1 inhibitor. PYR-41 efficiently reduces bulk protein\n        ubiquitylation and sumoylation, and prevents degradation of p53, contributing to enhanced\n        apoptosis. PYR-41 also attenuates cytokine-mediated nuclear factor-\u03baB\n        (NF-\u03baB) activation by regulating proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1,\n        an inhibitory subunit of NF-\u03baB. Functionally, PYR-41 probably binds irreversibly to\n        the active-site cysteine in E1 ligase, therefore preventing ubiquitin transfer (Ref. 95). However, this compound also targets several DUBs,\n        including USP5, and crosslinks to kinases and has antitumour activity in animals (Ref. 118). PYZD-4409 (Fig.\n          3, compound 17), another small-molecule inhibitor, has been shown to\n        interfere with the activity of E1 ligase, preferentially inducing tumour cell death in\n        primary acute myeloid leukaemia cells. The effects of PYZD-4409 have also been studied in a\n        mouse model of leukaemia, where it reduced tumour weight and volume. This study underlines\n        the importance of E1 as a potential drug target in leukaemia and possibly other cancers,\n        especially in cases where neoplastic cells are resistant to treatment with proteasome\n        inhibitors such as bortezomib (Ref. 117).\n        Furthermore, two natural products have been identified to inhibit E1, panepophenanthrin\n        isolated from the mushroom Panus rudis (Refs 119, 120) and himeic acid A\n        derived from the fungus Aspergillus sp.

Its conjugation to substrates (neddylation)\n        requires activation by the E1 APPBP1-UBA3 and transfer by the E2 UBC12 (Ref. 124). NEDD8 primarily functions in the regulation of\n        E3 ubiquitin ligases, modifying most members of the cullin family. Cullins are scaffold\n        components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases that control the proteasomal degradation of\n        proteins involved in the cell cycle, transcriptional regulation or signal transduction (Refs\n          124, 125). Neddylation of cullins results in increased ubiquitylation of the SCF\n        substrate proteins and their subsequent proteasomal degradation. SCF E3 ligases promote the\n        ubiquitylation of proteins involved in inflammation and tumourigenesis (Ref. 126), such as HIF-\u03b1 and\n        I\u03baB\u03b1 (Refs 127, 96); therefore, specific inhibition of NEDD8-activating\n        enzymes (E1) and other components of the neddylation pathway represents an alternative\n        approach to targeting the UPS for cancer treatment. MLN4924 (Fig. 3, compound 18) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the\n        NEDD8-activating enzyme and is presently being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials. MLN4924\n        increases the apoptosis of several tumour cell lines and murine tumour xenografts and is\n        considered a promising drug candidate for myeloid leukaemia (Refs 96, 128, 129). In contrast to the proteasome inhibitor\n        bortezomib, MLN4924 is more specific because it does not inhibit bulk proteasomal\n        degradation (Ref. 96). The functional mechanism of\n        MLN4924 involves formation of the MLN4924\u2013NEDD8 covalent adduct, which is similar\n        to the first intermediate of the reaction catalysed by the NEDD8-activating enzyme, thus\n        efficiently inhibiting the NEDD8 E1 enzyme (Ref. 130).",
