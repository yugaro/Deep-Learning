            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are important sensors of non-self-nucleic acids derived from bacteria or viruses and are crucial mediators of innate anti-microbial responses through the production of inflammatory cytokines and type-I IFNs [1], [2]. In addition, pDCs have been implicated in the development of several autoimmune diseases, including lupus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS) and type-1 diabetes [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Following abnormal release of self-DNA during inflammatory processes, pDCs are activated through TLR signalling and subsequently produce type-I IFN [8]. Importantly, a few years ago, the notion emerged that pDCs act not only as innate sensors but can also function as bona fide antigen (Ag) presenting cells (APCs) and directly impact T cell responses [9]. It was shown that pDCs capture and process Ags [10], and load antigenic peptides onto MHC class I (MHCI) [11] and MHC class II (MHCII) molecules [12], [13], [14]. The modulation of Ag-presenting pDC functions led to important consequences on T cell immunity, the outcome being highly dependent on the cytokine microenvironment [15].",

            "text": "Many studies, including those investigating oral tolerance and allograft models, suggest that steady-state Ag-presenting pDCs exclusively promote T cell tolerance [16], [17], [18]. Although the nature of the factors controlling distinct pDC functions remains to be established, once activated, pDCs exhibit both immunogenic and tolerogenic functions. For example, using mice exhibiting a specific loss of MHCII expression by pDCs, we showed that CpG-B activated pDCs present Ag and promote effector Th17 cell differentiation, a property that can be exploited for anti-tumor vaccines [19]. Pro-pathogenic Ag-presenting pDCs were similarly described in a mouse model of atherosclerosis in which pDCs induced pathogenic Th1 cells [20]. In addition, BST-2 mediated specific Ag delivery to CpG-activated pDCs led to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Th1 cell differentiation and triggered protective immunity against viral infection and tumor growth [21]. In contrast, in the context of EAE, Ag targeting to pDCs via Siglec-H promoted CD4+ T cell anergy and inhibited CNS inflammation [22]. We previously demonstrated that in EAE, pDCs present myelin Ags on MHCII molecules to induce the expansion of suppressive Tregs, a phenomenon correlated with disease amelioration [23].",

Depending on the experimental context, IDO can be induced either by IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, or TGF-\u03b2. CTLA-4 binding to cell-surface expressed costimulatory molecules promotes IDO production by pDCs through IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signalling [27], [28], [29], [30]. Furthermore CD200-Ig binding to his cognate receptor induces IDO in an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 dependent signalling pathway [31]. Both IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathways result in IDO+ immunosuppressive effects which are closely dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.",

In contrast, recent work has implicated IDO expression in pDC immunoregulatory functions, including Treg induction, in inflamed LNs. Furthermore, IDO production by tumor-associated pDCs has been correlated to in vitro Treg-mediated suppression. However, the nature of the cells expressing IDO, as well as the impact on Treg functions in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, remain undetermined.",

We further established that IDO expression is positively regulated in steady-state pDCs following MHCII-mediated interactions with Tregs. During autoimmune disorders, such as EAE, IDO expression by MHCII competent pDCs is mandatory to confer suppressive functions to pDC-induced Tregs. IDO-competent Ag-presenting pDCs promote Tregs that inhibit autoimmune effector T cell responses in LNs, resulting in reduced disease severity. Therefore, we have identified a bidirectional interaction between pDCs and Tregs that favours self-tolerance.",

Consistently, IDO preferential expression by steady-state LN pDCs compared to cDCs was also observed in Balb/c mice, ruling out a mouse C57BL/6 strain restricted effect (Supplementary Fig. 1A). IDO expression by pDCs was shown to be induced by T-cell produced cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b2 [35], [47]. To determine whether, in steady state, T cells are involved in the regulation of IDO expression by pDCs, we measured IDO mRNA in Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice, which are devoid of T cells. Compared to WT mice, pDCs from steady-state LNs of Rag2\u2212/\u2212 exhibited a significant reduction of IDO mRNA, which was in fine comparable to levels obtained in IDO\u2212/\u2212 pDCs (Fig. 1B). We next tested whether interactions with T cell were required for IDO induction in pDCs of na\u00efve mice. We examined IDO expression in pDCs from LNs of mice expressing a monoclonal population of CD4+ T cells specific to OVA peptide, OT-II Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice. IDO expression was significantly reduced and was comparable to what was seen in Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1B). Thus, OT-II transgenic CD4+ T cells were insufficient at inducing IDO in pDCs.",

            "text": "This result might be explained by a low TCR self-reactivity for MHCII molecules of the OTII transgenic CD4+ T cells [48]. To test the possibility that distinct TCR self-reactivity would exhibit differential ability to induce IDO expression in pDCs, we isolated pDCs from different CD4+ TCR transgenic Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice that express distinct levels of CD5, which reflects clone-specific strength self-reactivity [48]. Each TCR transgenic T cell population display a specific surface amount of CD5 that covered a range from low (Marilyn, TCR specific for HY), medium (Smarta, TCR specific for LCMV), to high (AND, TCR specific for Pigeon Cytochrome c) (Fig. 1C). IDO mRNA expression was reduced in LN pDCs isolated from all TCR transgenic Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 1C), showing that IDO induction in pDCs is independent of TCR self-reactivity. An alternative hypothesis which might explain why IDO expression in negligible is a potential specific requirement of Tregs in regulating IDO expression in pDCs, this population being almost absent in LNs of the TCR transgenic T cell mice tested (Fig. 1D). Consistently, MOG35\u201355-loaded Rag2\u2212/\u2212 pDCs, exhibit a significant restoration of IDO expression when co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells, which contain a low but significant frequency of Foxp3+ cells (Fig. 1E). Moreover, pDCs isolated from LNs of Scurfy mice, which are devoid of Foxp3+ Tregs [44], presented a significant reduction of IDO mRNA expression compared to WT pDCs (Fig. 1F). Thus, our data suggest that Tregs significantly contribute to induce IDO expression by pDCs in steady-state LN. We next evaluated whether Ag-specific pDC-T cell contacts were required to promote IDO expression in pDCs. To do so, cultures were done using in vitro generated BM-derived pDCs, for which IDO mRNA levels were found to be negligible, reinforcing the idea that a crosstalk with T cells is indeed required for pDCs to competently express IDO (Fig. 1G). When co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells, a modest increase in IDO mRNA expression was observed in BM-derived pDCs (Fig. 1G). IDO expression was further increased by 2 fold when pDCs were previously loaded with MOG35\u201355 peptide, reaching similar levels of expression as pDCs isolated from WT LNs (Fig. 1G), Therefore, MHCII-restricted Ag-specific interactions with CD4+ T cells significantly contribute to the induction of IDO expression in pDCs. To test a role for Tregs in this process, we repeated co-culture experiments using 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells that were separated into in CD25hi and CD25neg populations. While 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25neg cells were incompetent at inducing IDO, 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25hi cells significantly enhanced IDO mRNA levels in pDCs loaded with MOG35\u201355 (Fig. 1H), confirming that Tregs are mandatory at promoting IDO expression in pDCs. pDCs co-cultured with total 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells exhibit a slight, but not significant increase in IDO mRNA levels compared to pDCs co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25hi cells, suggesting that although Tregs are required to promote IDO, non-Treg CD4+ T cells might also contribute to this process (Fig. 1H).",

            "text": "To clearly demonstrate that MHCII-restricted Ag specific interactions between pDCs and T cells are necessary to induce IDO in pDCs, we used genetically deficient mice that selectively lack MHCII expression by pDCs. These mice have been described before and are deficient for the promoters III and IV (pIII + IV) of CIITA, the master regulator for MHCII expression [38]. In mice, CIITA is under the control of cell specific promoters, pI, pIII and pIV [49], [50] (Supplementary Fig. 2). Absence of pIV leads to MHCII abrogation on cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs), resulting in the lack of CD4+ T cell positive selection. To restore CD4+ T cell thymic positive selection by MHCII competent cTECs, bone marrow (BM) cell precursors from pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 mice need to be injected into irradiated WT recipients (pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT) and compared to WT \u2192 WT controls. pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice exhibiting genetic deficiencies compared to WT \u2192 WT, it is possible that distinct immunological environments will affect IDO expression by pDCs. Therefore, to immerse MHCII competent and deficient pDCs in an identical milieu, we performed mixed BM chimeric mice using BM cells from Ubi-eGFP WT and pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 mice (ratio 1:1) that were co-injected into irradiated recipient mice expressing the congenic marker CD45.1 (Fig. 2A). LN cells were sorted 2 months later as pDCs and cDCs from donor BM cells (gated on CD45.2+) and further separated as WT (eGFP+) or pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 (eGFP\u2212) cells (Fig. 2A and B). We confirmed that cDCs expressed little IDO mRNA (Fig. 2C). IDO expression by MHCII deficient pDCs was impaired compared to MHCII competent pDCs in mixed BM chimeric mice (Fig. 2C). Since cells were isolated from the same LNs, decreased IDO expression in absence of MHCII expression by pDCs was not related to different cytokine expression profiles, but linked to a defective MHCII expression by pDCs. An alternative explanation is that CIITA directly acts as a transcription factor regulating IDO gene expression. However, we observed a similar reduction of IDO mRNA in pDCs isolated from H2-Db\u2212/\u2212 mice (not shown), ruling out this hypothesis. Altogether, our data demonstrated that MHCII-restricted Ag specific interactions with Tregs are required for the induction of IDO expression by pDCs in steady-state LNs.",

IDO has been shown to exert a protective role in EAE using either IDO\u2212/\u2212 mice or IDO blocking antibodies [51], [52]. Therefore, we have quantified IDO mRNA expression in different cell types sorted from LNs draining the site of EAE immunization (day 10) in wild type (WT) mice. IDO was predominantly (>5 fold) expressed by pDCs compared to other LN cells (Fig. 3A). Levels of expression were comparable to steady-state LN pDCs (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Next, we analysed IDO expression by MHCII deficient pDCs during EAE. pDCs and cDCs were sorted from draining LNs of WT \u2192 WT and pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice 10 days after EAE induction. Again, cDCs expressed little IDO mRNA (Fig. 3B). We observed a substantial reduction in IDO expression by pDCs sorted from pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT compared to WT \u2192 WT chimeras (Fig. 3B). Differential IDO expression by MHCII competent and MHCII deficient pDCs might be explained by distinct inflammatory cytokinic environments in WT \u2192 WT and pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice, as the latter developed more severe EAE [23]. Therefore, we performed mixed BM chimeric mice using as before BM cells from Ubi-eGFP WT and pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 mice (ratio 1:1) that were injected into irradiated CD45.1 recipient mice. EAE was induced in mixed BM chimeric mice, and LN cells were sorted 10 days after immunization as pDCs and cDCs from donor BM cells (gated on CD45.2+) and further separated as WT (eGFP+) or pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 (eGFP\u2212) cells. IDO expression was significantly impaired in MHCII deficient compared to MHCII competent pDCs isolated from LN of EAE mice (Fig. 3C). Therefore, decreased IDO expression in absence of MHCII expression by pDCs was not related to different cytokine expression profiles between WT \u2192 WT and pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT chimeras during EAE, but rather linked to a defective MHCII expression by pDCs. Altogether, our data suggest that IDO expression by LN pDCs is dependent on their expression of MHCII molecules, independent on the inflammatory status of the mice, and reflects a more general regulation of IDO protein expression at the mRNA level.",

We backcrossed DEREG mice, in which Foxp3+ Tregs can be selectively depleted using diphtheria toxin (DT) injection [36], with pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 mice and generated DEREGxpIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT chimeras (Supplementary Fig. 4 A\u2013C). In untreated mice, as previously described [23], EAE was exacerbated (Supplementary Fig. 4D) when pDCs did not express MHCII. Moreover, EAE clinical course was similarly aggravated in DEREG \u2192 WT treated with DT and DEREGxpIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT chimeras injected or not with DT (Supplementary Fig. 4D). Encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell frequencies were increased in DT-injected DEREG \u2192 WT and DEREGxpIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice compared to un-injected DEREG \u2192 WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4E). This demonstrates that the depletion of Tregs and the absence of MHCII expression by pDCs similarly enhance pathogenic T cell priming and disease severity. Altogether, our data show that pDC-instructed Tregs inhibit the priming of encephalitogenic T cells in LNs during EAE.",

            "text": "We next evaluated whether IDO was implicated in the regulation of encephalitogenic T cell priming during EAE. Knowing that MHCII deficient pDCs exhibit impaired IDO expression both in steady-state and during EAE (Fig. 2, Fig. 3C), we analysed EAE development in WT \u2192 WT, pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT and IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT chimeric mice. As before, disease was exacerbated in mice lacking MHCII on pDCs (pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT) compared to control WT \u2192 WT animals (Fig. 4A). This could be consequent to either an absence of Ag-presentation by pDCs and/or a resulting defect in IDO expression by pDCs from pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice. Consistently with previously published data [51], [52], mice deficient for IDO (IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT) developed aggravated EAE compared to WT controls. Importantly, clinical scores of IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT were comparable to mice lacking MHCII on pDCs (Fig. 4A). Notably, we did not notice any significant impact of IDO deficiency during EAE induced by transferring MOG35\u201355-specific 2D2 CD4+ effector T cells (Fig. S5), suggesting a critical role for IDO in the modulation of pathogenic T cell priming in SLOs during EAE. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured effector cytokine production by T cells before clinical symptom appearance (day 9) in IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT, pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT and WT \u2192 WT chimeras. Elevated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 producing encephalitogenic CD4+ T cell frequencies were observed in LNs of IDO deficient mice (IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT) and mice lacking MHCII expression by pDCs (pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT) compared to WT \u2192 WT controls, (Fig. 4B). Foxp3+CD25hi Treg proliferation was impaired in pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice, whereas it was unaffected in IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT mice (Fig. 4C, left), showing that MHCII-mediated Ag presentation, but not IDO expression by pDCs, promoted Foxp3+ Treg proliferation. The proliferation of Foxp3+ Tregs exhibiting a suppressive phenotype (CD103+ICOS+) [53] (Fig. 4C middle), as well as the frequency of IL-10 expressing Foxp3+ Tregs (Fig. 4C right), were significantly decreased in LNs from both pIII + IV\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT and IDO\u2212/\u2212 \u2192 WT compared to WT \u2192 WT mice. Our results identify a new role for IDO in impacting the ability of Tregs to suppress encephalitogenic T cells in LNs.",

            "text": "We have shown that IDO mRNA was preferentially expressed by pDCs compared to other LN cells both in steady-state and during EAE (Fig. 1, Fig. 3A). However, whether restricted IDO expression by pDCs is sufficient and required to inhibit disease development still need to be clarified. To address this, we used BDCA-2 DTR mice in which endogenous pDCs were depleted following DT injection [54]. It has been demonstrated that active immunization induces DT toxicity, and may therefore confound experiments in DTR transgenic mice for neuroinflammatory models, such as EAE [55]. To avoid this problem, we generated BM chimeric mice by injecting BM cells from BDCA-2 DTR into irradiated WT recipients. In these chimeric mice, no signs of toxicity or lethality in DT-treated mice upon EAE induction were observed. Moreover, efficient depletion of endogenous pDCs in the blood and LNs of BDCA-2 DTR \u2192 WT chimeras was achieved after DT injection (not shown). We transferred (i.v.) MOG35\u201355-loaded WT or IDO\u2212/\u2212 pDCs into DT-treated BDCA-2 DTR \u2192 WT chimeras one day prior to EAE induction. In these settings, IDO was selectively supplied - or not - by adoptively transferred pDCs. Following EAE induction, only WT, but not IDO\u2212/\u2212 pDCs significantly inhibited disease development (Fig. 5A). Foxp3+CD25+ Treg proliferation was increased in LN upon pDC transfer compared to control BDCA-2 DTR \u2192 WT EAE mice, whether transferred pDCs expressed IDO or not (Fig. 5B), confirming that IDO expression by pDCs is not involved in MHCII-dependent, pDC-mediated, Treg expansion. In contrast, the frequencies of suppressive Tregs co-expressing CD103 and ICOS (Fig. 5C), expressing high levels of CD25 (Fig. 5D), or upregulating the activation marker CD69 (Fig. 5E), were significantly reduced in LN from BDCA-2 DTR \u2192 WT EAE mice transferred with IDO\u2212/\u2212 pDCs compared to WT pDCs. These results demonstrate that during EAE, IDO expression by pDCs is required to elicit pDC-mediated suppressive Tregs.",

Purified CD4+CD25+ cells, which are predominantly Foxp3+ for all conditions (Fig. 6A), were transferred into WT hosts one day prior to EAE induction (Fig. 6A and B). Tregs primed in WT mice reduced EAE incidence, delayed disease onset, and conferred significant protection as we have previously reported [23]. In contrast, Tregs primed in mice lacking MHCII expression by pDCs did not exhibit any suppressive activity (Fig. 6B and Table 1). Strikingly, Tregs primed in absence of IDO did not confer any delay in disease onset, nor reduced EAE severity (Fig. 6B and Table 1). Frequencies of donor Tregs primed in WT and IDO\u2212/\u2212 mice were similar in dLNs (day 3) and dLNs and SC (day 15) of recipient mice. These results suggest that the absence of EAE protection by Tregs primed in IDO deficient mice does not rely on an impaired migration of donor cells, but rather results from impaired intrinsic suppressive functions (Supplementary Fig. 6A and B). Accordingly, compared to Tregs isolated from WT EAE mice, Tregs primed in IDO deficient EAE mice were significantly less efficient at suppressing MOG35\u201355 loaded DC induced 2D2 CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Tregs isolated from na\u00efve WT and IDO\u2212/\u2212 mice did not confer any suppression, further suggesting that Ag-specific priming in IDO+ context is required for the acquisition of Treg suppressive functions (Fig. 6C). In agreement, in vivo, only Tregs activated following EAE immunization in WT mice efficiently inhibited EAE incidence and severity (day 14), whereas neither Tregs isolated from na\u00efve WT, nor Tregs isolated from na\u00efve or immunized IDO\u2212/\u2212 mice, conferred any protection upon transfer into EAE mice (Fig. 6D). Therefore, EAE-mediated activation is mandatory to confer IDO-dependent Treg suppressive functions.",

            "text": "Whether pDCs exhibit tolerogenic or immunogenic APC functions in different immunogical context is an important matter of debate, and might depend on their own ability to produce inflammatory cytokines, as suggested by previous studies [9]. pDC tolerogenicity has been correlated to their expression of IDO in different settings [24], [31], [35]. In a mouse model of skin inflammation, IDO was induced in pDCs either after IFN-\u03b3 or TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, the first pathway promoting IDO enzymatic activity-dependent tryptophan depletion, the second one implicating IDO phosphorylation and subsequent Treg induction [35]. Here we show that already in steady-state, pDCs are the major expressors of IDO in LNs. We further provide evidence that IDO expression in na\u00efve pDCs is regulated through Ag-specific MHCII-restricted interaction with Foxp3+ Tregs. First, pDCs isolated from TCR tg mice in which CD4+ T cells all recognize a non-expressed antigenic peptide, exhibited substantially reduced IDO expression, independently of the self-reactivity of the TCR. Second, in absence of an existing Treg population in those TCR tg mice, LN pDCs exhibited a dramatic reduction in IDO expression. In addition, pDCs isolated from LN of Treg-deficient Scurfy mice expressed very little IDO mRNA. We cannot exclude that in Scurfy mice, the non-Treg CD4+ T cell population, which is strongly biased towards a pro-inflammatory autoimmune repertoire compared to WT mice, might impact IDO expression. Nevertheless, IDO expression by pDCs from T cell deficient mice was induced after co-culture with a CD4+ T cells only when the later contained a descent Treg population. In addition, IDO restoration was further dependent on the presence of the cognate antigenic peptide. The contribution of Treg in inducing IDO in pDCs has been suggested before [56], however without real evidence for a requirement of MHCII-restricted, Ag-specific interactions between pDCs and Tregs. Whether a particular Treg subpopulation would be specifically involved in this crosstalk with pDCs to induce IDO expression, and possibly the expression of other genes as well, remains to be determined. A role for IL-10 has been demonstrated in IDO expression stabilization [57]. Therefore, it is possible that IL-10 producing Tregs might be more competent to induce IDO up-regulation in pDCs. Our results reinforce the idea that Treg exhibit their Ag-specific immunomodulatory roles by impacting different cellular targets, not only by inhibiting effector T cells [58], inducing tumor-associated DC death [59] but also by promoting pDC tolerogenic functions. Future investigations will determine whether other pDC-specific tolerogenic features similarly depend on interactions with Tregs.",

MHCII-deficient pDCs nevertheless still exhibit a strong impairment in IDO expression upon EAE. Therefore, neither IFN-\u03b3, nor TGF-\u03b2, was sufficient to induce IDO in absence of MHCII expression by pDCs. In addition, we show that pDCs tolerogenicity in EAE context is dependent on their expression of IDO. First, in IDO deficient mice, encephalitogenic T cell frequency was increased, and as a consequence, disease was exacerbated. Second, adoptively transferred Tregs inhibited EAE only when isolated from actively MOG35\u201355 immunized WT, but not IDO\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that Tregs need to be primed in an IDO sufficient microenvironment to acquire their suppressive functions. Third, in LNs, IDO was predominantly expressed by pDCs, in both na\u00efve and EAE mice. Finally, in an experimental setting in which we controlled IDO expression exclusively in pDCs, we observed an inhibition of EAE, as well as an increase in suppressive Tregs, only when pDCs expressed IDO. Notably, Treg induced after Ag-specific interaction with IDO+ pDCs are necessary to inhibit pathogenic T cells in LNs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that IDO expression by pDCs is required for the generation of suppressive Tregs that, upon Ag-specific activation, competently inhibit encephalitogenic T cells during EAE priming phase. In conclusion, we showed that na\u00efve pDCs are high IDO expressors in the LN, a property acquired after a cross-talk with Foxp3+ Tregs. By expressing IDO, pDCs become competent to confer suppressive functions to Tregs in the context of EAE, where Ag-presenting IDO+ pDCs promote suppressive Tregs that inhibit the priming of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells and dampen CNS autoimmunity. Future investigations will determine whether other pDC features and functions, apart from IDO expression, are impacted following interactions with Tregs. Together, our data have identified a new regulatory role for Tregs in shaping Ag-presenting pDC functions towards tolerogenicity in autoimmunity.",
