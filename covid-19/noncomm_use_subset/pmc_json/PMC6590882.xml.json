For this reason, matters involving women\u2019s health have focused primarily on pregnancy and childbirth of fertile women, and other related issues have been under the radar of public healthcare services and the medical field [1]. However, women have other health problems, such as cancers specific to women and infection caused by sexually transmitted diseases. Changes in lifestyle and environment have a greater negative effect on women\u2019s health than men\u2019s health. Demographics and physical characteristics, education, economics, labor, culture, social environments, and women\u2019s role in the family all factor [2].",

For example, in 2008 Jung analyzed the news framing journalism perspectives of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus in the 1990s [3]. The concept of framing is related to the agenda-setting tradition but expands the research by focusing on the essence of the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. The basis of framing theory is that the media focuses attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning. In 2001, Andsager reported on making sense of breast cancer and breast implants [4]. In 2013, depression and mental health coverage in the media were analyzed [5] and factors involved in the stigma of suicide prevention were studied [6].",

This dictionary has more than 900,000 built-in words, which is the largest among domestic dictionaries and has an advantage that it can be used directly in the R, a computer programming language. In Step 2, a dictionary of gynecological medical terminology was used in order to increase the probability of extracting terminology related to women\u2019s health, because terminology such as various names for diseases related to women\u2019s health cannot be extracted with only a basic dictionary. In Step 3, only Korean nouns from article sentences were extracted (using the SimplePos22 morphological analysis function provided in the KoNLP library [21]) and stored for each article. In Step 4, general nouns (e.g., \u201cmost\u201d, \u201cthis year\u201d, \u201clast year\u201d, \u201cwomen\u201d, \u201cillness\u201d, \u201ccase\u201d, \u201cperson\u201d, and \u201cdegree\u201d) were deleted that were not related to women\u2019s healthcare topics, and only the remaining words from the Step 4 were stored for each article to be part of the final data set.",

In general, it is important to determine a reasonable number of topics in topic modeling using LDA. In novels without a clear unit of source data, the decision what should be done as a document unit is one of the most important decisions [22]. However, in newspaper articles, each article is usually used as a document, and the level of difficulty involved in determining the number of topics depends mainly on the interpretability of the topics [23]. In the present study, the number of topics was extracted and analyzed from 5 to 30 to determine the appropriate number. As a result, the number of topics was set at 10, taking into account interpretability and meaningfulness. After determining the number of topics, the top 20 most frequent words were extracted for each topic using the collapsed Gibbs sampling technique for the LDA analysis algorithm [18,24]. In particular, in the present study, LDA analysis was performed for each period before 2000, 2001\u20132005, 2006\u20132010, and since 2011, and topics of each period were obtained. Through this analysis, (1) the representative topics of women\u2019s health-related issues by period and year and (2) how the topics have changed were identified.",
