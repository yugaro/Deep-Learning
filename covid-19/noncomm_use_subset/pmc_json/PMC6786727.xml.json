In this study, in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest cases included those in the general ward; cases where the arrest took place in the emergency department, operating room, or intensive care unit were excluded. The inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest rate was defined as the CPR rate/1,000 adult admissions. The statistics on the CPR rate of each hospital were gathered from CPR reports and statistics about adult admissions and discharges. We collected detailed data from each hospital from 2013 to 2015 regarding the cardiopulmonary arrest rate of patients at least 18 years of age in the general ward, the number of annual adult admissions, and whether a dedicated intensivist was present. Additionally, rapid response team characteristics were analyzed at the two institutions that had implemented RRSs.",

National university-affiliated hospitals showed relatively fewer cardiopulmonary arrests than private hospitals in 2015. High-volume hospitals also demonstrated a lower cardiopulmonary arrest rate than medium-volume hospitals. This tendency was presumed to be due to the strong medical and human resources available in national university-affiliated hospitals and high-volume hospitals. While all high-volume hospitals had dedicated intensivists, only 57% (four of seven hospitals) of medium-volume hospitals had them. None of the medium-volume hospitals had an RRS. Furthermore, three of five national university-affiliated hospitals (60%) were high-volume hospitals, whereas four of nine private hospitals (44%) were high-volume hospitals, which could explain the differences between cardiopulmonary arrest at national university-affiliated hospitals and private hospitals (Supplementary Table 2). However, these results should be interpreted with caution because this study was not a comprehensive investigation, but instead only compared the structural characteristics of a few hospitals. All included hospitals were tertiary hospitals and were accredited by Ministry of Health and Welfare. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the levels of care were above standard.",

Second, we excluded data from hospitals that recorded the highest and lowest cardiopulmonary arrest rates and from the period when EMRs were not used. However, there are some limitations to this investigation. This study was a retrospective analysis that only included data from 14 of the 43 tertiary hospitals, which could have introduced a selection bias. Regarding the data, we collected admission statistics from each hospital and did not review individual medical records. Each hospital had a different system of reporting CPR rates, including standards to fulfill CPR reports and responsible parties. Hence, it is possible that some data are not apparent from the accessible CPR cases. Nevertheless, the aim of this research was to determine the incidence of cardiopulmonary arrest, not to analyze its causes. It was also not intended to be a comparative analysis that reflected various variables and characteristics of each hospital. Finally, this study was designed as a before and after study, and it is challenging to conduct randomized controlled trials in this manner.",
