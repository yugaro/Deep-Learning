            "text": "This case report is focused on Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia in pregnant women (third trimester). Pneumonia in pregnancy is associated with morbidity and mortality to the fetus and mother. The risk of intubation is higher in pregnant women with hypoxemic respiratory failure compared to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women with pneumonia may develop worse hypoxemic respiratory failure due to the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Physiological changes such as increased progesterone lead to mucosal airway edema. The mechanical effects of an enlarged uterus result in a reduced functional residual capacity (FRC). Decreased esophageal sphincter tone, delayed gastric emptying, and increased gastric pressure (as early as 14 weeks and above) increase the risk of gastric aspiration during NIV. The risk of aspiration is 1 in 10,000. Therefore, NIV is only indicated in pregnant women who are fully conscious and able to control their airway with adequate respiratory effort. It is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive monitoring and treatment in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are required for better outcome of the fetus and mother [1]. A trial of NIV may have a benefit to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure, provided it is used wisely. It is reported that NIV can avoid intubation in 54% of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and therefore reduce ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) by approximately 20% and reduce the mortality rate in the ICU by up to 54% [2]. However, the usage of NIV has remained controversial in severe pneumonia. The benefit of NIV in pregnant women is not clear. However, Masclans et al. reported that the success rate of NIV was as high as 40% in treating hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia [3]. A proper patient selection, a cooperative patient, and clinician skills are the key features of successful NIV. The trend of using NIV has increased by approximately 25% [3]. The percentage of patients receiving non-invasive ventilation in Malaysia increased almost six-fold between 2004 and 2012, from 3.7% to 21.7%. Therefore, the usage of NIV in the non-pregnant population secondary to pneumonia is controversial but is becoming increasingly acceptable.",

She gave a history of sore throat, dry cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, weakness and headache. Her examination revealed reduced air entry on both lower zones of the lung with crepitation on auscultation. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Arterial blood gases (ABG) showed severe hypoxemia with po2 only 90 mmHg despite delivery of fio2 70% via NIV. She had an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 200 mg/L on admission. Her chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities consistent with severe pneumonia (Fig. 2) in comparison with her normal chest radiograph taken 2 years prior to illness (Fig. 1). Her tracheal aspirate and urine culture were negative. There were also negative results for nasopharyngeal swab for H1N1. She also tested negative for dengue, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis and syphilis. She was admitted to our ICU and was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) bi-level mode. Her condition gradually worsened within a day of admission. She was given intravenous rehydration and broad spectrum antibiotics, tazocin 4.5 g every 6 hours and levofloxacin 750 mg once daily and antiviral osetalmivir. She was planned for intubation if her dyspnea worsened, her respiratory rate increased to more than 35 breaths per minute, or there was a drop in consciousness level. The patient was started on a BiPAP, bi-level positive airway pressure (Philips-Respironics) after poor oxygenation with a high flow mask 15 liters oxygen. She was successfully weaned from NIV on day 3 of ventilation. She was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on day 5 and discharged home on day 13 of admission in good condition.",

In cases similar to our own, Banga et al. managed pregnant women with severe type 1 respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with 3\u20134 days of NIV. In these cases, major organ dysfunction and impaired consciousness were the key factors underlying the decision to institute NIV [6]. NIV is contraindicated in the setting of cardiac or respiratory arrest and in cases where the patient is uncooperative or unable to fit the mask [7]. It is also unsuitable for patients who are status post facial, esophageal or gastric surgery; patients with extreme anxiety, copious secretions, anatomical anomalies of the upper airway, or craniofacial trauma or burns. NIV should also be avoided in patients with a high risk of aspiration and patients who are unable to protect their airway. In these situations, the use of NIV has a failure rate as high as 50% in patients with hypoxemia [7].",

The setting can be increased gradually to achieve the desired oxygenation. The difference between IPAP and EPAP should be at least 4 cmH2O. Next, the oxygen requirement was set up followed by holding the mask over the face by hand. Initially, it should not be fixed. If required, EPAP and IPAP settings can be increased in 1\u20132 cm H2O increments, after which the inspiratory time and rise time should be set. Lastly, the interface was secured to the patient with head straps to avoid excessive air leak [7]. Excessive tightness should be avoided since it can cause intolerance and skin lesions [7].",

The fluid was given in view of worsening lactate, low concentrated urine output and capillary refill time less than 2 seconds. On day 3 of admission, the fluid was stopped because of suddenly worsening pulmonary infiltrates. Bedside echocardiography was conducted and revealed good heart function. A tracheal aspirates culture result came back as mixed growth. Serial C - reactive protein results showed a decreasing trend. On day 4 of admission, the patient showed signs and symptoms of improvement as evidenced by reduced tachypnea maintained with lower bi-level settings.
