They have been widely applied in basic and translational research, such as protein interaction studies, immune profiling, vaccine development, biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics, etc. 1-12. For example, Zhang et al. used a human protein microarray to better understand how arsenic, which is used in chemotherapy, disrupts cancer signaling pathways and, further, to identify potential targets of novel therapeutic treatments. Of the 16,368 proteins that were screened, 360 arsenic binding proteins were identified, which may be novel targets for cancer treatment 7. Anderson et al. used protein microarrays to discover a 28-autoantibody biomarker signature of early stage breast cancer with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 61.6%, respectively 13. By combining those autoantibodies with several protein biomarkers, Provista Diagnostics developed the first protein-based blood test for early breast cancer detection called Videssa\u00ae Breast 14. Ayoglu et al. screened sera from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using protein microarrays containing 11,520 purified protein fragments and then validated those results using bead-based arrays 15. The arrays indicated that Anoctamin 2 autoantibodies and the MS-associated HLA complex DRB1*15 allele were strongly associated. Additional experiments showed that Anoctamin 2 aggregates near and inside lesions within human MS brain tissue 15.",

            "text": "Protein microarrays can be classified into two different types, purified or cell-free, based on whether the proteins are produced in vivo or in vitro, respectively 16. Purifying proteins is labor-intensive, requires method optimization and multiple manipulations, exhibits highly variable yields of different proteins, and may not result in naturally-folded or functional mammalian products due to expression in non-mammalian systems (e.g., E. coli, yeast). Cell-free protein microarrays overcome these challenges by depositing RNA or DNA on the slide surface and rapidly expressing them just before an experiment (~2 h) through the use of various cell-free expression systems (e.g., lysate from wheat germ, insect cells, rabbit reticulocyte and human cells). Compared to purified protein microarrays, cell-free protein microarrays are more likely to produce naturally-folded mammalian proteins due to the decreased sample manipulation and use of enhanced cell extracts with native chaperone proteins. Moreover, the use of nucleic acids vastly simplifies the production of custom arrays since any protein can be produced as long as the gene-of-interest is synthesized; for example, arrays can be produced that represent a specific proteome or signaling pathway 17-20.",

Next, we show the feasibility of M-NAPPA in performing high throughput screening for immune-dominant tuberculosis (TB) antigens through the use of an ultra-high density M-NAPPA TB proteome array containing four subarrays with 4,045 TB open reading frames (ORFs) on one slide. Using M-NAPPA TB protein microarrays, four new immune-dominant antigens in the sera of BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs were identified, which were then validated using ELISA. Finally, we propose a high throughput target discovery and verification pipeline based on the M-NAPPA approach.",

Multiplexed hits identified during the screening step could then be de-convoluted in the subsequent verification step using the standard, non-multiplexed NAPPA array where each feature displays only one protein (i.e., M=1). The objectives of the second step would be to identify which proteins were responsible for the positive multiplexed signal and to verify whether the hits were real. This approach exploits the high flexibility of cell-free microarrays, in which arrays can be customized by simply re-arraying individual plasmids encoding for the multiplexed features-of-interest.",

As the frequency of hits in the screen increases, more proteins will need to be tested as individual features during the verification step. Taken to the extreme, if one protein per multiplexed feature were a hit (hit rate = 1/M), all multiplexed features would require deconvolution, making the multiplexing approach impractical. However, such a high hit rate is not reflected by data collected by numerous studies; for example, the hit rate was < 5% in most of our previous NAPPA-based screening studies with 10k human genes (Figure 1B). We generated a mathematical model (Materials and Methods) to find the optimal M that would take into consideration array space and the cost of screening and verifying hits using our 10k protein human collection at different hit rates. In Figure 1C, the x-axis represents the number of genes per spot (M) while the y-axis represents the number of spots or proteins that are needed for the two-step screening process. Notably, when the hit rate is < 5% for 10k proteins, a relatively small number of spots would be needed for the entire study (screening + verification) with 5 proteins multiplexed per feature in the initial screen, thus representing a good compromise between the number of initial features screened and the subsequent number of features that would be needed for deconvolution and verification.",

These tiny wells hold only 1200 pL and use only 0.12 ng of plasmid DNA. We applied the multiplex concept to HD-NAPPA using a mixture of plasmids encoding for IA-2, GAD2 and p53 proteins. We then detected their expression and display using specific antibodies; all of these proteins were readily detectable when printed as a three-plexed mixture (Figure S10). We then multiplexed 4,045 tuberculosis (TB) ORFs 32 onto HD-NAPPA microarrays as four separate subarrays using three gene plasmids per well (M=3), resulting in an M-HD-NAPPA microarray displaying > 16k proteins on a single slide.

Compared to the control mock sera pool using PBS buffer (n=5), four features on M-NAPPA arrays showed increased signals with the BCG samples (n=4) (Figure 7B). To deconvolute and validate those targets, we repeated the serological assay for those candidate proteins, along with two non-responsive control proteins (Rv2077A and Rv2682c), using RAPID-ELISA and the individual sera from the guinea pigs. The antibody levels of four antigens (Rv3405c, Rv1078, Rv2853 and Rv0928) in BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs were significantly higher than that of the PBS control with a p-value <0.01 (Figure 7C, Figure S11). According to the Tuberculist database (http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/), these proteins are involved in regulation, cell wall and cell processes, and are considered to be in the proline-glutamic acid / proline-protein-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) protein families (Figure 7D).",

We found M-NAPPA can be reproducibly fabricated with spot-to-spot, zone-to-zone and slide-to-slide CVs that are similar to those obtained with NAPPA (Table S4). The spot-to-spot and zone-to-to zone CVs for protein-protein interactions were also similar between the two array platforms (Table S5). While the correlations within and between different M-NAPPA slides were good (i.e., R = 0.93 for both) (Figure 3 and Figure S6), with some size adaptation, the reproducibility could eventually be further improved with the use of automation equipment like the HS 4800 Pro Hybridization Station (Tecan Trading AG; M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland).",

Each feature of a natural protein microarray typically represents a mixture of unknown proteins. Thus, responsive hits on natural protein arrays require a challenging and time-consuming process to determine the identity of the protein responsible for the response. This may require further purification, identification by mass spectrometry and additional response testing of recombinant proteins 46, 47. In the case of M-NAPPA, the identities of the proteins in each mix are known in advance and the plasmids encoding for each protein are available for secondary testing.",

However, it should be noted that there are situations in which using a non-multiplexed array format would be more appropriate. For example, NAPPA should be used when investigating protein functions or when the number of proteins to be screened is low. Additional attributes of M-NAPPA should be considered as well. Large, multiplexed proteins (\u2265 65 kDa) on M-NAPPA are displayed at a lower level (37 - 40%) than their non-multiplexed counterparts (Figure 2C). This issue could be resolved by increasing plasmid DNA concentration before printing or reducing multiplicity per spot. Alternatively, since large proteins represent a small fraction of the proteome, a hybrid array containing multiplexed spots with plasmids encoding for proteins with low to moderate MWs and non-multiplexed spots for large proteins (\u2265 65 kDa) could be employed. In addition, PTMs that occur during cell-free protein expression may affect the protein display or activity on M-NAPPA arrays 42. We have observed that the human expression system contains the ability to phosphorylate some proteins (data not shown); other types of PTMs (e.g., glycosylation, acetylation) by the expression system are not well known or reported. In our studies, PTMs did not appear to affect protein expression, protein-protein interactions, or the identification of serological antigens on M-NAPPA when compared to NAPPA (Figure 2, Figures 4-7 and Figure S7).",
