In addition to causing annual outbreaks during winter, the influenza virus can undergo antigenic drift/shift and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics every 10\u201340 years. Therefore, from a public health perspective, influenza is a disease that requires international surveillance and preparation [1]. To reduce the disease burden of influenza virus and improve public health, South Korea has implemented, with excellent results, the national immunization program (NIP) for influenza. Among the countries that are a part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea had the second highest influenza vaccination rate for people aged \u226565 years in 2013 [2]. However, to our knowledge, accurate summaries on the origins of influenza NIP and the changes made to reach its present form do not exist. Therefore, we sought to outline the course of influenza NIP transformation since its inception in 1997 and to review its present status.",

The NIP's management structure is comprised of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC); provincial and city public safety units; and city, district, and county public health units. The following are the responsibilities of public health units: determining vaccine demands/requirements, conducting vaccination programs, and recording and reporting individuals' vaccination statuses and any adverse events (AEs). The provincial and city public safety units oversee the achievements of public health units concerning the vaccination and act as a bridge in conducting epidemiological investigations of AEs and reporting the results to the KCDC. The role of the KCDC is to manage the vaccine supply and registration, to review epidemiological investigations of vaccine-related AEs, and to manage compensations [34567891011121314151617].",

However, because of the delayed occurrence of influenza outbreaks, the vaccination period was later changed to September\u2013November in 2002 and September\u2013December in 2004. Considering the fact that the effects of a vaccination last up to 6 months on average, the vaccination period was adjusted to October\u2013December in 2005 and has remained so until now (except for the 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons when the vaccination period started early (September\u2013December) to include the H1N1 influenza vaccine) [34567891011121314151617]. In 2017, free vaccine recipients were expanded to cover young children from 6 months to <5 years old. As such, for those infants receiving their first two-dose vaccination, their first dose was given in early September and the second dose was completed before the start of the season to develop sufficient immunity. Infants who reach 6 months of age after January 2018 will be allowed to receive free vaccinations until the end of April 2018 [17].",

In 2010, the target group was extended to include children aged <5 years and people living with high-risk family members (Table 1). Currently, pregnant women are included in the World Health Organization's first-priority influenza vaccination group, but were not included in the NIP's influenza target group until 2003. Even then, vaccination was not recommended for pregnant women who were in their first trimester, except for high-risk cases. In the 2005\u20132006 season, influenza vaccination was recommended for all pregnant women [3456789101112131415161718]. During the 2016\u20132017 season, influenza instances were highly prevalent and rapidly widespread among students. Therefore, in an effort to counteract the risks accompanying communal lifestyles through frequent interactions with other individuals, all individuals aged 60 months to 18 years were included in the priority group for influenza vaccination in September 2017 [17].",

No clear record existed when was the exact season the influenza vaccination became free for all elderly adults aged \u226565 years, but it was likely during the 2005\u20132006 season, when the national financial support for the program substantially increased, which previously operated only on municipal budgets [6]. In the 2016\u20132017 season, infants aged 6 months to <12 months were added to the free vaccination program, and the government reported a gradual extension of the free vaccination to young children [16]. During the 2017\u20132018 season, free vaccination services are expected to cover 2,140,000 young children from 6 months to <5 years old [17].

Thus, to improve the accessibility, convenience, and safety of influenza vaccination, the NIP began to commission influenza vaccination to private health sectors in the 2015\u20132016 season [15]. As a result, the overall influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults aged \u226565 years increased from 73% to 80.9%, when compared to the 2014\u20132015 season. In particular, the influenza vaccination rate increased in elderly adults aged \u226585 years by approximately 13% (from 56.1% to 69.3%) [16]. Thus, the transition to private health sectors has been a fairly successful strategy in the improvement of influenza vaccination rates and safety of elderly adults aged \u226585 years, who are less likely to access group vaccinations through public health units (Fig. 1).",

For young children aged 6 months to <5 years, private clinics purchase vaccines independently to reflect vaccine safety and vaccination convenience. From 2004, the government initiated the management of Internet-based monitoring of the vaccine supply status at public health units. In 2012 and 2015, the government implemented real-time services and developed vaccine supply systems for clinics and hospitals participating for NIP, respectively, thereby allowing for immediate response and management when vaccine shortage or supply problem occurs [34567891011121314151617].",

This number includes all those who received the influenza vaccine free of charge, but not all those who paid for the vaccine, as registration in the system is not mandatory for those ineligible to receive free vaccination. Considering the number of people who paid for the vaccine but were not registered in the system, the increase rate could even be higher. The vaccination rate for adults aged \u226565 years is continuously increasing because of the expansion of services to private clinics. During the 2016\u20132017 season, 5,720,000 out of 6,940,000 eligible individuals (82.4%) were vaccinated. The vaccination for infants aged 6 months to <12 months was initiated in the 2016\u20132017 season, and among the 320,000 eligible infants, the vaccination rate reached 87.9% (280,000) during the first round and 87.6% (270,000) during the second round of vaccinations.",

In addition, patients or their care givers can report their vaccination and any AEs through the Vaccination Adverse Event Reporting System (https://nip.cdc.go.kr). If an AE is reported after vaccination, the epidemiological study team at the city/provincial level performs a basic epidemiological investigation, and then the epidemiological study team at the KCDC performs a more detailed investigation. The vaccination injury study team conducts an investigation of the injury and reports the results to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program committee. Once the committee has completed reviewing the reports and the required compensation, the results are reported to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The Ministry of Health and Welfare then decides on the amount of compensation, notifies, and pays the patient through the KCDC.",

The first confirmed AE related to the seasonal influenza vaccine and compensated was a case of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in 2004. From 2004 to 2016, only 12 cases of AEs have been confirmed to be related to the influenza vaccine [2122]. Aside from the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, other reported AEs included peripheral neuropathic disease, cellulitis, and purulent myositis. A relationship between narcolepsy and adjuvanted vaccine has been consistently questioned; however, there have been no related cases reported within Korea to date. Only a single case, in 2012, was considered to be related to the influenza vaccine, after administration of the live vaccine [2122].",

            "text": "The NIP for influenza overcame the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and many of its shortcomings by changing the vaccine supply control system and immunization registration and AE management systems and by delegating immunization to private healthcare agencies. With these improvements, the safety of the influenza vaccine has been confirmed, domestic vaccine production has been successfully established, and high vaccination rates have been achieved among infants aged 6 months to <12 months and elderly adults aged \u226565 years. However, the main problems that are unique to the influenza virus and vaccine, such as vaccine mismatching and low vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults and children, remain. Support/funding for influenza risk groups other than infants (6\u201359 months) and elderly populations is also lacking, and a considerable influenza disease burden remains in Korea [2728]. As the target influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults has been achieved, the next step is to conduct further research to evaluate the most cost-effective type of vaccine (e.g., quadrivalent, adjuvanted, or high dose). The NIP for influenza has been operating for 20 years, with the primary objective of reducing the disease burden in high-risk groups. However, for high-risk groups, other than elderly adults and children aged \u226459 months, there has been very little control of immunization, resulting in a blind spot. Thus, a strategy should be formulated to improve the vaccination rate among the two high-risk groups: (1) pregnant women and (2) people with chronic health conditions, who most likely experience complications associated with influenza.",
