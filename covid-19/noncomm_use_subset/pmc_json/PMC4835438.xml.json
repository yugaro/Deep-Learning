Contaminated disposable items are placed in a Y-bag immediately,\nin the place that they were used.c. Sterilization method: At least 15 minutes at 121\u2103, 1 atm, by autoclaved. Environmental surfaces (devices, surfaces of objects, etc.) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excrement\ni. Disinfectants : 70% alcohol or 0.5% sodium hypochloriteii. Specimens of feces or body fluids are disposed through the sewage system, in accordance with sewage regulations.iii. When disposing of liquid waste, care must be taken that it does not splash\n\n",
