Three antisera against rat cathepsin B were used. The first was a rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant rat pro-cathepsin B (ProB) (Rowan et al., 1992). The second was a rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant mature rat cathepsin B. These sera were generously provided by J. Mort (Shriner's Hospital, Montreal, Canada). A third rabbit antiserum raised against biochemically purified rat cathepsin B was obtained from A. Saluja (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit serum (Cappel Laboratories, Malvern, PA, and Worthington Biochemical Corp., respectively) was used as a secondary reagent for Western blotting by enhanced chemiluminescence with luminol. Zysorbin\u2013protein A was from Zymed Labs, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). An affinity-purified polyclonal anti-gamma\u2013adaptin antibody (AP-1) was kindly provided by M. Robinson (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) and an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against phogrin was obtained from J. Hutton (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). To immunolocalize syntaxin 6 and proinsulin, we used the monoclonal antibodies 3D10 (Bock et al., 1997) and GS9A8 (O. Madsen, Hagedorn Research Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark), respectively, in combination with a secondary rabbit anti\u2013mouse antibody (DAKOPATTS, Copenhagen, Denmark). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the CD-MPR (MSC1) and CI-MPR, raised by G. Lienhard (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), have been used previously (Klumperman et al., 1993). A rabbit anti-serum raised against the cytosolic tail of the human CI-MPR (III/4) was kindly forwarded by Von Figura (Georg-August University, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany).",

Ultrathin cryosectioning was performed as described, using the improved pick-up method with a mixture of sucrose and methyl cellulose (Liou et al., 1996). (Multiple) Immunolabeling was performed according to the protein A\u2013gold method, as described previously (Slot et al., 1991). Mouse-derived antibodies (proinsulin and syntaxin 6) were indirectly marked by protein A\u2013gold via a rabbit anti\u2013mouse IgG bridging antibody. To establish the relative distribution patterns of CD-MPR, AP-1, phogrin, and syntaxin 6 (see Table I), areas of the grid were selected that contained cells exhibiting well-preserved ultrastructure. Then, at a magnification of 20,000, the gold particles were counted randomly by scanning along fixed tracks, and each encountered gold particle was attributed to the compartment over which it was located, based on gold particles that were within a distance of \u223c30 nm from a membrane. The number of gold particles found over each of these compartments was finally expressed as a percentage of the total number of gold particles counted. In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, quantitations were performed in sections that were double-immunogold labeled for proinsulin and CD-MPR, AP-1 or phogrin, which allowed us to identify IGs by the presence of proinsulin label (Kuliawat et al., 1997). By this definition, 20\u201325% of all granules were considered immature in different experiments. In these cells, 525 gold particles were counted for CD-MPR, 699 for AP-1, and 504 for phogrin, respectively. In exocrine cells, morphological criteria were used to distinguish newly formed granules (moderately dense content, irregularly shaped, and with considerable size variation), from mature granules (dense content, uniformly sized, lacking membrane buds, and with a characteristic oval or round appearance). In exocrine pancreas, of all secretory granules, \u223c20% were immature by this definition. In these cells, 500 gold particles were counted for CD-MPR and 1,287 for AP-1. In our preparation of parotid cells, \u223c35% of all secretory granules were considered immature. In these cells, 485 gold particles were counted for syntaxin 6 and 504 for AP-1. To establish the degree of colocalization for syntaxin 6 and AP-1, double immunogold\u2013labeled grids were randomly searched for syntaxin 6\u2013positive membranes with a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. Each coated, syntaxin 6\u2013positive membrane, i.e., TGN membranes and vesicles as well as IGs, was then scored as positive or negative for AP-1. In both \u03b2-cells and parotid, 300 syntaxin 6\u2013 and clathrin-positive membranes were analyzed this way. ",

Evidently, in ultrathin sections these condensing vacuoles could not always be unambiguously discriminated from free IGs.

The tissue was then preincubated for 10 min in methionine- and cysteine-free DME (Sigma Chemical Co.) with the same additives at 37\u00b0C. After pulse labeling with [35S]met/cys for 30 min, the tissue was washed three times in a large vol of complete DME chase medium with the above additives. The bathing media from subsequent defined chase periods were then collected. All bathing media were freshly oxygenated before use, since this was found necessary to maintain secretory performance. To examine the presence or absence of labeled lysosomal enzyme in the regulated secretory pathway at specified chase times, equal amounts of pulse-labeled lobules were incubated in the presence or absence of stimulation with a secretagogue. For parotid lobules, the secretagogue used was 30 \u03bcM of d,l-isoproterenol. For pancreatic lobules, this secretagogue was comprised of a mixture of 25 \u03bcM of carbachol, 1 mM 8Br-cAMP, and 130 nM phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate. When the cells were to be analyzed, the lobules were lysed by sonication as described (Arvan and Castle, 1987) and then diluted into immunoprecipitation buffer (Kuliawat et al., 1997).

This entry into IGs is not inhibited when the normal carbohydrate-dependent mechanism of ProB sorting is partially or completely blocked, but efficient sorting out of maturing granules requires a high affinity for MPRs. We reasoned that if lysosomal enzymes exit the regulated secretory pathway via a similar mechanism to that operative in the TGN, then one should predict the presence of MPRs and AP-1 in IGs. In \u03b2 cells, immunoreactivity with an antibody against a proinsulin cleavage site (Arg31\u2013Arg32) is one criterion that can be used to discriminate IGs from mature granules (Orci et al., 1985; Kuliawat et al., 1997). In the present study, we used this antiproinsulin antibody in double-immunogold labeling studies to perform a detailed morphological analysis of the subcellular distribution of CD-MPR and AP-1 in \u03b2 cells.",

The concentration of phogrin in the plasma membrane and endosomes was below detection level, consistent with relatively rapid reuptake and recycling to the biosynthetic pathway after exocytosis.

Using this as a guide, Fig. 3 shows ultrathin cryosections of parotid cells in which we found both CI-MPR and AP-1 labeling associated with secretory granules with less condensed contents that were found in close proximity to the Golgi complex (i.e., IGs), whereas there were relatively few gold particles over granules with dense contents (i.e., those at later stages of maturation). Indeed, by semiquantitative analysis, we confirmed that AP-1 labeling declined as a function of granule maturation (Table I), although occasional label could be found on coated membranes that appeared to bud from secretory granules with somewhat denser contents. In these cells, we focused on CI-MPR since labeling for CD-MPR appeared low, and both MPRs exhibit similar distributions in the TGN region (Klumperman et al., 1993). The CI-MPR was found over noncoated as well as clathrin-coated membrane areas of IGs (Fig. 3\nA), whereas AP-1 localized predominantly to the clathrin-coated membranes (Fig. 3\nB). Labeling of CI-MPR and AP-1 was also observed over TGN vesicles and tubules and, like in endocrine cells, AP-1 was found to be associated with clathrin-coated membrane buds emerging from TGN tubules (Fig. 3\nB).

To test this question, we began by immunogold localization of cathepsin B in rat parotid acinar cells. This tissue was of particular interest because it has been previously reported that using this technique, secretory granules fail to label with an antibody raised against rat liver cathepsin B (Tooze et al., 1991b\n), whereas lysosomes in these cells were positively stained. By contrast, we found that immunolabeling revealed a high number of gold particles representing cathepsin B in granules with a less dense content (i.e., IGs), whereas there were relatively few gold particles over granules with dense contents (Fig. 5\nA). Furthermore, occasional cathepsin B immunoreactivity was detected in clathrin-coated evaginations that appeared to be budding from forming granules (Fig. 5\nB). ",

By Western blotting, the mature, \u223c31-kD lysosomal form of cathepsin B clearly predominated in the steady state (Fig. 6\nE), although small amounts of ProB were occasionally detected (data not shown). After synthesis, intracellular conversion of newly synthesized ProB to mature B was also apparent, but even up to 2 h of chase, a predominant fraction of the new enzyme was still in the precursor form (Fig. 6\nA), suggesting that this fraction had not yet been delivered to lysosomes. Interestingly, in medium samples collected during the first chase hour, unstimulated release of ProB was apparent, suggesting the possibility of transport through constitutive and/or constitutive-like secretory pathways. Exposure to isoproterenol (a secretagogue) during either the first or second chase hour clearly demonstrated stimulus-dependent release of newly synthesized amylase, the secretory granule marker from this tissue (Fig. 6\nB). In addition, ProB release was detectably increased upon isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 6\nC, left two lanes). In the second chase hour, although the unstimulated secretion of ProB was much less than before, stimulated exocytosis of ProB upon secretagogue exposure was still clearly demonstrated (Fig. 6\nC, right two lanes). Although later chase times were not examined intensively along with stimulated amylase release, stimulated secretion of a diminished fraction of newly synthesized lysosomal proenzyme remained apparent, providing no evidence for formation of mature cathepsin B within stimulatable granules, at times up to 5 h of chase (Fig. 6\nD). Taken together, the morphological and biochemical data in Figs. 5 and 6 strongly suggest that ProB enters IGs in the rat parotid, but that intragranular concentrations of the hydrolase eventually decline, while the lysosomal form of cathepsin B appears gradually after a delay, ultimately achieving accumulation of mature B that is apparent upon detection at steady state. Thus, as in endocrine pancreatic \u03b2 cells (Kuliawat et al., 1997), ProB behaves as a transient resident of the regulated secretory pathway. ",

Such a conclusion would suggest that secretory granules in this tissue do not serve primarily as an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of lysosomal cathepsin B, but rather as an endpoint. By contrast, constitutive-like secretion from the unstimulated rat exocrine pancreas lasts up to 7 h of chase, and therefore one might predict that ProB enters IGs in this tissue, with conversion to the mature form occurring at a much slower time scale. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a specific immunoelectron microscopic labeling for cathepsin B in exocrine pancreatic cells. Nevertheless, it was of interest to examine whether a clathrin-mediated escape route from maturing granules might also be operational in this tissue. In agreement with Tooze et al. (1991b), upon Western blotting of freshly prepared pancreatic tissue, the predominant steady-state form of intracellular cathepsin B was the mature, \u223c31-kD lysosomal form (Fig. 6\nH), although trace amounts of ProB could be detected. However, in pulse-chase experiments up to 3 h, little or no newly synthesized ProB had yet reached lysosomes, based on conversion to the mature form. At chase times >3 h, ongoing conversion was detected (data not shown), but such long chase experiments were not routinely feasible in our hands, since a significant decline in tissue performance (i.e., stimulus-dependent secretion) was observed at these later times. However, upon secretagogue exposure during the chase period from 1\u20133 h, there was a modest (10\u201315%) stimulus-dependent release of newly synthesized amylase and other granule proteins (Fig. 6\nF) along with clear stimulus-dependent release of ProB (Fig. 6\nG, left two lanes). An immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of \u223c30 kD was also immunoprecipitated in the stimulated secretion, but if this band is mature B, it must have been created after secretion, since the intracellular B up to this chase time had not yet been converted from the precursor form (Fig. 6\nG, right two lanes). Thus, we cannot state with certainty the kinetics and site(s) of ProB conversion in this tissue from these data. However, unlike the results of Tooze et al. (1991b), these data clearly indicate that ProB rather than mature B enters the IGs of the rat exocrine pancreas.",

By contrast, syntaxin 6, a mammalian homologue of yeast Pep12, has been implicated in the delivery of TGN-derived AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes (Bock et al., 1997). Since IGs serve at least in part as a functional extension of the TGN (Arvan and Castle, 1992), the AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles budding from IGs might contain this particular SNARE protein. Indeed, in both endocrine \u03b2 cells and exocrine parotid cells, syntaxin 6 labeling was found over TGN and IG membranes, whereas mature granules were nearly devoid of label (Figs. 7 and 8). In \u03b2 cells, 25% of all syntaxin 6 label was found in membranes exhibiting a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. Of these coated membranes positive for syntaxin 6, nearly one-third were buds emerging from IGs (Fig. 7\nA). By double-immunogold labeling, approximately half (49%) of the coated, IG-associated buds positive for syntaxin 6 were also labeled for AP-1. CD-MPR also colocalized with syntaxin 6 in IGs (Fig. 7\nB). The degree of syntaxin 6/AP-1 colocalization in the coated membranes of the TGN (53%) was similar to that observed in IGs. ",

The \u201csorting for entry\u201d model hypothesizes a selective delivery system in the TGN, such that only regulated secretory proteins can enter IGs whereas other proteins are excluded. However, in regulated secretory cells, the high flow rate into IGs may limit the sorting efficiency for certain kinds of proteins in the TGN. For such molecules, an extended sorting opportunity provided by IGs might lead to increased sorting efficiency. With this in mind, the \u201csorting by retention\u201d model postulates that selective sorting of soluble proteins may not be required at the entry point into forming granules, but as IG maturation progresses, the condensation of regulated proteins improves the efficiency of their retention, whereas other luminal proteins can be sorted out efficiently (by receptors) (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994) or inefficiently (by fluid-phase transport) (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1992).",

            "text": "We now present the first direct demonstration that a sorting pathway out of maturing granules is a common feature in regulated secretory cells, involving MPRs (at least in part), and mediated by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles. First, we have now provided powerful immunoelectron microscopic evidence (Figs. 1\u20134 and Table I) that MPRs are present in both endocrine and exocrine IGs, that MPRs colocalize with AP-1 in clathrin-coated evaginations that bud from these IGs, and that the densities of CD-MPR and AP-1 decrease in parallel, \u223c90%, upon maturation of secretory granules. The selectivity of MPR removal from maturing granules is proven by the fact that phogrin, a membrane protein of insulin granules, exhibits no retrieval from IGs. Second, immunoelectron microscopy of rat parotid tissue indicates the presence of cathepsin B immunoreactivity in IGs of this exocrine tissue, including finding the enzyme in IG-associated clathrin-coated buds, whereas few gold particles are observed at later stages of granule maturation (Fig. 5). Moreover, our biochemical data establish unequivocally that in exocrine cells of both the parotid and pancreas, a significant fraction of newly synthesized procathepsin B molecules initially enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway, just as has been observed in the endocrine pancreatic \u03b2 cells (Fig. 6; Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994; Kuliawat et al., 1997). Importantly, these data overturn the previous hypothesis that mature B can be formed in the TGN of exocrine secretory tissues (Tooze et al., 1991b\n), although extracellular activation of ProB after secretion (especially from the exocrine pancreas) must be viewed as a distinct possibility (Fig. 6). The finding that, under physiological conditions, mature exocrine secretory granules have low levels of cathepsin B\u2013immunogold label, whereas mature cathepsin B is the predominant form detected at steady state (by Western blotting), is consistent with the scenario that lysosomal proenzymes and MPRs independently enter IGs, whereafter MPR\u2013ligand complexes are routed out of the regulated secretory pathway by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles during granule maturation. At the approximate time of their arrival in lysosomes, we hypothesize that cathepsin B and other hydrolases are converted to their mature forms, except under pathological circumstances that may potentially lead to premature enzyme activation (Hirano et al., 1991).",

            "text": "Recently, the membrane-associated form of carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme involved in prohormone processing, has been proposed to serve as a receptor mediating the transport of regulatory proteins into IGs of neuroendocrine cells (Cool et al., 1997). However, no evidence presented to date has distinguished an action of CPE in sorting for entry (i.e., at the TGN) versus sorting by retention (i.e., in IGs). Further, proteins that are not thought to interact with CPE have been reported to efficiently enter the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells (Burgess et al., 1985; Fennewald et al., 1988; Stahl et al., 1996). Nevertheless, for some regulated secretory proteins, association with other binding proteins may well facilitate the entry step into IGs. However, based on the fact that (a) lysosomal proenzymes can abundantly enter IGs in a manner independent of recognition by known receptors (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994); (b) prohydrolase departure from maturing granules occurs by a mechanism whose efficiency is dependent on binding affinity for MPRs (Kuliawat et al., 1997); and (c) there is a significant decline of MPR immunolabeling over granules as they mature (this report), we suggest that in both endocrine and exocrine secretory cells, at least a portion of (soluble and membrane) proteins not destined for storage in mature granules may routinely advance from the TGN into IGs, only to be sorted out subsequently.",

Indeed, we observed a parallel decline in syntaxin 6 labeling with AP-1 during granule maturation (Figs. 7 and 8 and Table I). According to the SNARE hypothesis, there is a requirement for specific protein interactions in order that specific membrane fusion events may proceed (Sollner et al., 1993). Our data indicate the distinct possibility that it may be necessary to remove certain inappropriate SNARE proteins from the regulated secretory pathway to create the identity of mature secretory granules, thereby preserving their fusion specificity for the cell surface. Furthermore, the relatively high amount of syntaxin 6 in IG and TGN-derived clathrin-coated buds, and its efficient removal from maturing granules (Table I), suggests that syntaxin 6 is actively sorted into CCVs and may function in a SNARE complex that leads to the fusion of these vesicles with membranes of the endosomal system. Current evidence indicates that syntaxin 6, which shares homology with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (Bock et al., 1996), is the mammalian counterpart of the yeast Pep12. Yeast cells expressing mutant Pep12, like certain other class D vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) mutants, accumulate small post-Golgi vesicles that are thought to be involved in the delivery of soluble hydrolase precursors to the prevacuolar compartment (Becherer et al., 1996). Likewise, syntaxin 6 has been implicated in the targeting/fusion of TGN-derived AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles with the endosomal system by forming a complex including mVPS45, just as Pep12 forms a complex with yeast VPS45 (Bock et al., 1996; Tellam et al., 1997). Thus, the data in regulated secretory cells (this report) suggest that IG-derived as well as TGN-derived, MPR-positive, AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles may use syntaxin 6 as part of their mechanism for targeting/fusion with endosomal membranes. However, our data do not formally exclude the possibility that syntaxin 6 could serve its function as a SNARE either before it enters TGN- or IG-derived CCVs, or after its delivery to membranes of the endosomal system. Clearly, further research will be needed to demonstrate syntaxin 6 function as well as its precise site(s) of action.",

We must remain open to the possibility that vesicle budding kinetics and efficiency might vary between granules or between cells, therefore persisting at low levels at relatively late stages of apparent granule maturation. It is interesting to note that lysosomal proenzymes would not be expected to bind MPRs at the acidic pH normally found in mature endocrine granules, whereas mature exocrine granules are not especially acidic (Arvan et al., 1984; Orci et al., 1987), which would allow prolonged MPR\u2013ligand interaction and favor a more prolonged sorting track in these tissues. Indeed, this possibility might help to reconcile the apparent slow conversion of procathepsin B to the mature form in exocrine tissues (Fig. 6) as well as the detection of cathepsin B immunoreactivity reported in seemingly mature granules (Tooze et al., 1991b\n). However, we emphasize that procathepsin B normally requires an extremely acidic environment for intramolecular autocatalysis to the mature form (Mach et al., 1994); thus, in contrast to the conclusion of Tooze et al. (1991b), we feel strongly\u2014and our data are consistent with the idea\u2014that the cathepsin B that enters the regulated secretory pathway represents the inactive precursor form.",

Recent studies (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994; Dittie et al., 1996; Kuliawat et al., 1997) and the data in this report are consistent with a role for MPRs in the formation of AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles from maturing granules, and for syntaxin 6 in the targeting of those vesicles to endosomes. It seems probable that additional selected membrane proteins are sorted out of IGs by vesicle budding, perhaps involving coat recruitment, whereas other proteins (e.g., phogrin) are destined to be retained. Certain isoforms of peptidylglycine-\u03b1-amidating-mono-oxygenase have been proposed to exit maturing granules via vesicle budding (Milgram et al., 1994). Also furin, a membrane-bound endoprotease that resides predominantly in the TGN and actively recycles through multiple compartments, has recently been reported to be present in isolated IGs but not mature granules (Dittie et al., 1997). Even acid phosphatase has been reported to be removed selectively during granule maturation (Novikoff et al., 1977). Future studies will be needed to determine whether each of these membrane proteins exits maturing granules via the same class of clathrin-coated vesicles.",

Equal aliquots of chase media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography.

Note the stimulus-dependent secretion of the lysosomal prohydrolase. (C) The small amount of a \u223c35-kD band directly beneath ProB does not represent mature B, was not a consistent finding, and most likely represents partial proteolysis in the medium samples. (G) The small stimulated release of a \u223c30-kD band directly beneath ProB most likely represents proteolysis of ProB in the medium sample rather than mature cathepsin B, because mature cathepsin B still had not appeared intracellularly at the 3-h chase time. (D) Immunoprecipitation of cathepsin B yielded only a modest stimulus-dependent secretion of labeled ProB during the 3\u20135 h chase period.
