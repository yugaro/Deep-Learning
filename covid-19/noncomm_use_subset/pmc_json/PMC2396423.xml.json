The pri-miRNAs are cleaved by the nuclear Drosha-DGCR8 complex to produce miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) of \u223c70 nt (9\u201312). Pre-miRNAs are transported by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by Dicer to produce the miRNA duplex of \u223c22 bp. The single-stranded mature miRNA programs RISC for mRNA cleavage (perfect complementarity) or translational repression (incomplete complementarity) (13,14). Several miRNAs are encoded in genomic clusters that are transcribed as polycistronic pri-miRNAs, allowing the production of multiple miRNAs from a single transcription unit (15,16). RNAi can be induced using RNA polymerase III promoter-driven shRNA expression vectors that direct siRNA expression. Another siRNA expression strategy uses a pre-miRNA backbone that is transcribed by polymerase II or III (17\u201320). An optimized pre-miRNA design includes the single-stranded flanks of the pri-miRNA (21\u201323).",

            "text": "Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple shRNAs in a combinatorial RNAi approach, which increases the genetic barrier for viral escape (31,32). Similar strategies have previously been validated for antisense DNA and ribozymes (33\u201335). However, expression of these shRNAs necessitates multiple expression cassettes and the construction of rather complex vectors that will not easily provide equimolar shRNA expression levels. Furthermore, when the same promoter is reiterated in a lentiviral vector, recombination occurs with high frequency on the repeated sequences (36). Alternative anti-escape strategies include the use of a second-generation of siRNAs that target-specific escape variants (37), the use of tandem siRNA transcripts (38), long hairpin RNAs (39) or the targeting of cellular co-factors that are critically involved in viral replication (40\u201344). Another attractive approach is to express multiple antiviral siRNAs from a single polycistronic miRNA transcript, such as a natural genomic miRNA cluster that can be expressed from an RNA polymerase II promoter. This strategy is of particular interest for antiviral purposes because miRNA-like transcripts were shown to be more effective antivirals than regular shRNAs (17,45). Furthermore, using an RNA polymerase II promoter will allow lower and regulated expression, thereby reducing the risk of toxicity due to oversaturation of the RNAi machinery (46).",

We show that the expression of individual miRNAs is greatly enhanced in multiplex hairpin transcripts that are properly processed into functional miRNAs.

For the initial experiments we chose miRNAs miR-20 and miR-19b (Dwt and Ewt) because they contain the smallest number of bulges and thus most resemble the original shRNA structure (Figure 2). The original mature miRNA and the antiviral miRNA strand are boxed. We modified the passenger strand of the basepaired stem to mimic structural features (mismatches, bulges and thermodynamic stability) of the natural pre-miRNA. We constructed a series of antiviral miRNAs with the effective r/t5 and ldr9 siRNAs in the Dwt backbone, which produces the antiviral guide strand from the 5\u2032 side of the hairpin duplex. The 19-nt antiviral siRNAs were positioned either at the 5\u2032 (Dr/t5-19\u2032 and Dldr9-19\u2032) or 3\u2032-end (Dr/t5-19\u2032and Dldr9-19\u2032) of the original miRNA sequence (Figure 2, upper panel). Additional constructs were made in which we extended the antiviral siRNAs at the 3\u2032-end to 23-nt, which is the actual size of the wild-type mature miRNA (Dr/t5-23 and Dldr9-23) (Figure 2, Table 1). We repeated this strategy for the r/t5 inhibitor in the Ewt hairpin, which produces the antiviral guide strand from the 3\u2032 side of the hairpin stem (Figure 2, lower panel). We designed a similar set of constructs in which the 19-nt r/t5 siRNA was positioned at the 5\u2032 (Er/t5-19\u2032) or 3\u2032-end (Er/t5-19\u2032) of the wild-type miRNA and an extended 23-nt version (Er/t5-23).\n\n",

Of the original Dr/t5, Dldr9 and Er/t5 constructs, we selected Dr/t5-19 because it is the best inhibitor. As a consequence, the ldr9 inhibitor was introduced in the E hairpin. We tested the effectiveness of all new constructs against luciferase reporters and HIV-1 (Table 1). The observed inhibition is sequence-specific because non-matching miRNAs did not have any effect. Furthermore, the expression of the control renilla reporter was stable in all experiments. The miRNA constructs with 19-nt anti-HIV sequences showed a somewhat higher activity than the extended versions. We therefore selected the 19-nt inhibitors for the construction of antiviral miRNA polycistrons. For simplicity, we removed the 19 indications from the miRNA names (e.g. Apol47-19 becomes Apol47).",

This could be due to the use of different promoters (polymerase III U6 versus polymerase II CMV, respectively), but may also be due to differential RNA processing efficiencies. We therefore wanted to compare the siRNA level expressed from each construct. We titrated 39\u20132500 ng shr/t5 construct in 293T cells and compared that with 2500 ng Dr/t5 construct. Two days post-transfection, total cellular RNA was isolated from the transfected cells and analyzed on a Northern blot with an r/t5 probe that detects the guide (antisense) strand (Figure 4). The original Dwt hairpin was used as a negative control. Quantification of the RNA bands showed that expression of the antiviral 19-nt siRNA by construct Dr/t5 is about 15\u201330-fold lower than the expression by construct shr/t5 (Figure 4, see numbers below the blot). Although the siRNA expression level of Dr/t5 is significantly lower than that of shr/t5, the inhibitory effect measured in the luciferase and HIV-1 inhibition assays is comparable. This result suggests that the intrinsic inhibitory capacity of Dr/t5 is in fact much greater than that of shr/t5.\n",

We tested the ability of these hairpins to inhibit the Luc-Apol47 reporter (Figure 5A, left). Firefly luciferase expression was normalized to the renilla luciferase expression from the co-transfected pRL plasmid. We set the luciferase expression in the presence of pBS at 100%. The knockdown efficiency of the single Apol47 hairpin was \u223c40%, but chaining it with the Bwt hairpin or the Awt-Ewt cluster enhanced the silencing activity. As a negative control, we included the Awt-Ewt construct. As a positive control, we included the original shRNA. A similar pattern was observed for inhibition of HIV-1 production (Figure 5A, right).

We first determined the knockdown efficiency of each individual hairpin within the multiplex transcripts by co-transfection with the corresponding luciferase reporter into 293T cells (Figure 5B, Supplementary Table 2). Constructs encoding the Awt-Ewt cistron and individual wild-type or non-matching miRNAs were used as negative controls. For inhibitors Apol47, Cgag5 and Eldr9, we observed a remarkable enhancement of silencing activity when chained to other hairpins. For instance, construct Cgag5 is poorly active compared to construct AC or ACDE (Figure 5B). Construct Bpol1 does not exhibit any inhibitory activity, either alone or when combined with another hairpin as in AB. Since the Bpol1 hairpin structure is rather unstable as predicted by the Mfold algorithm, this could be due to misfolding of the hairpin RNA. We therefore will not use hairpin Bpol1 in the final polycistron construct. Hairpin Dr/t5 does not benefit from linkage to other hairpins, but this is likely due to the high inhibitory activity of the individual Dr/t5 inhibitor. Strong inhibition of Luc-Dr/t5 was observed with Dr/t5, AD, ACD, ACCD and ACDE, indicating that generation of effective siRNAs from the multiplex hairpin transcripts does not depend on the miRNA position in the polycistron.",

The results are remarkably similar to the activity data in Figure 5. For instance, siRNA expression of Apol47 is greatly increased by linkage to another hairpin as in AD (Figure 6A). The Northern blot analysis of the Bpol1 and the AB inhibitors provides an explanation for its inactivity as only the \u223c60-nt Bpol1 precursor is observed (Figure 6B, indicated by an arrow). To study whether the passenger siRNA strand of Bpol1 is made, we performed a Northern blot analysis with the corresponding probe, but failed to detect any passenger siRNAs (results not shown). In contrast, properly processed siRNAs are produced from hairpin Apol47 in construct AB, indicating that the inactive B unit in the two-hairpin transcript does not negatively influence the active A unit (Figure 6A and B). In addition, siRNA production from the A hairpin is boosted for the polycistronic transcripts compared to the single Apol47 hairpin transcript. For inhibitor Cgag5, we also observed a strong increase in siRNA production when the hairpin is combined with other hairpins in a polycistronic transcript (Figure 6C). The Dr/t5 inhibitor is expressed individually and does not benefit from chaining to other hairpins (Figure 6D), which correlates nicely with the luciferase results (Figure 5B). For inhibitor Eldr9, we observed increased siRNA levels for ACDE compared to the single hairpin (Figure 6E). The combined luciferase inhibition results and the Northern blot analyses demonstrate that the silencing activity of an individual hairpin RNA can be significantly enhanced when expressed in a polycistronic transcript.\n",

We used the CMV promoter to express the transcripts because most primary miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (7), which also allows inducible or tissue-specific miRNA expression (22,53,54). Previously, several reports have demonstrated effective gene knockdown in mammalian cells with siRNAs derived from miRNA precursors (17,18,22,53).

We therefore addressed whether the miRNA-like inhibitor is correctly processed and compared the amount of siRNA produced from the miRNA versus shRNA constructs. The siRNA level produced by the shRNA construct shr/t5 is 15\u201330-fold higher than the Dr/t5 miRNA, which is likely due to the use of different promoters (RNA polymerase III versus RNA polymerase II). Interestingly, the shRNA inhibitor did only show marginally higher inhibitory activity, suggesting that the intrinsic inhibitory activity of the miRNA-like inhibitor is in fact much greater than the shRNA variant. Consistent with these results, vectors encoding hairpin structures that closely resemble a natural pre-miRNA produced \u223c12-fold more mature siRNAs than vectors encoding simple hairpin structures (21). The superior activity of natural miRNA-like inhibitors is likely attributed by the intrinsic properties of a miRNA, which is processed in the nucleus by Drosha, exported to the cytoplasm, processed further by Dicer and loaded into RISC. In the case of an shRNA, the Drosha step is bypassed, which could provide a less-efficient entry into the RNAi pathway.",

Interestingly, we demonstrate that co-expression of two or more hairpins in a single transcript greatly enhanced the silencing activity of each individual hairpin in the transcript. Northern blot analyses showed that the increased inhibitory activity correlates with higher siRNA expression levels. Multimerization of different miRNA hairpins is of particular interest for targeting of RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV because of their extreme genetic diversity and potential for mutational escape. Two recent papers presented the potential of combinatorial RNAi using two miRNA-30 hairpins (55,56). In agreement with these studies, we showed an increase in RNAi activity upon multimerization of 2, 3, 4 or 6 hairpins in a single transcript. Another study used the miR-30 backbone to multiplex artificial miRNAs and reported decreased RNAi activity for the tandem plasmid, which may be due to miRNA processing problems (57). Thus, chaining of miRNAs needs a very careful transcript design. Most studies have used either the miR-30 or miR-155 backbone because these molecules have been studied extensively. Our study focuses on the natural mir-17-92 polycistron and we demonstrate that insertion of four antiviral siRNAs creates a transcript that is properly processed into functional antiviral miRNAs that effectively inhibit HIV-1 production and replication.",

Such an off-target effect may require only a complementarity of 6\u20138 nt between the seed region of the miRNA and the target (58,59). Such a weak restraint results in numerous potential off-target genes for any miRNA. When multiple miRNAs are used, the number of potential off-targets will increase, increasing the chance of a negative effect on the treated cells. However, we observed no obvious cellular changes in a sensitive toxicity screen. Furthermore, the observed inhibition of firefly luciferase reporters clearly showed sequence-specificity as non-matching miRNAs did not have any effect and the expression of the control renilla reporter was not affected. Another study, in which artificial miRNAs were expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, conferred viral resistance without cellular alterations, suggesting that off-target effects are not significant (60). Furthermore, recently evidence emerges that siRNA sequences inserted in a miRNA backbone do not compete for transport and incorporation into RISC, while competition was observed when the same siRNA sequences were presented as synthetic siRNAs or shRNAs (61). Nonetheless, off-targeting is a genuine concern for the development of any RNAi-based gene therapy against HIV-1 and the potential risk should be assessed properly in relevant in vivo models prior to an eventual clinical application (62).",

These data, together with our previous shRNA studies (32,63), indicate that a combinatorial RNAi approach against HIV-1 results in an increased magnitude of inhibition and consequently a restriction of viral escape. Current strategies combine multiple polymerase III shRNA expression cassettes (63), which results in high expression levels. This may not always be desired in a gene therapy setting because of increased toxicity due to saturation of the RNAi machinery with siRNAs (46). The use of polymerase II promoters to express the miRNA polycistron will reduce this risk because of lower expression levels. In addition, polymerase II cassettes allow expression in a tissue-specific manner and inducible gene expression, which increases the flexibity for gene therapy and functional genomic applications (22,54).",

An interesting candidate is the WAS promoter that is active in human hematopoietic precursor cells (CD34+) and T lymphocytes, B cells and dendritic cells (64). Another intriguing possibility is to use the HIV-1 LTR promoter to express the miRNA polycistron. Transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR requires the viral Tat protein, which is produced only in HIV-1-infected cells, thereby allowing exquisite target cell specificity. This approach has previously been employed for shRNA expression (65).
