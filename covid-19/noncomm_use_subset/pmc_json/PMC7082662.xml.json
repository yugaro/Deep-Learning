A prompt investigation confirmed that the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; temporarily termed as 2019-nCoV) was responsible (1). Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was confirmed to be possible (2), and COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout China and to other countries. As of February 16, 2020, COVID-19 infections had been confirmed in 51857 patients globally, including 51174 patients in China and 683 patients outside China (3). The first COVID-19 patient was identified in South Korea (hereafter, Korea) on January 20, 2020. As of February 16, there were 29 COVID-19 patients in Korea, placing Korea in fifth place internationally in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients, after China, Singapore (72 patients), Japan (53 patients), and Thailand (34 patients). Deaths have almost exclusively occurred in China (1666 patients; 3.3%), rather than outside China (3 patients; 0.4%). The discrepancy in the death rate between China and other countries might be due to differences in the disease manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia or in other countries' capacity to manage a limited number of cases, in contrast to the overwhelming numbers of cases in China.",

Due to between-hospital differences in the required period for Institutional Review Board review, we expedited the process to report cases for which approval was received, while excluding cases under review. Consequently, we included nine consecutive patients (median age, 54 years; four men and five women) with COVID-19 infections confirmed through a pan-coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay from January 2020 through February 9, 2020 from Incheon Medical Center (7), Seoul National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.",

The readers identified all separate pulmonary lesions on CT and analyzed the longest diameter, location, shape, density, and margin of the lesions. The locations of the lesions were specified as lobar, axial, and anteroposterior. For the axial location, the peripheral lung was defined as the outer one-third of the lung, and the central lung was defined as the inner two-thirds of the lung. According to a horizontal line dividing the lung into anterior and posterior halves, locations were classified as anterior or posterior. The shapes of the lesions were first categorized as patchy, confluent, or nodular. Patchy lesions were defined as isolated focal lesions with no nodular shape in the segment, and confluent lesions were defined as large fused lesions involving multiple segments. The densities of the patchy to confluent lesions were classified as pure GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, consolidation, or a crazy-paving appearance. The densities of the nodular lesions were classified as pure GGO, part-solid, or solid. The margins of the lesions were dichotomized as ill-defined or well-defined. We evaluated whether the pulmonary lesions had a predilection for the lower lobes, pleura, or bronchovascular bundles. Furthermore, the readers evaluated the presence of air-bronchograms, the reversed halo sign, cavities, micronodules, a tree-in-bud appearance, and pleural effusion based on the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging (9).",

Indeed, COVID-19 pneumonia shows radiologic similarities to SARS and MERS pneumonia (1011121314), with a predominance of bilateral GGO and consolidative lesions in the peripheral lung. Despite the similarities in CT findings, COVID-19 pneumonia seems radiologically milder than SARS and MERS pneumonia. The proportion of patients with abnormal initial radiographic findings was 78.3\u201382.4% in SARS (1516) and 83.6% in MERS (17), but only 33% in our cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. GGO lesions on CT without any consolidation presented in 45% of our cases and in 45\u201367% of Chinese COVID-19 patients (45), in 14\u201340% of MERS patients (1011), and in 50% of SARS patients (12).",

Second, we focused on baseline CT findings that clinicians and radiologists first encountered, rather than findings from follow-up CT scans, as follow-up CT scans were performed in few patients.
