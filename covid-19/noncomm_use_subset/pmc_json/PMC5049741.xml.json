South Korea was ultimately chosen to be IVI's host country for several reasons: 1) its thriving economy; 2) its burgeoning infrastructure for R&D and life sciences research; and 3) a commitment made by the Korean government to support IVI. We were the first International Organization headquartered in South Korea. We are located on the campus of Seoul National University in the capital city of Seoul.",

According to World Health Organization estimates, nearly 2.5 million children in developing countries die every year from vaccine-preventable diseases. The second problem lies in the development of new vaccines \u2013 and not only for the \u201cbig three\u201d (i.e., HIV, malaria, TB) \u2013 but also for diseases that exert tremendous burden such as Group A streptococcal infection and dengue. Vaccine development is a lengthy and costly endeavor, and obtaining resources to develop vaccines for the public sector is especially challenging. This is related to the third issue, which is getting the message out to funders, governments, and populations at risk that the development of safe, effective and affordable vaccines is a global priority and that access to effective vaccines is both a right and a responsibility.",

In development, we tech-transfer vaccines that require manufacturing and/or scale-up to developing country manufacturers. We provide assistance, when applicable, to companies in the design of a regulatory approval pathway and the execution of corresponding clinical trials. We also provide assistance to companies in the filing for local approval and/or for World Health Organization pre-qualification (which allows the sale of the vaccine to UN agencies). Finally, in delivery, we work in the field by conducting targeted vaccination demonstration projects (for IVI's diseases of interest), as well as disease surveillance and epidemiological studies to generate the necessary data to permit informed policy decisions by governments.",

We are pleased that Euvichol (produced by EuBiologics, a South Korea manufacturer) has been recently WHO-prequalified, which should help increase the global supply of oral cholera vaccines and meet demand.
