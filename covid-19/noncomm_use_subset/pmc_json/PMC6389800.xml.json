            "text": "Salmonella enterica, subspecies enterica serotype Typhimurium can infect both animals and humans and cause food-borne gastrointestinal infections, usually through poultry, beef, pork, milk and eggs. It can also be found in non-alcoholic beer or seafood. Human infections with phage type S. Typhimurium DT104 are particularly critical, because this strain is resistant to most of the commonly used antibiotics [1]. Therefore, continuous monitoring of bacterial food contamination is necessary to prevent infections in humans. Established methods for S. Typhimurium diagnostics are time-consuming and use microbiological cultures on different liquid and solid media [2], specific fluorescence labeled DNA probes [3] or PCR [4]. Currently, high throughput diagnostics of S. Typhimurium is performed by indirect ELISA [5]. The commercially available ELISA kits, SALMOTYPE\u00ae- or Enterisol\u00ae-ELISA, use a mixture of O-antigens of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovars. Because of this mixture, cross-reactions occur with other bacteria [6]. In addition, the sensitivity varies between the different ELISA assays [7].",

Two main approaches, \u201cfull-length\u201d strategy and deconstructed strategy, have been used to design virus vectors [[18], [19], [20]]. Deconstructed versions of RNA viruses like, Potato virus X [21], Tobacco mosaic virus [22,23], Cowpea mosaic virus [24], as well as DNA viruses like Beet curly top virus [25], have been developed and successfully applied to produce recombinant proteins in plants. In the most advanced version the \u201cdeconstructed virus vectors\u201d are combined with A. tumefaciens-mediated delivery into plant cells [26].",

Two TM43-E10 antibody formats, namely single chain variable fragment (scFv) and scFv fused to the lgG Fc moiety (scFv-Fc), were designed, expressed in N. benthamiana and functionally characterized. The scFv is a smallest of the recombinant antibody formats, which is capable of antigen binding. It consists only of the variable (V) antibody regions (VL and VH) connected with a short linker peptide. The scFv-Fc fragment combines the VL, VH and Fc regions of the IgG. The scFv-Fc format might offer several advantages over the phage display-derived scFv, including bivalent binding, longer half-life and Fc-mediated effector functions [12]. Smaller antibody fragments have several advantages such as possible application of different antibody generation systems for selection/design, easier production and full antigen binding capacity of IgG [12,[27], [28], [29]].",

            "text": "The transient expression exploiting Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of expression vectors has become the preferred plant-based platform due to its advantage in speed, yield of recombinant proteins and the reduced concern for transgene escape. Transient recombinant protein production depends on both the expression vector and the plant host. Currently two types of expression vectors, non-viral or plant virus-based, can be used for transient protein production. Expression vectors utilizing a plastocyanin promoter [37] and the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- translated region of CPMV [38] are the most efficient non-viral systems described in the literature. The latest development in plant virus vectors is the vector deconstruction strategy. Deconstructed viral vectors based on TMV [18], CPMV [39], PVX [21] and BeYDV [40] provide high protein yield through a reduction to components essential for recombinant protein production. In comparison to a deleted PVX vector developed by Giritch et al. [21], the PVX vector described in this work uses the fused TGB1 and coat protein subgenomic promoter for foreign gene expression and is completely deficient in cell-to-cell and long distance movement. We have taken advantage of Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of an expression cassette controlled by the 35S promoter. Infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with pLH-PVX-m and pLH-\u03b3b-PVX-m vectors carrying scFv and scFv-Fc formats of a TM43-E10 antibody resulted in accumulation of mRNA and proteins as was evidenced by qPCR, Western blot analysis and ELISA.",

            "text": "One of the factors reducing the efficiency of transient expression is mRNA degradation by RNA silencing. The gene silencing is involved in regulating expression of endogenous genes as well as reducing or eliminating the effects of invading pathogens such as viruses [41,42]. To neutralize this silencing response and enhance the level of foreign gene expression, co-expression of proteins that are capable to interfere with components of this resistance is used routinely. These factors are known as \u201csuppressors\u201d of RNA silencing. So far, several suppressors of RNA silencing have been evaluated for their ability to counteract gene silencing and enhance foreign gene expression in transient assay, including p19 from either Artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV) [43] or Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) [44], HcPro from Potato virus Y (PVY) [37], p25 from PVX [45] and \u03b3b from Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) [46]. We investigated the influence of the \u03b3b protein from Poa semilatent virus (PSLV) on foreign protein accumulation in a transient assay. PSLV is a plus-strand RNA virus of the genus Hordeivirus with a tripartite genome consisting of RNA\u03b1, RNA\u03b2 and RNA\u03b3. RNA\u03b1 encodes a component of viral replicase. RNA \u03b2 encodes coat protein and three movement proteins. RNA\u03b3 is bicistronic and encode the other component of viral replicase and a non-structural \u03b3b protein [47,48]. \u03b3b contributes to symptom severity, systemic viral movement and RNA silencing suppression [33,49]. Although the anti-silencing activity of PSLV \u03b3b protein has been shown a decade ago [33], the mechanism of \u03b3b action has not been investigated. Several lines of evidence indicate that silencing suppressor properties of \u03b3b may be mediated by its RNA binding activities. The \u03b3b protein likely binds in a sequence unspecific manner to ssRNA via a coiled-coil domain with zinc binding sites, to prevent RNA degradation by RNA-induced silencing complex [33,50]. In this study we demonstrate for the first time the effectiveness of \u03b3b to increase the recombinant protein expression level. The increased transcription of scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 genes was detected by qPCR analysis in N. benthamiana leaves agroinfiltrated with pLH-\u03b3b-PVX-m vector when compared to pLH-PVX-m expression vector. The mRNA expression levels correlated with protein yields as was quantified by ELISA. Application of the \u03b3b silencing suppressor caused two and five fold increases in scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 accumulation, respectively.",

Typhimurium diagnostic antibodies. The minimal concentration of OmpD protein that can be detected by scFv-TM43-E10, scFab-TM43-E10 antibody fragments was 50 ng/ml.

Therefore, the scFv-TM43-E10 and scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody derivatives have been also expressed in bacterial and mammalian cell cultures and included into the functional test. The antigen binding of plant-derived scFv-TM43-E10 antibodies was similar to scFv-TM43-E10 recombinant proteins isolated from E. coli. Furthermore functional ELISA test also showed a similar functional activity for plant and mammalian cell culture-made scFv-Fc-TM43-E10 antibody fragments (Fig. 5A). Our data are in agreement with findings described in several articles with respect to the functional equivalence of the recombinant proteins produced in different expression systems. For example plant-derived 6D8 and hE16 mAbs demonstrated similar to mammalian cell-derived counterpart antigen specificity [58]. Yuan et al. [59] reported that the biological activity of antizearalenone scFv \u201cplantibody\u201d was comparable to that of a bacterially produced scFv antibody. A number of research groups investigated the binding properties of the plant-derived anti-HIV VRC01, 2G12 and b12 antibodies in comparison to reference counterparts [[60], [61], [62]]. These studies also revealed functional equivalence between plant- and mammalian cells-made recombinant proteins.",
