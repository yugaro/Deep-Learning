            "text": "Virus-induced encephalitis is a life-threatening disorder characterized by inflammation of brain tissue. The inflammation associated with brain parenchyma is linked to and a consequence of viral infections [1\u20133]. Virus-induced encephalitis is associated with misdiagnosis and delays in recognition, which may have devastating consequences for patients [4]. Additionally, the efficacy of therapies is highly time-dependent due to high morbidity and mortality rates [5,6]. Enterovirus is the main etiological agents of virus-induced encephalitis, followed by mumps, rubella, and Japanese encephalitis virus. However, the lack of unified guidelines in the assessment and management of the illness is a serious limitation [2,7]. The most common symptoms and neurological signs of virus-induced encephalitis are fever, reduced consciousness, seizures, and focal neurological deficits [8\u201310]. Patients with virus-induced encephalitis suffer from various degrees of renal damage [11]. Additionally, virus-induced encephalitis may cause serious brain damage and bleeding; therefore, prompt diagnosis and early treatment are crucial to prevent the disease from developing, and delayed treatment often results in poor prognosis [1]. In patients who are able to survive the virus-induced encephalitis, impairments of neurologic defect and cognitive, emotional, and behavioral function impairments are common [12]. However, chronic encephalitis has been reported as being uncommon, possibly owing to its viral origins, which may result in the disease being exhibited in patients that have compromised immunity, as well as in healthy individuals [13]. Thus, difficulties are faced in correctly diagnosing patients and subsequently providing prompt therapies for individuals with virus-induced encephalitis [14]. Consequently, it is important to further explore the details and mechanisms involved. At present, increasing numbers of scientific and clinical studies are being initiated to further understand virus-induced encephalitis.",

            "text": "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), are 2 cytokines that have been found to have strong links to encephalitis [15\u201317]. It has been suggested that IL-4 is crucial to the induction of the naive helper T (Th0) cells differentiating to type 2 helper T (Th2) cells [18,19]. IL-4 is known to have 2 different receptor complexes: the IL-4R\u03b1 chain and the \u03b3c chain [20]. IL-4 has a role in maintaining physiological balance and repairing tissues [21]. Moreover, IL-4 has exhibited in anti-inflammatory functions. IL-4 derived by activated CD4+ T cells can promote allergic responses [20,22,23]. Additionally, IL-10 is a cytokine produced by T cells, B cells, and macrophages, exhibiting a role in anti-inflammation and immunosuppression [24\u201326]. Virus-induced encephalitis is reported to respond to IL-10 [27]. IL-4 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms have been widely investigated in inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic polyarthritis, rhinovirus bronchiolitis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [28\u201331]. Patients previously diagnosed with virus-induced encephalitis formed the basis of the experimental exploration of this study. The IL-4 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms and their correlation to virus-induced encephalitis susceptibility, through direct sequencing, were analyzed during the study.",

Moreover, the diagnosis of encephalopathy can be achieved on the basis of higher serum thyroperoxidase antibody titer (including antithyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody) and clinical manifestations such as brain MRI abnormalities, fever, headache, and stroke.

Previous studies have suggested that IL-4 and IL-10 were 2 cytokines that have a relationship to encephalitis [15\u201317,37]. Initially, we found during this study that the A allele, and GA, AA, and GA + AA genotypes in IL-4 rs2227288 were risk factors for virus-induced encephalitis. According to Anovazzi et al., there were strong relationships between the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of IL-4 gene polymorphisms and chronic periodontitis [38]. It was suggested that the IL-4-590 T/T and IL-4-33 T/T genotypes were potentially correlated with resistance to therapy in hepatitis C virus patients, and the CT/TT genotypes of IL-4 C-589T was correlated with wheezing without actually having a cold in African Americans infants [39,40]. The etiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and elevated risk for SLE were revealed as having correlations with IL-4 gene in a previous study [41], and another study indicated that the IL-4-590 C/T polymorphisms might participate in controlling parasitemia and the result could affect the severity of malaria [42]. Promoter polymorphisms of IL-4, an immune-regulatory Th2 cytokine, were proposed as being related to T2DM and might play a role in the susceptibility to T2DM [43]. Furthermore, IL-4 polymorphisms potentially contribute to evaluation of severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and IL-4-590 promoter polymorphism might be correlated with elevated risk and increased activity of RA [44]. An SNP of IL-4 rs2243250 was demonstrated as being correlated with increased risk of development of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [45].",

IL-10 rs1800872 polymorphism might be a risk factor for colorectal cancer development in European populations and the A/C allele of IL-10 rs1800872 might raise the risk for RA [46,47]. Previous studies have revealed that polymorphisms in IL-10-592C/A (rs1800872) were associated with risk of acute myeloid leukemia and enhanced the likelihood of early-onset preeclampsia [48,49]. IL10-592C/A polymorphisms were correlated with risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD). Additionally, the A allele may be a risk factor for CHD [50]. Polymorphisms of IL-10 rs1800872 were recorded in order to draw links and data-related correlations with the increased production of IL-10 protein in peritoneal fluid (PF) in endometriosis patients [51].
