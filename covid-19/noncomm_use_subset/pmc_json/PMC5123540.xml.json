The research findings showed that cancer-related fatigue was prevalent among such patients and that it had an adverse effect on their QoL. Effective symptom-relieving interventions were suggested, such as an exercise program to reduce the fatigue. The findings were very useful as they provided a clear indication to nurse clinicians that an exercise program should be delivered to benefit these patients by relieving their symptoms. However, because of the long process involved in an intervention study, nurse specialist could not let patients wait for such a long time before receiving the intervention. Ultimately, an exercise program was developed without tested.",

Based on the admission data of the previous year, they estimated that the intervention and data collection would last for 3-4 months. However, data collection was started in 2003, just before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At that time, all research studies were suspended because of safety issues, and all healthcare professionals and academics worked together to combat SARS. Ultimately, the whole intervention and data collection process were resumed after the SARS outbreak, and it took a whole year for complete data to be collected. Although the duration of the whole research process was much longer than expected, the project was completed and the educational program continued to be delivered after the study.",

The results also showed that when survivors\u2019 health information needs were met, their psychological needs could also be addressed and, in turn, their QoL improved. The findings identified the existing service gap and a new intervention, including needs assessment and education, was recommended to bridge that gap. Based on the findings of the study, the author and her research team proposed a research study to develop a supportive care intervention and to examine its feasibility. However, the nurse clinicians had reservations about becoming involved in the intervention and research study because it might impose an additional workload on top of their existing responsibilities. In addition, their usual practice, the routine appointment, and consultation schedule might also be interrupted. Moreover, new services for cancer survivors are not a priority in the allocation of extra resources in hospital settings. Ultimately, the proposal to develop and test an evidence-based supportive care intervention for cancer survivors could not be proceeded with.",

This was a good opportunity for the team to conduct community-based research and identify the health needs of an underserved community. Throughout the research process, there were many challenges to be faced, such as accessing eligible subjects and recruiting data collectors able to speak the ethnic minorities\u2019 mother languages. However, during the process, the research team gained opportunities to develop a strong network of various community centers and ethnic minority associations. With the development of these good relationships, a group of data collectors were eventually trained. What is more, they made new friends among the ethnic minorities and enjoyed many opportunities to learn their culture, their health needs and what kind of health promotion strategies they found acceptable and effective.",

While they were worrying whether they could complete the project with a limited budget, they received a call a few months later to submit a proposal to another funding source. They were eventually successful in obtaining the funding and received enough extra resources from the two agencies to develop two multimedia interventions for ethnic minority women, one concerned with breast cancer prevention, and the other with cervical cancer prevention.
