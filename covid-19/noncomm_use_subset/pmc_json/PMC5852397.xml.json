            "text": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease characterized by relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation in the colon[1]. About 15%-25% of all UC patients experience at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization[2]. Severe UC (SUC) is a potentially life-threatening condition which is defined as six or more bloody stools per day plus at least one of the following of Truelove and Witts\u2019 criteria: Fever (temperature > 37.8 \u00b0C); tachycardia (pulse rate > 90 bpm); anemia (hemoglobin \u2264 75% of normal); and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR > 30 mm/h)[2,3]. Intravenous corticosteroid remains the first-line therapy for SUC, having been reported to reduce the mortality rate from 24% to 7%[4,5]. However, 30%-40% of patients have disease which is steroid-refractory, requiring more invasive treatment[6,7]. The overall colectomy rate in SUC patients is higher than 30%, according to a cohort study[8]. However, in cases that fail to response to steroid therapy [stool frequency >8 stools/d, or 3-8 stools/d together with a C-reactive protein (CRP) > 45 mg/L on day 3], the colectomy rate is 85%[9]. Salvage therapy with either infliximab or cyclosporin appears to improve clinical outcomes for cases of steroid therapy failure in randomized controlled trials[10]. Patients who do not respond to intensive medical therapy or with severe complications including toxic megacolon, perforation and severe hemorrhage should be considered for timely surgery. Delayed surgery is associated with increased mortality and a higher risk of postoperative complications[11,12]. Therefore it is of paramount importance to assess the response to therapy regularly, using standardized criteria, and to initiate optimal therapy options promptly. Above all, effective management of SUC remains a great challenge.",

            "text": "China and other Asian countries are experiencing an increasing incidence and prevalence of UC[13]. A long-term follow-up study from Hong Kong reported a sixfold increase in the incidence of UC (from 0.3 per 100000 in 1986-1988 to 1.8 per 100000 in 2004-2006)[14]. Wang et al[15] analyzed 3100 UC patients hospitalized in 23 hospitals in mainland China from 1990-2003, and noted a steady increase in the number of cases. 21.7% of these patients (654/3100) were identified as severe. Bibliometric analyses and literature reviews of scholarly publications in Chinese periodical databases provide more epidemiological information. For example, a comprehensive search of the Chinese Biomedical Literature database retrieved 3384 articles relating to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) published in Chinese medical journals between 1989 and 2013, in which 140114 cases of UC were reported with the number of reported cases steadily increasing annually[16]. According to Jiang et al[17], there were 1560 Chinese papers regarding UC published from 1981 to 2000 where 10218 patients with UC were reported. Given this dramatic increase in UC, further database surveys and publication analyses are required to collate the available information about the recent epidemiology and treatment efficacy of UC and SUC in China.",

For example, according to Ouyang et al[18], articles of basic research on IBD in China rapidly increased and predominantly focused on immunological mechanisms. Moreover, bibliometric analysis of indicators including publication output and research complexity is widely used to assess the performance of the research programs of institutions and/or countries[19,20]. As mentioned above, China has witnessed an increasing incidence and prevalence of UC. Furthermore, China\u2019s population accounts for 20% of the total world population. A comprehensive study of the quantity and quality of SUC-related Chinese publications is desperately needed. This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis to determine the temporal trends in the number of Chinese publications on UC and SUC between 2001 and 2015, and to assess the SUC research performance. This study also aims to provide a review of the data on treatment type and efficacy in SUC patients that has been reported in Chinese medical journals. In addition, such a study can more broadly provide insight into improving UC and SUC treatment worldwide.",

Above all, the severity of UC was judged according to Truelove and Witts\u2019 criteria in these Chinese hospitals, consistent with the criteria applied in Western countries.",

The Oxford index, also known as the Travis index, was developed in 1996 and has been validated in cohort studies. According to this index, patients with a stool frequency of more than 8 per day, or 3-8 stools per day plus an elevated CRP (> 45 mg/L) at day 3 of corticosteroid therapy, have a 85% chance of colectomy. The Swedish index is calculated using the algorithm: \u201cnumber of stools per day + 0.14 x CRP (mg/L)\u201d, with scores > 8 indicating a high risk of requiring colectomy. The Edinburgh index is also known as the Ho score, in which scores for stool frequency (1-4 points), hypoalbuminemia < 3 mg/dL (1 point) and radiological evidence of colonic dilation (4 points) are summed, and scores greater than 4 are predictive for failure of corticosteroid therapy and subsequent need for colectomy. The Seo index is calculated using the mathematical formula: \u201c60 x frequency of bloody stool + 13 x bowel movements + 0.5 x ESR (mm/h) - 4 x hemoglobin (g/dL) - 15 x albumin (g/dL) + 200\u201d; where scores greater than 200 predicting the need for colectomy.

The number of publications about UC and SUC both experienced a significant increase over the 15 year study period. This temporal change is similar to the trends in IBD publications archived in PubMed between 1993 and 2011, as reported by Weintraub et al[25]. This may be attributable to the increased prevalence of UC, improved diagnostic methods, physician awareness of the disease, increased interest, and the spread of internet access[26,27]. Accompanied with the increasing output of SUC research, we also observed a significant increase in the number of analytical studies and clinical trials, which are more complex in study designs and are stronger in terms of the strength of evidence than descriptive studies[20]. Above all, this study has demonstrated that there has been a significant increase in publication output and research complexity on SUC in Chinese scholarly journals.

It is assumed that the indications of surgery are more conservative in China than in Western Countries such as the United Kingdom[22]. Lower colectomy rates were also reported in UC cohorts in other Asian countries like Japan and Korea[26,28]. The most commonly employed operation was total proctocolectomy with IPAA since it avoids the requirement for a permanent stoma, has a lower risk of disease recurrence and/or rectal carcinoma, and has excellent long-term functional results with good quality of life[33]. However, almost 20% of patients experienced pouch failure due to pouchitis or pouch dysfunction after IPAA[33]. The incidence of pouchitis ranged from 7.7% to 50% as reviewed in this study. According to our data, the short-term mortality rate of SUC is 0.8%, lower than the 1.2% reported in western countries[15,28]. These results are consistent with that reported by Wang et al[16], who observed a relatively milder clinical course and lower rate of complications in Chinese UC patients. UC is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The severity of histological inflammation correlates with colorectal cancer risk[34]. The incidence of colorectal cancer among SUC patients is 0.13% in our study, lower than the values of 0.4% and 3%-5% reported by Wang et al[15] and in western studies respectively. Further studies are required to confirm the hypothesis that Asian UC patients have a milder disease course and a lower risk of colectomy, colorectal cancer, and mortality.",

This might be due to the fact that biological agents such as infliximab was approved just a few years ago in China, and this kind of medication is so expensive that some patients who met the indications could not afford it. This situation may be changed with the passage of time and the development of economy. As discussed above, biological agents have been prescribed more frequently in the last two years than before.",

The relatively few publications into salvage therapy suggest that more research into the efficacy of treatment with cyclosporin or infliximab in Chinese SUC patients is required. We reported a male predominance in SUC incidence and a lower colectomy rate in Chinese SUC patients compared to western countries based on literature review.
