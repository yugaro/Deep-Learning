            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by the PED virus (PEDV), is highly contagious and lethal in piglets. The disease is characterized by clinical signs such as diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and dehydration, with high mortality in neonatal piglets [123]. PED was first reported in England in 1971 [4], after which the virus was identified as coronavirus-like strain CV777 in Belgium in 1978 [5]. Subsequently, PED has occurred in many swine-producing countries in Europe and Asia and has had a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry over the past three decades. Since the late 1990s, several PEDV vaccines have been commercialized in Asian countries as part of a comprehensive approach to disease prevention, because the clinical impact of PEDV is more acute and severe in Asia than in Europe [6]. Although the use of commercial vaccines may have led to a decline in the prevalence of the disease, the vaccines do not induce complete protection against the current epidemic PEDV strains in newborn piglets [7].",

Among the structural proteins, the S protein is a type I glycoprotein present on the surface of virions that plays an important role in virus attachment to cell receptors, and it is a target for induction of neutralizing antibodies, as it harbors virus-neutralizing epitopes [101112]. In addition, the S protein is associated with adaptation of viruses to growth in cell culture and attenuation of PEDV virulence in the natural host [13]. Therefore, the S protein of PEDV has been the subject of sequence diversity investigations aiming to understand the genetic and phylogenetic relationships of PEDV isolates and the epidemic status of PEDV in the field.",

In Korea, severe acute diarrhea outbreaks associated with a high mortality rate (approximately 100%) occurred in neonatal piglets in the beginning of November 2013 [15]. Subsequently, the 2014 PED epidemics affected over 33,600 piglets at 169 pig farms (https://www.kahis.go.kr/), despite implementation of a national PEDV vaccination program to prevent the disease on pig farms. The field isolates responsible for this PEDV epidemic are genetically and antigenically different from the PEDV vaccine strains [1416]. Therefore, the recent severe PED epidemics have emphasized the importance of establishing effective disease prevention nationwide, which requires development of next-generation vaccines against PEDV.",

To assess whether the PEDV QIAP1401 variant had emerged after sequential passaging, the genome sequence was compared with that of U.S. PEDV strains. The PEDV QIAP1401-p70 isolate had > 99.4% sequence homology to the USA/Iowa303/2014, USA/Minnesota250/2014 and OH1414 U.S. PEDV strains. However, we identified 42 amino acid (aa) mutations, including a 25 aa deletion, in the ORF1a gene of the QIAP1401-p70 isolate (Fig. 1A). To determine at which passage the deletion arose, viral RNA isolated from each passage was screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using ORF1a-specific PCR primers. The results showed that the deletion mutant emerged after 41 passages (Fig. 1B). The deletion mutation detected at passage 37 was present during the following three passages. Moreover, viral stock at passages 37 to 40 contained both parental and mutant viruses.",

To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the whole genome of QIAP1401-p70 by next-generation sequencing. Compared with reference G2b genogroup PEDVs, the adapted QIAP1401-p70 genome harbored mutations in genes encoding structural and nonstructural proteins. Among these mutations, the most remarkable was a 25 aa deletion in the ORF1a region of the nonstructural protein. We hypothesized that this 25 aa deletion reduced the duration of the replication cycle of QIAP1401-p70.

Our findings support use of growing pigs as an alternative experimental model for assessment of the protective efficacy of inactivated PEDV vaccines in pregnant sows and neonatal piglets. Therefore, our results may be used to reduce the risk of failure in future clinical trials of PEDV vaccines. Maternally derived lactogenic immunity (IgG and IgA) plays an important role in protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV infection [20]. Thus, future studies should assess the effect of vaccinating sows with our novel inactivated PEDV vaccine on neonatal piglets.",
