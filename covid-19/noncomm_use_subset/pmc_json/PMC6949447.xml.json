In 4 of the 6 patients, NIs were started without corticosteroids (from the 5th, 8th, and 11th day after the onset of symptoms). NIs were effective in 2 of 3 patients. In the other patient, however, NI was administered from the 11th day after onset, but the patient showed early treatment failure and was switched to corticosteroid therapy from the 14th day, which was effective. In 7 patients who did not receive NIs, 6 received corticosteroid therapy (which was effective) from the 11th, 19th, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, and 47th day, respectively, after the onset of symptoms. The pulmonary shadows of the two other patients who did not receive corticosteroids or NIs improved spontaneously during follow-up. Among the 40 patients suffering from viral pneumonia due to non-influenza viruses, corticosteroids with antibiotics were administered to 21 patients from a median of 15 (range, 6-45) days after the onset of symptoms. Two of these patients died. Corticosteroid therapy was effective in one of these patients; however, this patient experienced repeated episodes of aspiration pneumonia causing their condition to deteriorate until their death. The other patient showed early and late treatment failure with corticosteroid therapy, causing the progressive deterioration of the patient's condition until their death. The other 19 patients received antibiotics without corticosteroids and all survived.",

Nasopharyngeal RDTs in 10 patients with primary influenza viral pneumonia were all negative in our study, which was supported by the low sensitivity of nasopharyngeal RDTs in the 2009 pandemic (12). We did not perform RDTs using BALF; however, PCR tests using BALF were useful and are recommended for the diagnosis of primary influenza viral pneumonia. Some of our study patients had positive PCR results that were considered to indicate colonization. In previous adult studies, viruses were detected in 0.4-4.2% of asymptomatic patients (13-16). Differentiating infection and colonization is still difficult using PCR methods; thus, physicians should not diagnose patients as having a viral infection based on PCR results alone.",

Regarding the treatment of viral infections other than influenza virus, immunoglobulin therapy (pegylated interferon-alpha2A) for rhinovirus, the potential efficacy of palivizumab for RSV, ribavirin (a guanosine analogue) therapy for RSV and hMPV, and cidofovir (the nucleoside analogue of cytidine monophosphate) for adenovirus infection have been reported (26).

Second, this study was carried out in a single center, and the results may not be applicable to other settings. It is noteworthy that our institution has about 10 specialist physicians licensed by the Japan Respiratory Society. These physicians judged the need for BAL, and thus, there was bias in terms of the patients who underwent BAL. In addition, the requirement for hospitalization was a major criterion for entry into this study. This could potentially induce a spectrum bias in which only the most severe cases were enrolled in the study. Third, there may be incorporation bias in that the review panel determined that the final diagnosis was more likely to classify cases as viral pneumonia when fever and sore throat were present. Fourth, we did not investigate antibody titers against viruses in the acute and convalescent phases; thus, the number of cases of viral pneumonia might have been underestimated (32). Fifth, the multidisciplinary diagnoses were made without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in most cases; thus, the pathological findings may not have been fully evaluated. Sixth, some viral infections may have been missed in this study because only a limited number of viruses were screened in the assay. Finally, the possibility of detecting viruses from the upper respiratory tracts cannot be denied when using the BAL technique. To avoid this concern, a well-designed, prospective study is needed in which samples are obtained only from the lower respiratory tract, for example, via intubation or with the use of a protected specimen brush.",
