FIPV excreted\nfrom cats with FIP may infect other cats through the oral route. However, orally inoculated\ntype I FIPV mostly does not cause FIP in cats [11].\nIt has been difficult to explain these contradictory facts. It was clarified that even FIPV\nnot causing FIP through oral infection may cause FIP in anti-type I FCoV-seropositive cats.\nHowever, not all anti-FIPV seropositive cats develop FIP. For example, ADE is not promoted\nand the virus is neutralized in cats with a high anti- FIPV neutralizing antibody level\n[7]. FIP also does not develop when cellular\nimmunity is strongly induced after FIPV infection [12]. Based on these findings, to elucidate the clinical state of FIP, it is\nnecessary to analyze the status of immunity in cats after viral infection. However, many\nrecent studies on FIP do not focus on the host but focus on the virus. We suggest that FIP\nis a \u201cmulti-causal disease\u201d involving various risk factors (virulence of FCoV, the status of\nimmunity in host, and the route of virus infection etc.).",
