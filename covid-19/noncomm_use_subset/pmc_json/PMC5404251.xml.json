However, at present, a significant proportion of the supplies and equipment in the stockpile is nearly out-of-date and not in accordance with current medical standards or practices. Therefore, the Canadian government is working on new strategies to solve the issue of the high maintenance cost. For instance, the \u201cmini-clinics\u201d program was designed as a concept of portable, modular, and flexible medical emergency response delivery. This pre-positioning of \u201cmini-clinics\u201d aims to supplement existing medical care facilities that might be overwhelmed in a disaster.",

Two key strategies are: (1) the development of a fully costed model for shelf-life extension, and (2) the examination of options for stock cycling or rotation. The advantages of stock cycling or rotation are to minimize waste and storage and disposal costs and to reduce the need for regular replenishment. Currently, the Australian Department of Health is implementing the policy of stock rotation through suppliers for some antibiotics and P2 respirators, and a 10% to 15% rotation rate of P2 respirators was made possible. However, it is estimated that the savings for P2 respirators and antibiotic rotation over 10 years would be less than 1%.15",

However, manufacturers and suppliers often cannot meet the surge demand because of difficulties in material preparation, insufficient production capacity, and global panic buying. The discrepancy between the supply and demand directly affects protection measures for the frontline healthcare and epidemic prevention workers, causing fear and reduced workplace efficiency. After the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan CDC proposed \u201cA Strategy Plan for PPE Minimum Stockpile\u201d and established the 3-tier stockpiling framework\u2014a central health authority (managed by the Taiwan CDC), local health authorities, and medical institutions\u2014to effectively respond to emergent demands and spread the risk of stockpiling. We have also formulated a minimum stockpile for each tier, taking into consideration: (1) the protective properties of PPE; (2) the consumption of PPE during nonepidemic and epidemic periods; (3) the production capacity of the manufacturers; (4) potential alternatives; and (5) the lead time. In addition, the amount of PPE required for nationwide medical care, border quarantine, and epidemic prevention during the early phase of an outbreak was estimated. In 2003, the nationwide minimum stockpile of PPE included 3 million N95 respirators, 1.5 million coveralls, and 25 million surgical masks. In 2006, the nationwide minimum stockpile was adjusted to 2 million N95 respirators, 800,000 coveralls, and 7 million surgical masks, with half of them stockpiled in medical institutions and a quarter of them in the central and local health authorities, respectively.",

In addition, 24 million surgical masks were stockpiled by Taiwan CDC for public needs and price stabilization.17",

In this model, the central health authority is regarded as a large reservoir of stocks, and the local health authority and medical institutions are regarded as small reservoirs. The concept is to combine the replacement of the large reservoir with the consumption of small reservoirs. The oldest stockpile of the large reservoir is regularly replaced and immediately replenished with the same amount of PPE by private contractors. Meanwhile, the removed stock is circulated into small reservoirs for routine and emergency demand through the joint electronic procurement platform run by the contractors. Through this replacement model, the stockpile continuously flows through the large reservoir to small reservoirs, and we ensure the PPE stockpile in the central health authority is available in appropriate quantities and within the expiry date.",

The validity period of the released items from the central stockpile is about 2\u00bd years on average, and that of the replenished new products is 5 years. During nonepidemic periods, rotating PPE stock to the market through this model is helpful in maintaining the freshness and amount of the central stockpile required for epidemic preparedness. During an epidemic emergency, the PPE stockpile in the central inventory can be released immediately to support nationwide epidemic prevention work, stabilize the balance of supply and demand, and prevent panic buying. The 30-day inventory in medical institutions also assures healthcare workers' safety and improves the effectiveness of epidemic response.",

The service fee for N95 respirators is only 46% of the original price; therefore, it is estimated that a total of NT$3.55 million is saved over a 4-year contract.

In addition, the Taiwan CDC actively participated in international cooperation and humanitarian aid by donating 100,000 coveralls and 100,000 surgical masks from the stockpiling system to West African countries during the Ebola epidemic in 2014. In response to the avian flu epidemic in 2015 in Taiwan, the Taiwan CDC also immediately provided 128,500 coveralls, 147,040 N95 respirators, and 152,000 surgical masks to support the Taiwan Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) as emergency supplies. Through these epidemic events, we have demonstrated our stockpile system to be a reliable and useful tool for domestic emergency response and international cooperation.",

It may prove difficult to quickly obtain the PPE from these manufacturers overseas if a global large-scale epidemic occurs in which every country attempts to make a large purchase. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan has supported domestic production of surgical masks and N95 respirators for emergency demand. Support for domestic production of coveralls might depend on further cost-effectiveness evaluation and discussion among various government departments.",

In the future, we will continuously improve our system by reviewing the operational outcomes of these contracts and evaluating the potential needs for different categories of PPE in response to various infectious diseases.",
