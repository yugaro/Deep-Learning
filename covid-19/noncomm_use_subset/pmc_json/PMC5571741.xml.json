For example, according to Kumar, Fan and Melzer-Lange, in East and Southeast Asia under two SARS outbreaks, losses amounted to between US$12.3billion and US$28.4 billion[4]. The novel avian influenza A (H7N9), a new emergency infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans [5] and initially reported in China in March, 2013 has had large economic impacts of H7N9 including over $6.5 billion lost in the agriculture sector due to changes in prices, consumer confidence and trade volumes[6]. The stock market is sensitive to economic indicators and is widely used as a proxy for economic performance[7]. Thus, huge economic losses attributed to H7N9 could be expected to be spontaneously reflected in stock markets in effects.",

Moreover, Tobias Preis, et al. evaluated a quantification relationship between changes in Google query volumes for search terms related to finance and changes in stock market prices[9]. When news f disasters breaks, economists report sharp stock price declines especially when the perceived repercussions are large such as immediately after the 9/11 events and their effect on U.S. markets and the Fukushima nuclear leak on markets in Japan. However, to our knowledge, there is no research attempting to discuss the correlation between stock market prices and potential disasters stemming from emerging infectious diseases. This paper attempts to go some way in correcting this gap by detecting whether H7N9 outbreaks in China affected stock markets in China.",

Hence, the behavior of the Chinese stock market is more likely to be reflective of individual decision making and thought processes. If we assume that any individual investor makes investment decisions based on their mood in a certain extent, and this mood is affected by events like infectious disease outbreaks, then we can assume that the Chinese stock market, given that investors are new and inexperienced with unrealistic expectations about stock market investments[11], is likely to be more heavily impacted by changes in the mood because of the news. Thus, we can expect that news of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease like H7N9, together with overly negative emphasis through government warnings or sensationalist news reporting will encourage people to form a negative belief before it can be testified, according to the psychology study. Our hypothesis is that following this initial negative stage, the market will then trend downwards according to the \u201cModel of Herd Behavior\u201d before recovering to the normal price according to the \u201creturn to the central \u201d theory[12], as people gain better information and normalize their opinion on the true effect of the outbreak.",

Within each space, natural cubic spline is used to get a flexible fit. Then, in order to get a better fit in the range of the reported number, the knots were placed at equally spaced percentile of the asymptotically Poisson distributed values of reported number. For the dimension of the lags, suggested by previous studies, we put the knots at equal intervals in the logarithmic scale of lags to allow more flexibility in the first part of the distributed lag curve, where more variability is expected[13].

The daily reported number of H7N9 cases was also significantly associated with the closing price of the Avian Influenza Sector Index. Moreover, the trend of the predicted effect on this sector index was contrary to the Overall Market Index (Shanghai Composite Index). One plausible explanation is that the emergency measurements taken by local governments to deal with H7N9 together with encouragement by the Chinese central government to shut down local poultry markets and slaughter existing poultry after local H7N9 reporting[15, 16], meant that a majority of people were less likely to consume poultry products due to a perceived threat of infection. There was also a corresponding hit on poultry breeding and slaughtering enterprises, most of which are large listed companies with large market shares. However, shutting down poultry markets is not a standard control measure in fighting a H7N9 outbreak and because of this, not all local governments have adapted closing markets as a standard response measure. As such, there was variation in responsiveness and speed at which different governments responded at the market level.",

Compared with the United States where investors usually hire financial advisers to manage their investments and attain feedback on stock performance[10], the Chinese stock market is far less mature and includes large numbers of individual investors who lack professional information and guidance and are quite often easily influenced by mass media reporting. Indeed, after experiencing the SARS outbreak in China, a majority of Chinese people fear H7N9 especially given the perception that it is a new emergency infectious disease with a high human fatal rate[5], and with the potential to cause a severe epidemic or pandemic. Given mass media reporting that often indicates that humans infected by H7N9 virus from poultry are often in mortal danger, shareholders tend to selling off related stock without rational thinking.",

However, whenever the daily number of reported cases was between five and 33, the index rose as the reported case numbers also rise. In this regards, behavioral economic studies have indicated that negative sentiment driven by pessimism and anxiety affects investment decisions which may also affect asset pricing[17, 18]. Given H7N9 outbreaks generate pessimism and anxiety, H7N9 would also affect investment decisions and hence asset prices. This is then amplified by so called herd behavior which can explain the rapid fall of stock prices at the initial stage of H7N9 reporting[19, 20]. On top of that, the \u201creturn to the central\u201d theory[12] can also be used to explain that in latter stages of the outbreak, prices slowly return to the normal as people reevaluate the potential damage downward and begin to push asset prices back up.",

Using this theory are a basis for our conclusions, we predict that an outbreak of human avian influenza A(H7N9) in China must necessarily lead to increased stock market demand for related industries such as biomedicine, biological products and Chinese traditional medicine. As such, we would also expect that related sector indices would increase because of the demand and due to the overall investment psychology of domestic Chinese investors. However, our results showed that the sector indices for biomedicine, biological products and Chinese traditional medicine actually decreased with the increasing number of daily reported cases. One plausible explanation is that even though H7N9 is still being reported, investors recognize that the outbreak does not have the potential to create an international pandemic that would warrant a significant increase in biomedical expenditure. They are also less likely to be aware of the outbreak or give it much attention because the scale of infection is nowhere near that seen with pdm A (H1N1) in 2009. As such, total change in demand for stocks in these indexes remains small with net effects on prices due to a H7N9 outbreak also expected to be small.",
