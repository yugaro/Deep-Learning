            "text": "In the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations have a significant impact on mortality,1 especially in those who require hospital admission. Indeed, exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as the severity of COPD increases.2 Although exacerbations have multiple causes, an infectious etiology is by far the most frequent, with figures up to 78% for hospital-admitted COPD patients.3 Bacterial infections account for one-half of the acute episodes, while respiratory viruses are identified in more than one-quarter, with rhinovirus (RV) and influenza being the most commonly detected viral pathogens. Microbiological studies have identified change in sputum color and purulence as good surrogate markers for bacterial infection,4,5 while the detection of viruses in exacerbations is only marginally associated with the appearance of changes in the characteristics of sputum.6,7 Both respiratory bacteria and viruses are able to produce major local and systemic inflammatory responses, and biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) have been extensively studied and used as an alternative test to diagnose bacterial infections in both COPD and pneumonia.8,9 Likewise, in stable COPD, CRP levels have been examined as a marker of bacterial colonization and/or subclinical infection10 but in studies of exacerbated COPD patients, including viral etiology, they have proven unable to distinguish virus-associated exacerbations from others.7 In fact, a recent study by Clark et al demonstrated a higher level of CRP in exacerbations due to viruses than in those with positive cultures for bacteria.11",

The present results confirm that bronchial infections due to H. influenzae have a clear systemic effect in severe COPD patients, as measured by CRP levels in peripheral blood, equivalent to the effect found in S. pneumoniae-related exacerbations. This finding is clinically significant, because H. influenzae is the most prevalent cause of exacerbation in these patients; infections by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the cause of nearly one-half of the episodes. In contrast, virus detection was associated with lower CRP levels and severity. Our results are at odds with those of previous studies that have reported higher levels of serum CRP in patients with virus-induced exacerbations.6,11 The differences are probably due to the characteristics of the episodes reported here, consisting of exacerbations that appear in the follow-up of a cohort of severe COPD outpatients.

The prevalence of viral infections was significantly lower. Systemic inflammation identified through CRP blood levels was higher in bacterial infections, mainly when H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the cause, and high figures for this inflammatory biomarker were related to the severity of the episode. The findings suggest that CRP blood levels may be a useful biomarker in the management of exacerbations appearing in these severe patients.",
