After questioning husbandry staff it was discovered that the cat drank more water and soiled its litterbox to a greater degree than other research cats since arrival from a commercial vendor 4 months earlier. Prior to arrival, the cat was housed in a closed barrier facility and tested to be SPF for the following agents: feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, feline panleukopenia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis, feline leukemia virus, feline coronavirus, feline chlamydia, toxoplasmosis and rabies. The cat was up to date on vaccinations (Rabvac 3, Fel-O-Vax PCT; Boehringer Ingerheim) and was fed a commercial feline diet (Adult Light Dry; Hill\u2019s Science Diet) once daily. Research manipulations were not yet performed on the cat, which was housed in a climate-controlled room with five other research cats, each with their own 58 cm \u00d7 36 cm \u00d7 74 cm enclosure. All enclosures were equipped with an elevated resting board, two hide boxes, various enrichment toys and a litterbox with corncob litter (Bed-O\u2019Cobs; Andersons). Cats could visualize each other at all times and received at least 15 mins of play time per day outside of their enclosures to allow for cleaning and litter removal.",

In contrast to CDI, AVP is present in normal or increased amounts.4 NDI can be primary (familial) or secondary (acquired) in dogs; however, no cases of primary NDI have been reported in cats.2,13 Secondary NDI is caused by renal or metabolic disorders that interrupt the normal interaction of AVP with its tubular receptors in the kidney, disrupt renal tubular function or result in loss of the hypertonic renal medullary interstitial gradient.4 Several diseases, such as hyperadrenocorticism,17 pyometra,18 pyelonephritis,4 hyperthyroidism19 and hyperaldosteronism20 can lead to secondary NDI in the cat. With NDI there should be minimal-to-no improvement in PU/PD signs and USG when desmopressin is administered or when a MWDT is performed.4 By performing diagnostic bloodwork and imaging many causes of secondary NDI were ruled out, although the lack of response in the desmopressin trial indicated NDI was still a possible diagnosis. However, the MWDT ultimately ruled out primary and secondary NDI as the cat was able to concentrate urine above 1.035, proving adequate renal responsiveness to AVP.",

The underlying physiological disorder with dipsogenic diabetes insipidus appears to be an osmotic threshold for thirst that is abnormally low. Yet not only is the thirst threshold low in affected patients, but also for unknown reasons the osmotic threshold for AVP release tends to be in a high normal range, causing plasma osmolality to remain at a level above that necessary to eliminate thirst but below that required to stimulate AVP release.22,23 Consequently, patients with this disease tend to drink themselves into a water diuresis. The pathogenesis of dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is unknown but is hypothesized to be due to a disruption of one or more afferent pathways that regulate the thirst and AVP osmostats.23 Lesions of the hypothalamic thirst center leading to compulsive water drinking have yet to be reported in dogs or cats.2,4 Because advanced intracranial imaging was not performed in the cat presented here, a lesion affecting this area of the brain cannot be ruled out. However, there was never an indication of underlying neurologic disease on repeated examinations and behavioral monitoring. Although some authors do not distinguish between primary and dipsogenic polydipsia, as it is not universally accepted as a distinct pathophysiologic state,22 a study by Robertson found about the same incidence of dispogenic diabetes insipidus as for NDI and psychogenic polydipsia and half of that for partial CDI in 129 human patients.23",

Treatment for dogs diagnosed with psychogenic polydipsia centers around gradual water restriction with or without the addition of salt to the diet and changes in the environment to provide additional enrichment to the dog\u2019s daily routine.2,4 When the cat presented here remained on ad libitum water and a new diet with a slightly higher sodium content was started, the first concern was that the polydipsia would continue at the same rate or even worsen. In order to prevent this from happening, additional enrichment activities were added to the cat\u2019s daily routine, as mentioned previously. Although our cat remained PU/PD with water consumption >100 ml/kg/day and urine output >50 ml/kg/day, both conditions improved to almost normal levels 2 weeks after making the enrichment modifications, and the USG increased from an average of 1.006 to an average of 1.022. Although these findings provide further evidence for the diagnosis of PP in this cat, we realize that without advanced imaging of intracranial structures and constant monitoring of plasma AVP levels to determine a threshold for release a distinction between dipsogenic diabetes insipidus and psychogenic polydipsia cannot be made in the case presented here.",

Patients with PP should have lower than normal plasma osmolality (<280 mOsm/kg) owing to increased blood volume, while those with CDI or NDI have plasma osmolality levels >280 mOsm/kg owing to the loss of free water through the kidneys and subsequent decreased blood volume.2 However, there can be considerable overlap of plasma osmolality values in animals with these three disorders. When allowed free access to water, a plasma osmolality level >300 mOsm/kg is consistent with CDI, NDI or PP, whereas levels <280 mOsm/kg would suggest PP alone.1,2,4 Plasma and urine osmolality have also been shown to vary throughout the day in dogs with PP, and both hyponatremia and normal serum sodium levels have been reported in humans and dogs with this disease.21,24 With the cat featured in this case study, serum sodium levels were always normal (RI 145\u2013158 mmol/l)6 and plasma osmolality levels were either in the normal range or elevated. As mentioned previously, human patients diagnosed with dipsogenic diabetes insipidus have an osmotic thirst threshold that is set lower than the threshold for AVP release.22,23 This could also be the case for the cat presented here. To compensate for an abnormally low thirst threshold it is thought that the kidneys of affected patients adapt a blunted response to AVP in order to protect the body against dangerous levels of hyponatremia.22 In this scenario serum sodium and plasma osmolality levels would remain normal despite compulsive drinking, but the cat could properly concentrate urine when fluid deprived during the MWDT. Robertson noted three human patients diagnosed with dipsogenic diabetes insipidus that had basal plasma osmolality and sodium levels in the upper normal range as opposed to being suppressed;23 these patients were found to have normal AVP secretion but a higher threshold for release.",

A study by van Vonderen et al. showed that four dogs previously diagnosed with PP had decreased AVP responses during a MWDT, and that two of four dogs had plasma osmolality and serum sodium levels at the upper limits of normal, indicating that a non-linear relationship between AVP and plasma osmolality levels may exist in some dogs with PP.21 Plasma osmolality and serum sodium levels that are not decreased in a PU/PD animal should not necessarily rule out PP and emphasizes the fact that multiple diagnostic tests may be needed before reaching a final diagnosis. Although helpful in diagnosing CDI in one feline case, there are no published AVP reference intervals in cats.15,25 AVP levels were not measured in our cat to determine if there was abnormal synthesis and release during the MWDT, but this is a topic that warrants further research in cats with PU/PD.",

These findings, along with improvement in clinical signs after increasing environmental enrichment, provide strong evidence that primary polydipsia was the underlying cause of the cat\u2019s chronic PU/PD and hyposthenuria.
