            "text": "Gene expression in all organisms is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription initiation, mRNA stability and turnover, translation and protein degradation. Not surprisingly, rapid changes in cell metabolism and most responses to environmental stimuli involve significant flux of many cellular RNAs, of which mRNA transcriptome profiles have been most extensively studied to date (1,2). However, also stable RNAs, such as ribosomal, transfer, nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs), are likely to undergo specific transformations in altered conditions. It has been demonstrated that certain pathways of cell death are accompanied by the destruction of nucleic acids. For example, in metazoans the programmed cell death (PCD) called apoptosis, in addition to irreversible DNA damage, which is considered an apoptotic hallmark (3), also involves specific cleavage of several RNA species, including 28S rRNA, U1 snRNA or Ro RNP-associated Y RNAs (4). It was proposed that rRNA degradation could contribute to cell autodestruction, whereas degradation of anti-apoptotic factors mRNAs would accelerate apoptosis. In higher eukaryotes, RNA cleavage is probably carried out by RNase L, a 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate-dependent endoribonuclease, which functions in RNA decay during the interferon-induced response to viral infection, and whose activation in animal cells causes apoptosis (5\u20137). However, RNase L-independent cleavage of 28S rRNA in virus infected cells has also been reported (8).",

Nevertheless, recent studies revealed the existence of cell death pathway in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and other unicellular eukaryotes, with typical hallmarks of apoptosis: DNA fragmentation, externalization of phosphatidyl serine and chromatin condensation. PCD in yeast is triggered by several different stimuli, including ageing, expression of mammalian pro-apoptotic proteins, exposure to low doses of H2O2, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and mating-type \u03b1-factor pheromone (9\u201311). Unicellular organisms are believed to undergo PCD for a variety of reasons, including elimination of old, infected and damaged cells in growth-limiting conditions for better survival of the remaining population, and adaptation of the more fit subpopulation to the ever changing and challenging environment (12).",

In addition, in both human and yeast cells, histone modifications (histone H2B phosphorylation at serine 14 in human and at serine 10 in yeast and H2B deacetylation at lysine 11 in yeast) play an important role in apoptotic chromatin condensation and cell death (19\u201321). However, several apoptotic factors are missing in yeast, including the Bcl-2/Bax family and the apoptosis protease activator factor Apaf-1. Also, there is no good homologue of RNase L to execute possible RNA degradation.

            "text": "PCD occurs via a number of different mechanisms, e.g. caspase-dependent or independent, however, in all eukaryotes it is thought to be correlated with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can either be generated exogenously through respiration or originate from exogenous sources such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anions or hydroxyl radicals. Excessive ROS results in damage of cellular components (DNA, lipids and proteins), cell cycle arrest, ageing and finally cell death (24). Cells have developed a complex network of defence mechanisms, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, against adverse consequences of oxidative stress (25). Non-enzymatic system comprises a set of small molecules acting as ROS scavengers (e.g. glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin and ascorbic acid), whereas enzymatic system eliminates oxygen radicals by the action of specialized cytosolic or mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. catalases, superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin peroxidases) (25). Most genes encoding components of these systems are induced in response to oxidative stress and are under transcriptional control of specific factors, for example Yap1, Msn2/Msn4 and Skn7 in budding yeast (26). However, it appears that there is no general oxidative stress response. In S. cerevisiae, different response pathways are triggered by specific oxidants and different genes are involved in maintaining efficient cellular resistance to various sources of ROS (1,2). Interestingly, recent genomic approaches to identify these genes showed that strains lacking proteins which function in RNA metabolism were oversensitive to oxidative stress (1,2). These included genes encoding rRNA helicases (Dbp3, Dbp7), rRNA processing factors (Nop12, Nsr1), mRNA deadenylases (Ccr4, Pop2) and several mitochondrial RNA splicing components (2,27). This indicates that RNA processing and degradation may have a role in cellular response to ROS.",

RNA degradation coincides with fragmentation of chromosomal DNA but occurs considerably earlier and most likely upstream of the activation of major apoptotic regulators, Yca1 and Aif1.

In the case of 18S, hardly any degradation intermediates were detected, there was some decay of the mature RNA, however, it was approximately 2.5 to 3-fold weaker than for the mature 25S.

Internucleosomal DNA laddering, typical for mammalian apoptosis, has not been detected during PCD in yeast; nevertheless, a higher order chromatin fragmentation to segments of several hundred kilobases also occurs in yeast (30,40). This DNA breakdown can be monitored either by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay or by using PFGE of genomic DNA. The latter approach was applied to verify which oxidative agents lead to apoptotic phenotypes. Chromosomal DNA from cells treated with H2O2 (1 mM), menadione (0.5 mM), CHP (0.2 mM), paraquat (5 mM), diamid (2 mM) and t-BHP (1 mM) for 200 min was analysed using PFGE (Figure 1D). Clear DNA degradation was observed only for cells exposed to H2O2 and menadione, other treatments did not result in a visible apoptotic fragmentation. This is in a striking agreement with rRNA degradation that occurred only in H2O2- and menadione-treated cells. This strongly indicates that rRNA decay phenotype can be related to apoptosis.",

Hyperosmotic shock was achieved by growth of exponential cells in SC complete media supplemented with 60% (wt/wt) glucose or 30% (wt/wt) sorbitol (31). And finally, chronological ageing was performed by constant growth of yeast cultures in SC complete medium for 2\u201316 days (32). This analysis revealed that all apoptotic stimuli tested resulted in the 25S and 5.8 rRNA fragmentation with the degradation pattern specific for each condition (shown in Figure 1E\u2013G for 25S in all apoptotic conditions and in Figure 1H for 5.8S during ageing). The accumulating intermediates generated by some factors were comparable (see for example, cleavages mediated by 60% glucose and 30% sorbitol, acetic acid and H2O2, Figure 1E and F); however, the general outcome of each treatment indicated differences in the course of events during each response.",

This onset of rRNA degradation distinctly precedes the timing of DNA damage characterized in apoptotic yeast exposed to the same stimuli (30), indicating that RNA decay process is activated early during the response. Also, in the case of H2O2, low doses of the oxidant, starting with 0.12 mM and optimal at 0.4\u20133 mM, were sufficient to initiate rRNA degradation with the appearance of specific bands. When high concentration of H2O2 (180 mM), believed to result in cell necrosis, was used, these specific degradation products were absent; however, the level of mature 25S and 18S rRNAs was also significantly reduced (Figure 2A; data not shown).\n",

This analysis showed the accumulation of diverse degradation products, some of which extended from the 5\u2032-end of the molecule (Figure 2A, lanes 1\u20136), whereas others were also truncated at their 5\u2032 ends (Figure 2A, lanes 25\u201330). The striking decrease in the level of the mature 25S rRNA at higher doses of the oxidant (1\u20133 mM) indicates that following specific cleavages the majority of rRNA becomes degraded, possibly by the exosome complex of 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonucleases that participates in the decay of rRNA precursors and excised transcribed spacers (41). The emergence of the characteristic cut-off in the signal at the fragment size corresponding to the position of the probe indicated that major cleavage sites are located around positions +400, +600 and +900 with respect to the 5\u2032-end of the molecule. Two of these cleavages, at positions +610\u2013611 and +398\u2013403, were mapped for treatment with 1 mM H2O2 by primer extension using primers W237 and W235 situated downstream of the expected cleavage sites (Figure 2B). Similarly, major cleavage sites were analysed in 16-day old chronologically aged cells using the same primers (Figure 2C) and mapped at positions +601\u2013602 and +478\u2013501. According to the secondary structure of the 25S rRNA taken from (42), the regions where mapped cleavages occur (shown in Figure 2B and C besides corresponding primer extension reactions) are located at unpaired nucleotides in loops or bulges. This points to the action of single-stranded RNA nucleases.",

To this end, DNA \u2018anchor\u2019 oligonucleotide (W242) was ligated with T4 RNA ligase to total RNA from untreated and treated W303 cells to prepare cDNA using a primer specific for the anchor (W243). This served as a template to amplify products containing required fragments using the same 3\u2032 primer and a 5\u2032 primer that covers the 5\u2032-end of 25S RNA starting at position +50 (W241). The ensuing PCR fragments (Figure 2D) were cloned into pGEM-Teasy and sequenced. The results of 10 sequenced clones for the cleavage at +610\u2013611 and 19 clones for the cleavage +398\u2013403 are shown in Figure 2E. In the case of the major site (cuts at positions +610\u2013611), this analysis confirms that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of this degradation product overlap (Figure 2E, lower panel), which is consistent with the endonucleolytic mechanism of the cleavage. Mapping the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends at site +398\u2013403 by primer extension and 3\u2032 RACE produced a different pattern: these ends do not match ideally but the products get progressively shorter pointing at the action of 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonucleases (Figure 2E, upper panel). The most likely candidate is the exosome, a large complex with a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonucleolytic activity involved in the processing and degradation of mRNA, rRNA and other RNA substrates (43). Mutants in the exosome core component Rrp41, the nuclear subunit Rrp6 and the cytoplasmic cofactor Ski7, were used to assess the status of the product 3\u2032 ends by a specific RNase H cleavage. This cleavage, directed by a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid between oligonucleotide W244 and a complementary region in the 25S starting at residue +271, allows higher resolution of analysed RNAs. This analysis shows that products generated at site +398\u2013403 in the exosome mutants rrp41-1 and ski7\u0394, but not in rrp6\u0394, are 3\u2032 extended and less heterogenous than corresponding fragments in the wild-type strain (Figure 2F\u2013I; data not shown). In contrast, positions of cleavages at site +610\u2013611 are not affected by mutations in the exosome (Fig. 2F\u2013II). This suggests that the cytoplasmic exosome may contribute to rRNA decay by digesting 3\u2032 ends of at least some cleavage products.",

Nevertheless, a similar approach had been used to demonstrate that DNA damage in apoptotic yeast cells was an enzymatic process (30). Also, in the case of RNA, the appearance of specific H2O2-induced degradation products was prevented by fixation, although the overall level of rRNA was reduced.

In addition, the ectopic expression of murine Bcl-xL protein of the anti-apoptotic mammalian Bcl-2 family, known to have a protective effect against ROS in yeast (45,46), also strongly safeguarded the 25S rRNA from rapid degradation by H2O2 (Figure 4B). In contrast, expression of the mammalian pro-apoptotic Bax protein that increases ROS level (36,47), additionally enhanced the degradation phenotype (Figure 4C). This confirms the direct correlation between the production of ROS and the fate of cellular nucleic acids, leading not only to DNA but also rRNA damage and destruction of ribosomes.\n",

            "text": "From the data presented so far, it appears that the observed rRNA fragmentation may possibly represent a part of the cellular oxidative stress and apoptotic responses. This was assessed by testing the extent of the 25S rRNA degradation in different mutants defective in these pathways. In the first place, yca1\u0394 strain, lacking the only identified apoptotic metacaspase Yca1 in yeast, and aif1\u0394 cells not expressing the yeast apoptosis inducing factor Aif1 (13,15), were assayed for H2O2-induced RNA decay, however, no significant differences were observed (Supplementary Figure S1B and C). Similarly, addition of a broad-range caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (20 \u03bcM) that prevents Yca1-dependent cell death in yeast (13,48) had no effect on rRNA fragmentation (data not shown). This indicates that rRNA degradation detected in all apoptotic conditions tested is independent of the two major apoptosis mediators, Yca1 and Aif1, and of other potential yeast caspases. Likewise, treatment with translation inhibitor cycloheximide, that has been shown to prevent apoptotic cell death induced by H2O2 and acetic acid (29,36), had little or no effect on H2O2-mediated rRNA degradation (Supplementary Figure S1A). However, it appears that events in the course of apoptosis that require protein synthesis are rather late, for example DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation, whereas rRNA decay is initiated relatively fast. In contrast, different outcome was observed for mutants inhibiting chromatin condensation during H2O2-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Serine 10 and deacetylation of Lysine 11, both in histone H2B, were reported to have an essential role for the progress of cell death in yeast (20,21). In agreement, S10A or K11Q mutations in histone H2B that prevent these modifications and abrogate apoptosis resulted in the significant reduction of the 25S rRNA degradation, both the decay of the mature rRNA and the amount of degradation products (Figure 5A). Together, these data show that the destruction of ribosomal RNA in cells treated with H2O2, and possibly with other apoptotic stimuli, is a part of a yeast cell death pathway that involves histone modification and not the caspase-dependent pathway. Remarkably, Nuc1-mediated apoptosis resulting from over-expression of yeast EndoG homologue Nuc1, a major mitochondrial nuclease, was also reported to be Yca1- and Aif1-independent and related to histone modifications (18). Alternatively, it can be envisaged that damage of ribosomes triggered by apoptotic stimuli is an early event during the response, does not require protein synthesis, precedes caspase activation and acts as an upstream signal in the apoptotic pathway. This scenario is consistent with most observations so far.\n",

            "text": "As the oxidative stress in yeast proceeds through multiple pathways that involve different response mechanisms (1,2), we tested several known enzymes and factors that regulate these responses. These included two major transcription factors, Yap1 and Skn7, that control expression of several genes induced by oxidative stress and in this way participate in ROS sensing (1,26,49\u201351), as well as components of antioxidant pathways, e.g. superoxide dismutases Sod1-2, glutathione peroxidases Gpx1-3, glutaredoxins Grx1-2, peroxiredoxins Tsa1-2, Prx1, Dot5 and Ahp1, thioredoxins Trx1-2 and thioredoxin reductases Trr1-2 (24,52). These enzymes are required for protection against ROS either by catalysing the breakdown of oxidative compounds or by restoring natural intracellular redox equilibrium. In addition, as glutathion protects cells against ROS, we also used a gsh1\u0394 strain lacking a \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which, when grown on glutathion-free synthetic medium, leads to glutathion depletion and cell death (36,53). Strains lacking these proteins are more sensitive to several oxidants than their isogenic wild-types (2), and following treatment with H2O2 they showed a marked increase in the 25S rRNA degradation, however, to different degrees depending on the mutant. In Figure 5B\u2013D, yap1\u0394, skn7\u0394, gpx1/2/3\u0394, sod1/2\u0394, grx1/2-\u0394, prx\u0394 (tsa1/2\u0394/prx1\u0394/ahp1\u0394/dot5\u0394) and gsh1\u0394 strains are shown, which gave the most evident effects in comparison with their respective isogenic wild-types, particularly when considering the decay rate of the mature 25S rRNA. These data indicate that properly functioning oxidative stress response also protects cellular components such as nucleic acids from the attack by ROS and that defects at any step of this defence result in a more severe and faster breakdown. It is noteworthy that multiple anti-oxidant mutants lacking all components of each enzymatic pathway exhibit a stronger effect on the 25S degradation than single mutants, pointing to the additive protection actions of these systems. Striking effects on rRNA stability in strains lacking stress response transcription factors Yap1 and Skn7 indicate that the synthesis of new anti-oxidant proteins that are induced by oxidative stress might be required for protection of ribosomes. Consistently, blocking protein synthesis by pre-treatment with cycloheximide resulted in somehow stronger rRNA degradation (Supplementary Figure S1A, lanes 1\u20135 and 11\u201315).",

However, additional copies of rDNA present on a multicopy pNOY102 plasmid under control of the inducible GAL7 promoter (54) did not affect the amount of any mature rRNA species, possibly due to mechanisms that regulate ribosome abundance (data not shown). In contrast, the level of total genomic and plasmid-derived 18S and 25S rRNAs was, to our surprise, reduced to 70% in a strain transformed with the multicopy pJV12 plasmid expressing a tagged rDNA gene under the control of the constitutive PGK1 promoter (55), when compared to a strain transformed with vector alone (Figure 6A). The basis of this effect is unclear, particularly that it was seen even though the tagged rRNA versions were expressed as confirmed by northern blots using probes specific for plasmid borne 25S rRNA (Figure 6A). Nevertheless, the strain carrying pJV12 showed a decreased viability already in the absence of oxidant (1.6-fold) and even more strikingly reduced following treatment with different concentrations of H2O2 (4.6-fold for 0.6 mM and 6.24 for for 1 mM, respectively) relative to the strain with vector alone (Figure 6B). In another approach, we used the NOY504 strain, which carries a temperature sensitive (ts) RNA polymerase I (56). At 37\u00b0C, this strain ceases to grow but it sustains slow growth at 30\u00b0C due to reduced levels of mature rRNA. Expression of additional copies of rDNA from pNOY102 or pJV12 plasmids improves growth at all temperatures and rescues the ts-lethal phenotype (55,56). Growth of NOY504 expressing additional rDNA under the control of GAL7 (pNOY102) or PGK1 (pJV12) promoters resulted in total rRNA levels lower by 15% in the latter case (Figure 6C). This relatively modest difference in rRNA abundance led to a 10% decrease in survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress (Figure 6D).\n",

            "text": "The correlation between mitochondria and rRNA stability was assessed, in the first place, by checking rRNA level in respiratory-deficient rho0 cells lacking mtDNA in conditions inducing apoptosis, i.e. exposed to H2O2 (Figure 7A), 175 mM acetic acid (Figure 7B), hyperosmotic stress (60% glucose, Figure 7C) and during chronological ageing (Figure 7D). All treatments resulted in a remarkably robust degradation of the 25S and 5.8S rRNAs in rho0 strains when compared to the parental W303 and BY4741 strains (Figure 7, Supplementary Figure S1E; and data not shown). This points to the importance of the functioning mitochondria in the stress-induced rRNA degradation. To test the contribution of the oxidative phosphorylation, two mutants in these pathways were used, op1 with a point mutation in a major ADP/ATP carrier AAC2 (Arg96\u2192His96), and a triple aac1/2/3\u0394 deletion mutant (61) (Figure 7E). Both mutants behaved in a similar manner as rho0 cells and exhibited more pronounced rRNA degradation in the presence of H2O2 than the isogenic wild-type; however, the phenotype was stronger for op1 than upon deletion of the three carrier proteins, possibly due to a dominant negative effect in the point mutant. In addition, treatment with F0-F1 ATPase proton-pump inhibitors, oligomycin A (7.5 \u03bcg/ml) and sodium azide (NaN3, 1.5 mM) that block electron transfer and the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP (62\u201364), resulted in a moderate increase in the rRNA cleavage (Figure 7F and Supplementary Figure S1D). All these experiments indicate that the process of respiration, though generating the endogenous ROS, is also vital for counteracting its adverse effects. This was further supported by the degree of rRNA protection against oxidative damage caused by H2O2 observed for yeast cells grown on different carbon sources, which are known to affect the level of respiration (65). The most extensive RNA decay was observed in glucose, where a process called glucose repression discourages respiration. It was less pronounced in galactose and least of all in the non-fermentable source, glycerol, where mitochondrial respiration is forced (Figure 7G). These experiments directly correlate functional mitochondria and the process of respiration with the defence against oxidative stress triggered by H2O2, acetic acid, hyperosmosis and ageing that, among others, prevents destruction of cellular components, including rRNA.\n",

            "text": "It has been shown that apoptotic stimuli in yeast generate ROS that are closely correlated with the onset or progression of PCD (71). We saw that, also the degree of rRNA decay corresponded to the cellular level of ROS, which was modified by using ROS scavenger (ascorbic acid) or ectopic expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bcl-xL, respectively) known to affect ROS generation. Also, rRNA degradation was more robust in oxidative stress defence mutants, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, where intracellular ROS is not properly neutralized. All these observations argue that there is a direct link between ROS production and rRNA fragmentation. It can be envisaged that various reactive species themselves are able to produce endonucleolytic nicks in RNA molecules that will lead to breakdown, particularly as all mapped cleavages occur in single-stranded regions that constitute loops and bulges and are more accessible to chemical compounds in the solvent. However, this is not the case, given that specific RNA fragmentation did not occur in cells fixed with formaldehyde or ethanol prior to treatment with H2O2. In addition, oxidative agents used in this work generate different forms of ROS such as H2O2, hydroperoxide (LoaOOH, CHP and t-BHP), superoxide anion (menadione and paraquat) and hydroxyl free radical (produced from H2O2 or superoxide anion). Although all were applied at toxic doses, only two of them, H2O2 and menadione, mediated rRNA degradation, supporting the notion that oxidative compounds as such do not provoke cuts in RNA molecules within the cell. Taken together, this strongly suggests that active cellular machinery, such as signalling factors and RNA degrading enzyme(s), is required for this process. Nevertheless, these enzymatic activities are still to be identified. The closest yeast homologue of mammalian RNase L, Ire1, a sensor of the unfolded protein response, functions in the unconventional splicing of Hac1 pre-mRNA and contains protein kinase and endoribonuclease domains similar to those in RNase L (72). Although our unpublished data show that deletion of Ire1 has no effect on the H2O2-induced rRNA degradation (M.S. and J.K.), it does not exclude its participation in other apoptotic pathways, for example those related to endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. We are currently testing several known yeast endo- an exo-nucleases for participation in apoptosis-related rRNA degradation. Preliminary observations suggest that, contrary to expectations, this function may involve not one but a number of unspecific nucleases, including mitochondrial Nuc1p, that act in a redundant fashion (M.S. and J.K., unpublished data).",

Our results suggest that rRNA degradation phenotype most likely accompanies apoptosis, and only apoptosis-inducing oxidants result in rRNA decay, whereas cell death caused by others probably occurs via a different mechanism. Another question is why each apoptotic stimuli resulted in slightly different set of cleavage products. Those which were mapped for treatment with H2O2 and in aging cells illustrate that cleavages often occur in loops and bulges in closely located regions within the 25S rRNA, or rather within the accessible RNA elements in the compact RNP structures. The difference in cleavage patterns could be due to stress-induced subtle or severe alterations in ribosome particles that change the local accessibility of the rRNA components presented for cleavage. Alternatively, if rRNA decay is indeed carried out by more than one nuclease, these differences may reflect varying enzyme specificities in each death-inducing condition. It is also possible that somehow different set of nucleases is activated or recruited to rRNA substrates during apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress, acetic acid treatment and ageing.",

In yeast, PCD pathways triggered by acetic acid, Bax expression and pheromone, are strictly correlated with these events and do not proceed in cells devoid of mtDNA (rho0) (31,60). During chronological ageing and hyperosmotic shock, rho0 strains were reported to have somehow higher survival, which can be attributed to their long doubling time (1.5 to 2-fold), but they still die apoptotically (23,73). However, mitochondrial function is required for resistance to oxidative stress by way of detoxification or repair of the oxidative damage and, consequently, rho0 cells are more sensitive to several oxidants, have higher level of endogenous ROS and undergo apoptosis caused by H2O2 or amino-acid starvation (61,71,74\u201377). Also, mammalian rho0 cell lines undergo apoptosis in response to some but not all cell death-activating stimuli. It has been postulated that these differences may arise from a distinct mechanism by which rho0 cells maintain membrane potential by way of ATP consumption (78).",

Rho0 cells that are less resistant to oxidative stress suffer severe rRNA degradation in the presence of H2O2, acetic acid and 60% glucose and during chronological ageing. Also, impediment of oxidative phosphorylation by proton-pump inhibitors or by mutations in ATP/ADP carriers gives a similar outcome. In contrast, rRNA is markedly more stable when mitochondrial respiration is enhanced (e.g. by growth on glycerol versus glucose). This is consistent with the protective role of active mitochondria against the damaging effects of ROS on cellular components, rRNA destruction included. To begin with, several anti-oxidant enzymes localize to mitochondria and are more abundant in respiring cells. In addition, it has been proposed that some anti-oxidant activities may require energy (75).",

They may interact and function in a similar fashion as their mammalian counterparts, however, in contrast to mitochondrial mammalian proteins, Nma111 and Bir1 are located in the nucleus, so in yeast there might be some deviations from the mammalian model (13,14,71). Nevertheless, apoptotic cell-death pathways in yeast induced by H2O2, acetic acid, hyperosmotic shock, ageing and increased mRNA stability were reported to require metacaspase Yca1, nominating them as caspase-dependent pathways (13,23,31). Still, deletion of Yca1 in the mRNA turnover mutant lsm1\u0394 does not attenuate mRNA decay, placing Yca1 action downstream of the signal rising from mRNA level (23). In contrast, histone phosphorylation at Ser10, which requires prior deacetylation at Lys11, has been shown to mediate H2O2-induced apoptosis independently of Yca1 (20,21). Also, the activity of the major mitochondrial nuclease, Nuc1, in the cell-death pathway does not require either apoptotic mediators, Yca1 or Aif1, but is affected by H2B modifications (18). Moreover, two PCD pathways, namely induced by defects in protein N-glycosylation and triggered by ammonia in multicellular yeast colonies, do not rely on Yca1 but on as yet unknown caspase-like activity (79,80).",

            "text": "Degradation of the 25S/5.8S rRNAs is observed in all conditions inducing apoptosis, however, this process is not dependent on Yca1 and Aif1. On the other hand, mutations in histone H2B that inhibit phosphorylation at Ser10 and block the progress of H2O2-induced apoptosis also severely affect rRNA degradation. More importantly, rRNA degradation coincides with apoptotic DNA fragmentation; from several compounds that lead to oxidative stress and cell death, only those that provoked DNA destruction also triggered rRNA decay. Furthermore, at least some apoptotic pathways strictly require the involvement of mitochondria and do not occur in yeast lacking mtDNA, whereas rRNA degradation in all stress conditions tested is more powerful in rho0 cells. To sum up: rRNA decay induced by apoptotic stimuli occurs during cell death pathway that involves ROS generation, mitochondrial activity, fragmentation of chromosomes and histone modification but not apoptotic regulators, Yca1 and Aif1. This could be due to the existence of numerous different but partly overlapping PCD mechanisms, whether caspase- and mitochondria-dependent or independent. Ever increasing numbers of such pathways has been described in the literature in recent years. However, we favour a different model, where all these elements function in concert at different steps of the whole scenario. Stress stimuli induce signals, possibly via ROS, affecting different levels of gene expression, namely chromatin modifications, transcription and translation, which as a result activate defence response. At this level, mitochondrial respiration helps to protect cellular components via adaptive mechanisms with anti-oxidant functions. Even so, when the attack is not successfully pacified, generated ROS molecules initiate the destruction of cellular machineries, targeting in the first place crucial elements such as protein synthesis (i.e. ribosomes). Now, the progression of the response comes to the crossroads\u2014if the conditions are appropriate, the cascade of events leading to apoptosis is triggered (e.g. release of CytC and other mitochondrial factors to the cytoplasm) resulting in cell death with characteristic apoptotic markers. Alternatively, when apoptotic prerequisites are not met, cells do not enter this pathway. The more fit cells escape death, whereas others die anyway, maybe less rapidly and through a different pathway. In this scenario, certain events, including generation of ROS, histone modifications and possibly also RNA fragmentation, occur upstream of subsequent steps, such as activation of caspases and other apoptotic regulators with resulting apoptotic phenotypes.",
