Five public health facilities were randomly selected for this study, four of which had independent routine swab analysis performed by the National Surveillance Unit. A paediatric patient was a subject 12 years or below and an antibiotic was defined as a substance with bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. The term is often extended however to include synthetic antibacterial agents, not produced by microbes 24, such as sulfonamides and quinolones, which was adopted in this study. The diagnoses of URTIs for the purposes of this study are: the common cold, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, viral URTI, influenza and non-specific URTI. Exclusion criteria were (1) age equal or lower 13, (2) subjects immunocompromised, malnourished or infected by laboratory confirmed resistant strains of pathogens and chronic respiratory tract diseases and (3) a subject without a definite diagnosis of URTI. Data were analysed using Minitab version 14. 25 Data from throat swabs performed under the National Surveillance Programme conducted at four (4) of the health facilities studied were collected and used for analysis. Swabs were taken from children presenting with complaints of an upper respiratory tract infection and were obtained on the same day as the physician\u2019s visit and were independent of physician consultation. These swabs were transported in commercially available transport media to the Microbiology department of the Port of Spain General Hospital where they were initially plated on blood agar containing antibiotic strips to detect sensitivity.",

The mean ages for males and females were 1.7 [SD=1.98] and 1.8 [SD=2] years respectively, however 96.2% of cases were between 0-7 years. The most common condition diagnosed was non-specific URTI [285, 54.5 %] followed by the common cold [171, 32.7%]. Acute tonsillitis, acute otitis media and acute pharyngitis together accounted for only 8.4% of all children studied and no child had a diagnosis of sinusitis. Looking at the distribution of cases by age non-specific URTI was the most common diagnosis in patients 0-2 years [225/392, 57.4%] and 3-4 years [42/84, 50%]. In children less than 4 years the common cold [21/47, 44.7%] was most frequent. The common cold and non-specific URTI were also the only two diagnoses made in children over 9 years of age. Disease occurrence and gender were not associated except for otitis media in which 11(79%) of the 14 cases occurred in boys. Four patterns of prescribing were observed, (1) no drug therapy [10, 1.9%], (2) antibiotic therapy alone [32, 6.1%], (3) antibiotic therapy and symptomatic therapy [277, 53.0%] and (4) only symptomatic therapy [204, 39.0%]. A total of 309 [59.1%] patients received a single antibiotic; two or more antibiotics used in combination were never prescribed. Of patients diagnosed with the common cold 51.5% received an antibiotic and 58.2% of those diagnosed with a non-specific URTI received an antibiotic. Many patients (82.1%) with other diagnoses (acute tonsillitis, acute otitis media, viral URTI, influenza, and acute pharyngitis) also received an antibiotic. The most frequent antibiotics prescribed were amoxicillin [242, 78.3%], erythromycin [32, 10.4%] and amoxicillin/clavulanate [28, 9.1%]. The remaining 7 patients received different agents such as cefaclor, cefuroxime and co-trimoxazole. Irrespective of the diagnosis amoxicillin was the antibiotic of choice even among the 14 patients diagnosed with viral URTI, 4[28.6%]. In just over a third (204, 39%) of patients symptomatic therapy was recommended, one agent in 95, two in 101 and 3 in 8 patients. Both an antibiotic and symptomatic therapy were prescribed for 277 patients. Reported, 78.2% were treated with antibiotics and symptomatic agents and 6.4% were treated with an antibiotic alone The five symptomatic agents most frequently prescribed were paracetamol [40. 1%]; diphenhydramine [29. 1%]; normal saline nose drops [14.2%]; chlorpheniramine [7.3%]; and histatussin [3.1%]. There was a significant association between antibiotic prescribing and therapy for relief of symptoms [p=0.021] so that antibiotic prescription was likely to be given with a prescription for symptom relief. In 112 of the 523 cases studied throat swabs were analysed for culture and sensitivity. In 110 [98.2%] participants growth of commensals only was reported, and only two subjects had pathogenic organisms; one with streptococcus pyogenes and the other with Staphilococcus aureus. In children harbouring commensals, 52.7% were diagnosed with a non-specific URTI, and 34.8% had the common cold. In the one patient in whom Staphlococcus aureus was isolated, a diagnosis of the common cold was made, the patient received amoxicillin/clavulanate and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to ampicillin. In the patient with Streptococcus pyogenes, the child had non-specific URTI, received amoxicillin, and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to amoxicillin.",

The diagnosis of non-specific URTI\u2019s may reflect difficulty by physicians in our setting to precisely identify the diagnosis and aetiology. The recognition by physicians that bacterial URTI\u2019s are infrequent is in part due to the lack of local evidence that emphasises this feature of URTI\u2019s which in turn facilitates the misconceptions regarding antibiotics and URTI\u2019s. There were no gender differences in the occurrence of URTI except for acute otitis media in which there were more boys [78.5%] than girls [21.5%]. We find this difficult to explain as did Pukandor et al who reported similar findings.26",

Public misconceptions on the effectiveness of, and indications for, antibiotics exist. Patients presenting with an acute febrile illness often believe that infection is the problem and antibiotics is the answer. Thus patient expectations significantly influence prescribing even if the physician judges that antibiotics are not indicated. Lack of continuing medical education among primary care physicians not presently a legal requirement for continuing to practice may also contribute, as more primary care physicians are more likely to initial see these patients than paediatricians.27",

Eight of the 14 patients diagnosed with acute otitis media received amoxicillin. Any decision to treat children with acute otitis media with an antibacterial agent, requires that amoxicillin be prescribed because of its safety, low cost, acceptable taste, and narrow microbiologic spectrum.34,35 Treating influenza without established secondary bacterial infection with antibiotics has not proven beneficial36,37 yet eight of the nine patients diagnosed with influenza received antibiotics.
