Typically, siRNAs are 7 nm in length with an approximate molecular weight of 13 KDa1 and have a high net negative charge. Thus, size and charge make siRNAs unable to readily penetrate cellular membranes. Furthermore, naked siRNAs are quickly degraded by nucleases in the bloodstream, and have a short half-life of minutes in the plasma.12 Therefore, different methods have been proposed and examined to protect and deliver siRNAs with varying degrees of success.

Because an N/P ratio of at least 4 was needed to achieve complete siRNA condensation by all of our copolymers, all experiments discussed hereafter were performed using greater N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. Size and surface charge measurements are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. The diameters of P1 complexes were 128 nm, 130 nm, and 150 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The diameters of P2 complexes were 190 nm, 200 nm, and 210 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The diameters of P3 complexes were 160 nm, 152 nm, and 130 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24 (Fig. 4). The diameters of P2 complexes were larger than those of P1 and P3.The two sides of PLL may contribute to making P2 complexes less compact by entrapping many water molecules in the complexes and thus, contributing to the larger complex sizes measured. It was interesting to find that increasing the N/P ratio of P1 or P2 polymer complexes resulted in larger particles, while increasing the N/P ratio P3 polymer complexes resulted in smaller particles. Because the PPG segments are chemically attached to the PLL segments, formation of a PPG core causes dense packaging of P3-siRNA complexes. The Zeta potential analyses are provided in Figure 5. The Zeta-potentials of P1 complexes were 28 mv, 29 mv, and 31 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes range were 44 mv, 46 mv, and 52 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. Finally, the Zeta-potentials of P3 complexes were 19 mv, 20 mv, and 22 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes were greater than those of P1 and P3. It was interesting that P2 complex has greater potential but lower siRNA binding ability. A possible reason is that the larger surface areas coupled with lower siRNA binding efficiency would induce more charge leave on their surfaces. Taken together, the size and Zeta potential measurements have provided useful information on the architecture of the P1, P2, and P3 complexes: (1) P1 and P2 complexes were less dense, although they still appeared to form micelles, (2) a well-defined boundary between PLL/siRNA complexes and PEG segments was not apparent, (3) PLL segments increasingly localized to the PEG corona, and (4) P3 complex is small in size and has a relatively defined layer structure because of the PPG core. It is possible that the small Zeta potential of P3 (~20 mV) may improve its affinity to the cells and internalization by the cells as compared with the other copolymers tested. The possible micelle architecture of complexes of copolymer with siRNA is shown in Figure 6.",

The cells shown were transfected with polyplexes composed of the cationic copolymers P1, P2, and P3 with siRNA at N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. At the lowest N/P ratio of 6, red fluorescent signal was not detected inside the Neuro 2a cells and GFP expression was still very strong, indicating poor uptake of polyplexes. However, when the N/P ratio was increased to 24, labeled siRNA was detected inside the cells and GFP expression decreased. Furthermore, Cy3 signal increased while GFP expression decreased in cells treated with P2 and P3 complexes as compared with cells treated with P1 complex. Thus, at a high N/P ratio of 24, copolymers P2 and P3 demonstrated higher efficiencies for cellular uptake and gene silencing than P1.",

A higher cationic charge in the complexes corresponds to higher transfection efficiency, and is favorable for intracellular release of siRNA. While this higher cationic charge of P2 complex may induce greater gene knockdown, it may also induce greater cytotoxicity. In contrast, for P3-siRNA complex, greater gene knockdown may be attributed to the PPG structure of copolymer P3 and the micelle-complex architecture of their aggregates. In addition, while copolymers P1 and P2 are water soluble block copolymers that can complex with siRNA to form micelle-like aggregates of larger size and lesser density, copolymer P3 has hydrophobic block PPG units.

P3 complexes are more efficient for siRNA delivery and gene silencing than P1. P3-siRNA complexes decreased GFP expression in GFP-expressing Neuro-2a cells to 28%. In addition to the amount of internalized amount of siRNA, the internalization pathway or endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA can also contribute to an effective RNAi effect.
