EBV infection of B lymphocytes is a typical receptor-mediated process and represents a mechanism for the establishment of long-term latency in the host17,18. Such susceptibility is believed to be conferred by an interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp350/22019 and the complement receptor 2 (CR2)/CD21, the primary receptor for EBV on B cells20,21. Receptor-mediated internalization of EBV requires the interaction of another viral envelope glycoprotein gp42 with HLA class II molecules on B cells, which thereafter initiates the fusion process involving the core fusion complex, gH/gL/gp4222,23. This receptor-mediated process is cell type specific, making viral receptors on host cells therapeutic targets24,25,26.",

            "text": "EBV infection of ECs in vivo has been observed for over three decades27,28, with its underlying mechanisms still being actively investigated. In contrast to B cells, ECs express the viral receptor CR2/CD21 at very low levels and do not constitutively express HLA class II molecules29. Therefore, the infection of ECs in vitro by cell-free EBV virions is not as efficient as that of B cells. Nevertheless, ECs can be efficiently infected through co-culturing with Akata cells (an EBV-producing B lymphoblastoid cell line), which is thought to be mediated by a mechanism termed cell-to-cell infection30. This process involves EBV binding to B cells through CR2/CD21, activation of adhesion molecules and the subsequent entry of EBV into ECs31,32. Such an intercellular conjugation requires the interaction between CD11b on EBV-loaded B cells and the heparin moiety of CD44v3 and LEEP-CMA on the basolateral surface of ECs32. Interestingly, cell-to-cell infection rates vary among different types of target cells, ranging from 0% to 25%30,31. More recently, it was reported that cell-to-cell transmission was efficient in mediating EBV infection of raft cultures generated from primary human keratinocytes in vitro, resulting in productive viral replication in organotypic cultures and the release of viral particles to intercellular space33. Of note, cell-to-cell infection is not unique to EBV. It also accounts for the efficient transmission of HIV between susceptible CD4+ T cells34,35, representing a mechanism for resistance to anti-viral therapy and subsequent viral persistence36,37.",

We recently reported the existence of unique cell-in-cell structures in clinical cancer specimens, in which lymphocytes penetrated both malignant and normal ECs38. Cell-in-cell structure was noted over 100 years ago and has recently aroused great interest due to its potential pathophysiological significance39,40. Cell-in-cell structures can occur either homotypically or heterotypically. Heterotypic cell-in-cell structures, formed by the invasion of lymphocytes into tumor cells of epithelial origin, were found to occur more prevalently than homotypic structures both in vitro and in vivo38. The fates of the invading cells and host cells in cell-in-cell structures are diverse41,42,43. Most often the invading lymphocytes die by entosis or emperitosis44. Entosis is a lysosome-dependent cell death and involves the activation of the Rho/Rock signal pathway45. Emperitosis is a caspase 3-dependent apoptotic process40. Only immune cells with cytotoxicity undergo emperitosis. Non-cytotoxic cells, like B cells, undergo entosis. Penetration of lymphocytes into ECs in specimens from patients with NPC46 and in liver sections of mouse hepatitis models38 has been previously reported. However, it is not clear whether the formation of the cell-in-cell structures between ECs and lymphocytes infected by certain viruses such as EBV or HIV plays certain roles in mediating virus transmission to non-susceptible ECs.",

EBV-eGFP Akata cells were derived from EBV\u2212 AK31 cell line that was latently infected with recombinant EBV containing an eGFP gene and a neomycin-resistant gene. eGFP gene was inserted into the viral BXLF1 open reading frame to monitor the activation of EBV and the infection of ECs47. This cell line was referred to as GFP-Akata cells afterward. Consistent with the observations in clinical samples described above, both GFP-Akata cells and parent AK31 cells formed heterotypic cell-in-cell structures with CNE-2 cells after the co-culture in vitro. Remarkably, GFP-Akata cells formed cell-in-cell structures in higher frequency compared with uninfected parent AK31 cells in parallel (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). To determine whether GFP-Akata cells could transfer EBV to CNE-2 cells through the cell-in-cell mechanism, we used time-lapse microscope to track the invading processes of GFP-Akata cells into CNE-2 cells. We observed the gradual increase of green fluorescence in the internalized GFP-Akata cell 6 h after the initiation of co-culture, indicating the activation of EBV. The GFP intensity and the percentage of internalized GFP+ Akata cells continued to increase until 10 h (Figure 2A). However, free GFP-Akata cells maintained the similar GFP positivity during co-culture (data not shown). Internalized GFP-Akata cells appeared intact during the observation period (Figure 2A). We individually tracked 135 cell-in-cell structures with GFP\u2212 GFP-Akata cells at the beginning of the observation for 12 h. Fifteen internalized cells turned green over the interval (Figure 2B). Among them, three went out of host cells intactly (Figure 2B and Supplementary information, Figure S1C). Most internalized GFP-Akata cells displayed characteristics of entotic cell death (lysotracker positive and caspase-3 negative; Supplementary information, Figure S1B). No green fluorescence was observed in CNE-2 cells without cell-in-cell structures.",

To ensure that EBV can be transmitted to CNE-2 cells through cell-in-cell structure formation, GFP-Akata and CNE-2 cells were labeled with CellTracker Green and CellTracker Red dyes, respectively, and co-cultured for 4 h. Double-labeled cells (with the formation of cell-in-cell structures) were sorted by flow cytometry and further selected with G418 for EBV-eGFP-transferred CNE-2 cells with the advantage of neomycin-resistant gene in GFP-Akata cells. Seven days later, 75% of the sorted CNE-2 cells highly expressed GFP compared with the original CNE-2 cells infected with cell-free virus (< 0.1%). We also probed EBV-specfic EBER to localize EBV in the sorted CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures. EBV was located in the nucleus of the CNE-2 cell (Figure 2E). We further examined the expression of key viral genes and proteins, such as EBNA1 (a gene marker for the latency), BALF5 (a gene expressing DNA polymerase, a lytic protein) and viral transcriptional regulatory gene BZLF1 (an indicator for lysis induction) of EBV51, in the sorted CNE-2 cells. As revealed by RT-PCR (Figure 2F) and western blotting assays (Supplementary information, Figure S2B), EBNA1, BALF5 and BZLF1 mRNAs were expressed in the sorted CNE-2 cells with the similar patterns to those of GFP-Akata cells, but not detected in original CNE-2 cells. The accumulation of EBV virions in CNE-2 cells was also detected by TEM (Figure 2G). EBV-like virions were readily observed in the cytoplasm of CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures. The size of the virions was \u223c180 nm. Most virions contained envelopped capsids (Figure 2G, yellow circle).",

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cell-to-cell mechanism also contributes to the transmission of EBV to ECs during co-culture. Therefore, we compared the cell-in-cell-mediated pathway with conventional cell-to-cell-mediated pathway. According to the previously reported cell-to-cell transmission experiments50, GFP-Akata cells were co-cultured with CNE-2 cells at 5:1 ratio for 24 h in the presence or absence of goat anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody. Treatment of anti-IgG induced the entry of the viral lytic cycle in GFP-Akata cells. The non-adherent GFP-Akata cells were removed. Fresh medium was added and cells were cultured for another 24 h. We measured the frequencies of GFP+ CNE-2 cells free in the culture and with cell-in-cell structures, which reprensent the cell-to-cell and cell-in-cell transmission, respectively. The precentage of free GFP+ CNE-2 cells ranged from 0% to 1% with the average of 0.67% in total free CNE-2 cells. Upon the treatment of anti-IgG, the infection rate slightly increased to 0.81%. However, almost 6% of CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures became infected (as evidenced by the appreance of GFP fluorescence) within 48 h regardless of the anti-IgG treatment (Figure 2H). These results suggest that cell-in-cell-mediated EBV transmission to non-susceptible ECs in our experiments occurred independently of cell-to-cell contact.",

After stimulation for 3 days, culture supernatants containing EBV virions were collected. To distinguish EBV virions derived from these two types of cells, A-EBV and C-EBV were named for EBVs from GFP-Akata and iCNE-2 cells, respectively. By using the same amount of virions normalized by quantitative PCR, we first performed the cell-free infection assay in susceptible AK31 and non-susceptible CNE-2 cells to compare the infectivity between A-EBV and C-EBV. A-EBV maintained the capacity to infect AK31 cells at the percentage of \u223c10% but could not infect CNE-2 cells (Figure 3A left and right, blue line for A-EBV infection). Surprisingly, based on the expression of GFP fluorescence, we found that C-EBV from iCNE-2 cells infected both AK31 (Figure 3A, left, red line, 10.1%) and CNE-2 cells (Figure 3A, right, red line, 14.8%). It is well established that deficiency of EBV receptor such as CD21 molecules on ECs is the main obstacle for their susceptibility to cell-free EBV infection19. However, the extra ability of C-EBV to infect CNE-2 cells suggests that CNE-2 cells infected via in-cell infection are able to assemble virions with an extra capacity to infect non-susceptible ECs. This was confirmed when we further compared the capacity of A-EBV and C-EBV to infect other lymphocytes or EC-derived cell lines (Figure 3B). While A-EBV only infected B cell line AK31, C-EBV infected both lymphocytes (AK31) and EC cell lines (i.e., CNE-2, A431, MCF-7, PLC/PRF/5 and an immortalized epithelial cell line NPEC1-Bmi1)53.",

To understand the extended tropism of EBV gained from in-cell infection, we further performed the adsorption experiments to determine the attachment and subsequent infectivity of A-EBV and C-EBV (Supplementary information, Figure S3). A-EBV and C-EBV were incubated with both AK31 and CNE-2 cells for 2 h on ice, the supernatants were collected and fresh media were added to the cells. We calculated the percentages of infected AK31 and CNE-2 cells based on the appearance of GFP. The collected culture supernatants containing free viruses were added to fresh AK31 and CNE-2 cells. The infection rates were compared. As indicated in Figure 3C, A-EBV only infected AK31 cells with the infection rate of 10%-15%, and the unbound A-EBV collected from the AK31 absorption assay showed decreased infection rate for AK31 cells (1%-5%). A-EBV did not infect CNE-2 cells. No GFP+ CNE-2 cells were detected after the incubation with A-EBV. Unbound A-EBV from the CNE-2 cell absorption assay could continue to infect AK31 cells with an infection rate (8%-12%) comparable to that of original A-EBV (10%-15%; Figure 3C). On the other hand, C-EBV retained the ability to infect AK31 cells and gained an extra ability to infect CNE-2 cells (Figure 3D). C-EBV infected AK31 with the infection rate of 12%-15%, which was comparable to that of A-EBV (10%-15%). In addition, C-EBV infected CNE-2 cells with 5%-10% infection rate, much higher than that of A-EBV (< 0.1%). Interestingly, unbound C-EBV collected from the AK31 absorption assay could infect both AK31 and CNE-2 cells with similar infection rates, like the unbound C-EBV from CNE-2 cell supernatants (Figure 3D).",

However, tumor cells are not equivalent to normal ECs. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of in-cell infection in normal ECs by using an immortalized epithelial cell line NEPC1-Bmi153 as the host cell. NEPC1-Bmi1 cells formed heterotypic cell-in-cell structures with GFP-Akata cells in a higher frequency than with AK31 cells, which reached 1% for GFP-Akata cells and 0.66% for Ak31 cells at 24 h (Figure 4A). However, the percentage of NEPC1-Bmi1 cells with cell-in-cell structures was lower than that of CNE-2 cells. GFP+ GFP-Akata cells inside NEPC1-Bmi1 cells were detected 24 h after co-culture (Figure 4B). At 48 h, green fluorescence was observed in NEPC1-Bmi1 cells with cell-in-cell structures (Figure 4C). This indicates that NEPC1-Bmi1 cells can be infected by EBV through cell-in-cell pathway. EBV-derived LMP2A and EBNA1 were co-localized with the GFP protein (Figure 4D), which further verified the successful infection of NEPC1-Bmi1 cells through cell-in-cell pathway. We compared the abilities of C-EBV and A-EBV to infect NEPC1-Bmi1 cells. Similar to CNE-2 cells, C-EBV infected NEPC1-Bmi1 cells at a higher frequency than A-EBV (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate that like tumor-derived ECs, normal ECs can also undergo in-cell infection by EBV-infected B cells.",

B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation triggers the activation of the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn and the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This activates the transcription of BZLF1, which is a switch for EBV activation from latent status. In turn, BZLF1-encoding protein ZEBRA initiates the replication of virus54. We found that EBV in GFP-Akata cells was activated autonomously inside host CNE-2 cells in the absence of extrinsic stimuli. It is evident that the PI3K/AKT pathway is key to EBV activation in both cell-free and cell-to-cell contact infections50,55. We then asked whether the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was turned on during the autonomous EBV activation after cell-in-cell structure formation. We detected the phosphorylation of AKTSer473 in GFP-Akata cells with cell-in-cell structures. By 12 h, the GFP fluorescence was co-localized with phosphorylated AKTSer473 in GFP-Akata cells, but was not detected in CNE-2 cells (Figure 5A). Similarly, no phosphorylation of AKT was observed in AK31 cells when they entered CNE-2 cells during the same observation time (Supplementary information, Figure S4). Our results were in accordance with the report55 that EBV immediate-early protein BRLF1 could induce the activation of PI3K/AKT and the subsequent viral activation. This suggests the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling in EBV activation within GFP-Akata cells during in-cell infection. When the co-culture continued, the level of phosphorylated AKT increased in GFP+ GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells (Figure 5B). To further demonstrate the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling in EBV activation, the broad-spectrum PI3K signaling inhibitor, Wortmannin, was added after GFP-Akata cells were co-cultured with CNE-2 cells for 2 or 4 h. After another 24 h co-culture, GFP signal and AKT phosphorylation were measured in cell-in-cell structures. As shown in Figure 5C, Wortmannin dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT inside GFP-Akata cells (Figure 5C, left). In parallel, GFP expression in GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells also decreased dramatically (Figure 5C, right). We obtained the similar results when we used another PI3K inhibitor LY296002 (data not shown). These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling is involved in EBV activation within B cells after cell-in-cell structure formation.",

However, certain alternative infection mechanisms have been reported30. During EBV infection, it is well accepted that due to the lack of EBV receptors on ECs, cell-to-cell infection is the main pathway for EBV infection rather than receptor-mediated cell-free infection31,32. During cell-to-cell infection, the transmission of EBV from B cells to ECs relies on the conjugate formation between B cells and ECs, which facilitates the entry of viruses into ECs through either membrane fusion or endocytosis32. Compared with cell-to-cell infection, in-cell infection undergoes an alternative infection pathway in which its tropism rarely relies on the interaction between host cells and virus and the transmission occurs more rapidly and efficiently. It has been reported that successful cell-to-cell infection of EBV happened after 24 h50. However, in-cell infection initiated within 4 h with the rapid formation of cell-in-cell structures. EBV was subsequently activated by 6 h (Figure 2B and Supplementary information, Figure S1C) and the activation was sustained. With the occurrence of lysosome-dependent cell-in-cell death (entosis) of the internalized EBV-infected GFP-Akata B cells (Supplementary information, Figure S1B), EBV was released into host ECs to accomplish the transmission of viruses. This is in accordance with the observation that the expression of GFP, phosphorylation of AKTSer473 and entosis of GFP-Akata cells occurred in parallel. Unlike the cell-to-cell spread of EBV to polarized oral ECs, which requires the conjugation between CD11b on B cells and heparan sulphate moieties of CD44v3 and LEEP-CAM on ECs32, the successful in-cell infection is expected to depend on molecules involved in cell-in-cell structure formation such as ezrin or ICAM-141,45. The exact molecules participating in initiating in-cell infection need to be experimentally verified.",

It is widely accepted that EBV activation is the prerequisite for the viral infection of ECs either by cell-free virions or through cell-to-cell contact30,50. The molecular mechanism of EBV activation in infected B cells upon anti-IgG treatment has been well illustrated49. BCR ligation triggers the activation of the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn and the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes the transcription of BZLF1 and BRLF1 and subsequently initiates the replication of virus54,55. The PI3K/AKT pathway has been reported to play crucial roles in cell-to-cell EBV transfer as well50. We have also demonstrated the phosphorylation of AKT at the early stage after cell-in-cell structure formation with the appearance of GFP signals. This suggests the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the activation of EBV in GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells. We thus propose that when internalized EBV-infected B cells are wrapped in the vacuole of host cells, certain factors inside the specific microenvironment of the vacuole might dedicate to the activation of EBV. We also found that the activation of AKT occurred simultaneously with the initiation of cell-in-cell entotic death (data not shown). The activation of EBV and the occurrence of entotic death of B cells inside CNE-2 cells thus constitute two prerequisites for the efficient transmission of EBV from internalized GFP-Akata cells to CNE-2 cells. The significance of ligation-independent EBV activation is that the latency of EBV can be rapidly interrupted when EBV-burdened B cells are internalized into ECs. This process might be related to the intrinsic maintenance of long-term persistent infection.",

EBV generated from in-cell infected CNE-2 cells exhibited high potency to infect both B cells and ECs in cell-free conditions. It is reported that EBV infection of ECs is supposed to allow the virus to gain optimal tropism56 and the rapid expansion of infection33. During in-cell infection, EBV is activated in tropic B cells and released to ECs after entotic death of B cells inside ECs (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). With the entotic death of B cells, in-cell infected ECs thus possess the cellular components of both B cells and ECs. The cells might assemble EBV virion particles in alternative manners with extended viral tropism and higher efficacy. Another possibility lies in the genetic and epigenetic alterations of EBV after in-cell infection. This is consistent with the \u201ccell-in-cell selection\u201d model that we suggested before39, in which the internalized cells adapt to the internal microenvironment to package EBV in a separate process. The exact molecular mechanisms are under investigation.",

            "text": "With the prevalence of heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation between virus-loaded immune cells and tissue cells during chronic infection38, in-cell infection of non-susceptible ECs with broader potency and higher efficiency might be more inclined to form the viral latency. The cell-in-cell pathway not only mediates the infection of ECs but also provides virus-bearing tropic cells inside ECs with a shelter to escape from immune attack. A few reports have described the presence of virions in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal epithelium16,57 and the phenomena of latent or replicating EBV in intro-epithelial B cells46. However, the exact mechanisms are unclear. According to our study, heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation in vitro between EBV-infected B cells and ECs to some extent recapitulates the interaction between infiltrating lymphocytes and tissue cells during persistent infection. Our findings thus favor the view that ECs undergoing EBV in-cell infection might be a more stable virus pool in\nvivo to maintain the latency of EBV owing to the high incidence of heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation in local inflammatory region. In addition, heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation between B cells and ECs might also induce the chromosome instability and formation of aneuploidy, which has been reported during the formation of homotypic cell-in-cell structures58. To our opinion, in-cell infection-mediated EBV persistency and heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation-mediated aneuploidy perform the \u201cdouble shocks\u201d, which may accelerate the transformation of normal ECs and the subsequent nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis.",

More recently, the cell-in-cell structure formation is demonstrated to be able to promote clonal selection and human tumor evolution mediated by cell competition, a mechanism evolved to eliminate less fit cells from a heterogeneous cell population65,66. In this study, we have demonstrated its involvement in EBV viral infection of non-susceptible ECs through the invasion of B cells into ECs. This will be helpful to explain the observation of the presence of HIV in intestinal and genital ECs in AIDS patients, which has been extensively debated. Considering the diversity of virus-infected cells such as B or T cells and their engagement in cell-in-cell structures during chronic infection, in-cell infection might represent a general receptor-independent mechanism of viral infections of non-susceptible tissue cells. The cell-in-cell structure formation might thus participate in the pathogenesis of viral infection through its unique biological behavior. Further investigations on its molecular mechanisms will undoubtedly provide new clues and targets for the prevention and treatment of viral infections in clinic.",
