Nevertheless, in some occasions viruses can evade the immune reaction of the airways, leading to austere respiratory diseases.1 Potent mechanical and immunosuppressive methods protect the lungs against external infections, but a solitary respiratory tract infection can change immunity and pathology.2 Secondary serious bacterial infection (SBI) in children with acute bronchiolitis has been an apprehension expressed by health care providers.3 Several published studies have shown an association between acute bronchiolitis and secondary bacterial infection, including urinary tract infections (UTI).4\u201313 However, the proposed mechanism by which a virus can induce UTIs is not yet known.",

The review included 11 studies.4\u20137,9\u201313,15,16 The rate of urinary tract infections in the 11 studies analyzed was 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.9\u20135.7%). The authors concluded the rate of urine cultures positive for bacteria was noteworthy, though asymptomatic bacteriuria may have muddled the results. Recently, McDaniel et al17 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the prevalence of UTI in infants and young children with bronchiolitis when positive urinalysis (UA) results being incorporated into the UTI definition. The investigators included 18 studies,4\u20137,9,11\u201313,15,16,18\u201325 seven of which had UA information.4,11,16,18,20\u201322 The definition of positive UA varied among the studies. Some considered positive UA as having more than 5 white blood cells per high-powered field, while others considered the UA positive by having bacteriuria, positive leukocyte esterase, or positive nitrite. The prevalence of UTI in bronchiolitis in the 18 studies was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.8\u20134.6%). The authors further analyzed the data of the 7 studies where the presence of pyuria or nitrites was a diagnostic criterion to define UTI and the prevalence of UTI was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3\u20131.4%).",

Hendaus et al8 studied the prevalence of urinary tract infection in infants and children with bronchiolitis. The study included 835 pediatric patients with acute bronchiolitis. The mean (\u00b1SD) age at diagnosis was 3.47\u00b12.99 months. There were 325 (39%) girls and 510 (61%) boys. Participants were divided into three groups: group 1 comprised of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and a positive diagnosis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis; group 2 comprised of children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis with no virus detected; and group 3 comprised of children hospitalized with clinical with bronchiolitis and a positive diagnosis respiratory virus other than RSV. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, RSV was notorious in 352 (45.7%) patients; respiratory viruses other than RSV were identified in 275 (35.7%) patients and 142 (18.4%) were studied but had no viruses detected. Non-RSV viruses comprised of rhinovirus (n=85 [31%]), parainfluenza virus type 4 (n=40 [14%]), adenovirus (n=40 [14%]), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (n=27 [10%]), bocavirus (n=27 [10%]), coronavirus (n=20 [7%]), parainfluenza virus (hPIV) type 1 (n=9 [3.4%]), hPIV type 2 (n=9 [3.4%]), hPIV type 3 (n=9 [3.4%]), and H1N1pdm09 (n=9 [3.4%]). The definition of UTI was adopted from the American Academy of Pediatrics as\nclinicians should require both urinalysis results that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of \u226550,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of a uropathogen cultured from a urine specimen obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspirate.26",
