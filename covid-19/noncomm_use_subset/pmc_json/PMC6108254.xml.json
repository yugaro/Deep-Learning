Its prevalence after heart surgeries has been reported Up to 78% of pulmonary complications (6). The incidence of atelectasis after heart surgery has been reported 75% in an Iranian study (7). Atelectasis is characterized by the collapse of the alveoli, lobules or larger unit respiratory systems that occurs after thoracic surgeries due to reasons such as uneven distribution of ventilation and perfusion due to factors such as anesthesia (8, 9), extracorporeal circulation, sternotomy, analgesics (8, 10), respiratory muscle dysfunction (9), post-operative pain, drainage (11), decreased phrenic nerve activity and diaphragmatic dysfunction (4, 12), which lung volumes are reduced, and atelectasis happens then. The importance of postoperative atelectasis is due to the absence of obvious clinical symptoms, and therefore it does not attract the attention of medical personnel and healthcare staff. In addition, it is progressive and can lead to other pulmonary complications such as nosocomial pneumonia and subsequent increase in the length of hospital stay as well as rising costs for healthcare systems (3, 13).\n",

Given the simultaneous use of all active respiratory physiotherapy procedures, the high incidence rate of atelectasis after heart surgery is still reported in patients (7, 15). One of these methods that are utilized less as a preventive operation is the use of PEEP in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit or during recovery. PEEP is applied along with an increase in respiratory factors, lung volumes and improved gas and alveolar exchanges (16, 17), and is recommended for the main treatment of collapse created in patients under anesthesia with healthy lungs (18, 19), atelectasis treatment and improved arterial oxygenation (20, 21). Some studies on the benefits of PEEP different levels reported that elevated values could lead to a reduction in ventilator duration and increased survival odds ratio (22). A study on the adverse effects of high levels (PEEP>10 cm of water) reported an increase in ventilation duration, prolonged intubation (23) and increased length of hospitalization (24). This complication in above studies resulting from the use of PEEP was equal to 30 cm of water\u200f. Some of the articles pointed out the lack of difference among different levels (25-27). Meanwhile, most of the studies examined patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and no studies have been done on other cardiac surgical patients. Moreover, the application of PEEP is raised as an effective therapeutic method and is used less as a preventive method for all patients.\n",

However, 8 cm H2O PEEP and 5 cm H2O PEEP had no significant effect in reducing the incidence rate of atelectasis. In a similar study on the effect of 5 cm H2O PEEP and 10 cm H2O PEEP after coronary artery bypass surgery, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of atelectasis incidence. Thus, some degree of atelectasis was found among the intervention (26.7%) and the control (56.7%) groups that the level of 10 cm H2O PEEP reduced the incidence rate of atelectasis, which is in line with the present study. Compared with our study, in the mentioned study the patients in the intervention group did not receive constant PEEP, but the rate varied between 5 to 10 cm of water until tracheal extubation depending on the patient's condition. In addition, the patients in the control group received PEEP less than 5 cm of water. However, in our study, all patients in the control group received at least 5 cm H2O PEEP ; this could be the reasons for the high percentages in both intervention and control groups in the above study compared with the present study (28).\n",

This result is consistent with the present study and the duration was reduced only in the 10 cm H2O PEEP group. Another study on PEEP following coronary artery bypass grafting reported that levels over 10 cm H2O PEEP increased ventilation duration (23), contrary to our results. This difference seems to be due to the fact that the average age is an important factor in the delayed extubation and in an increase of connectivity to ventilator after heart surgery (36). In the mentioned study, the average age in the group with high levels of PEEP was equal to 65\u00b18 years; but in the present study, age over 65 years was one of the exclusion criteria.\n",

Considering the history of cardiac surgery and the advent of subsequent novel care methods, we can also see the incidence of atelectasis as common pulmonary complications. Although numerous research have been done on the effect of PEEP in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, its effects on respiratory function in patients after heart surgery has been less published. Researchers still have not reached a clear consensus on the effective level and duration of its use after heart surgery as a preventive action.\n",
