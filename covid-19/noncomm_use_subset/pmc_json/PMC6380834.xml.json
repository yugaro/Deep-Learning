There are qualitative fit tests (QLFTs) and quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) that are approved and recommended by OSHA.[18] The QLFT is based on the wearer's senses of taste and smell using isoamyl acetate, saccharin, Bitrex (denatonium benzoate), or irritant smoke. The QNFT measures the fit factor by numerical value using the fit test equipment and eight movements performed for 1 minute each: normal breathing, deep breathing, moving head side to side, moving head up and down, bending over, talking, and normal breathing again.[19]",

The mean and standard deviation of fit factor before training were 43.1 and 73.3, and the mean and standard deviation of fit factor after training were 86.5 and 75.4. Using G-power 3.1.9.2 (Heine Heinrich University, Dusseldorf, Germany), the calculated effect size was 0.58, the alpha error was 0.05, and the power was 0.8.

We showed them how to wear respirators in a multistep process: (1) donning it correctly, (2) making adjustments for a secure facial seal, (3) confirming the fit, and (4) properly removing it.[27] The participants followed each step and received feedback immediately. The fit check (also known as seal check) is a procedure advocated by CDC, a self-check the wearer performs to detect air leakage of the respirator. The fit check includes both positive and negative pressure checks. To perform the positive pressure check, the wearer places both hands over the front of the respirator and exhales gently into the respirator. The face fit is considered acceptable if a slight positive pressure can be made inside the respirator without outward leakage of air at the seal. To perform the negative pressure check, the wearer covers the respirator with the palm of the hands and inhales gently so that the respirator collapses slightly and holds the breath for ten seconds. If the respirator collapses slightly but remains in shape and no inward leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered acceptable.[28] All processes were conducted by the faculty of the Infection Control Department at Hanyang University Medical Centre.",

In this simulation study, educators took note of the above procedures and provided detailed and practical training to each participant on each procedure and gave feedback.

The clinical experience of all participants in this study was more than three years, and they had been trained to wear respirators and had experience wearing respirators. Nevertheless, proper protection performance of the respirator could not be expected before training and was improved after training. As seen in Table 4, particularly adequate protection showed 100% of normal breathing after training regardless of respirator type. The training on respirators for healthcare providers in the EMC helped to improve protection performance. Considering that the training time was less than 30 min and that the training consists of feedback by the educator and a fit check by the participants, the improvement effect of training on the protection performance of the respirator can be judged to be large without other equipment and long training times. The protection performance of respirators was improved after training, but it is also important to choose the right respirator because the respirator with the highest protective performance was still the highest after training. Therefore, the choice of a proper respirator is important.[8]",

In one study, wearing a respirator for a long time did not create clinical physiological burdens. However, wearers showed subjective discomfort and symptoms.[32] If the respirator causes discomfort, compliance with wearing respirators could be reduced. Therefore, wearing comfortable and preferred respirators is important.[33,34] The better the adhesion of the respirator, the more the pressure on the face and the discomfort increases. Decreased pressure between the respirator and face can be comfortable but leaky.[30,32] A fold-type respirator can be preferred to cup-type when it is necessary to wear the respirator for a long time, since a cup-type respirator creates increased pressure at the same fit factor compared with a fold-type respirator.[30]",

The researchers used three types of filter respirators that were routinely used in Korea during the outbreak of MERS. The cup-type (3M 1860) and fold-type (3M 1870) respirators are NIOSH certified N95 filter respirators, while the valve-type (3M 9332) respirators are FFP3 filter respirators certified in the European standard EN 149. Second, there are hundreds of filter respirators, but only three types of filter respirators were used in this study. Third, participants in this study worked in only one EMC, and only two nurses participated. Because healthcare providers have different training and clinical experience depending on the institute and occupation, conducting simulations including more occupations and institutions is necessary. Fourth, only one method of training was selected. Fifth, this study did not investigate the sustained effect of training. OSHA requires respirator users to be trained and pass the fit test annually.[19]",
