In general, IL-18 induction of IFN-\u03b3 is similar to that of IL-12, when it is a sole cytokine. Interleukin-18 induces low levels of IFN-\u03b3, but in the presence of costimulants, IFN-\u03b3 production is greatly enhanced [6]. However, because antibodies to IL-18 also reduced the hepatotoxicity of endotoxaemia, IL-18 was considered to possess other biological properties beyond that of inducing IFN-\u03b3 [7]. Interleukin-18 activates T cells to synthesize IL-2, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1. There are also reports that IL-18 suppresses the production of IL-10 and does not induce the production of IL-1Ra. In general, the ability of IL-18 to induce different cytokines depends on the cellular targets [8]. Flisiak et al. confirmed an association between plasma IL-18 concentration and psoriasis severity. Moreover, it was shown that combined measurement of IL-18 and TGF-\u03b21 in plasma can be considered as a possible biomarker of psoriasis activity [9]. Kato et al. indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the IL-18 gene is associated with the presence of psoriasis, but not atopic dermatitis. This suggests that the SNP is associated with susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris, presumably by affecting the production of IL-18 [10].",

Krueger [18] reported, in his study on a large series of skin biopsies, increased protein expression in lesional as opposed to non-lesional skin samples. Other investigators stated that lesional skin might be the source of the elevated plasma levels of IL-18 [19]. In the present work quantitative PCR using mRNA taken from uninvolved skin revealed low but detectable levels of IL-18 mRNA expression. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that human keratinocytes are capable of synthesizing low levels of IL-18 mRNA even under non-stimulated conditions [20]. Chang et al. [21] found that genes specifically modulated in uninvolved skin play a major role in triggering disease progression, and in being the first candidate for early disease diagnosis or development of new therapies.

            "text": "In the present study the IL-18 expression in patients receiving topical steroids was significantly lower in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before and after treatment. After 2 months of treatment, IL-18 expression levels returned back to low values but not significantly lower than the lesional skin levels of expression before treatment. In patients receiving methotrexate non-lesional skin expression was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment. Also the expression levels decreased after treatment but still not statistically significantly when compared to lesional skin before treatment. Otkjaer et al. [22] determined IL-19 and IL-20 in non-lesional and lesional psoriatic skin after 28 days of treatment using topical calcipotriol ointment for mild cases and oral cyclosporine for moderate and severe cases. They found that in patients treated with calcipotriol, IL-19 and IL-20 mRNA expression levels in lesional psoriatic skin were reduced after 14 days, but the reduction became statistically significant only after 28 days. So the timing for mRNA expression analysis could affect the degree of significance. This is further supported by studies demonstrating a decrease of IL-18 levels after narrowband UVB therapy together with other parameters characteristic of the T helper 1 (Th1) response [23]. Apart from stimulating the Th1 response, IL-18 can regulate the Th2 response depending on the local cytokine network. Interleukin-12 enhances IFN-\u03b3 production induced by IL-18, whereas IL-18 alone induces IL- 4 and IL-13 production [24].",

This could be supported by its correlation with clinical severity, disease duration and its expression reduction after treatment. The decreased expression after treatment was not to an extent indicating that the skin had returned to normal. The small size of the study population and the heterogeneous group of patients participating in the study preclude the drawing of firm conclusions. Future studies on genes involved and array based technologies should allow confirmation of the results. Also further studies are recommended to try other lines of treatment for psoriasis. One of these lines of therapy is to try r-h IL-18 BP to neutralize IL-18 activity on a wide scale that may ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.",
