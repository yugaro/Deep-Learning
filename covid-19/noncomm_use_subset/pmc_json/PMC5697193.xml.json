The number of diarrheic calves enrolled from each farm (approximately 5% of the total number of calves raised at each farm per year), the year and season in which the samples were collected, the management practices as well as the total duration the farm was enrolled in the study are presented in Table 1. Cases (diarrheic) and control (healthy) calves were farm\u2010, season\u2010, year\u2010, and age\u2010matched. Cases and controls were defined on the basis of the physical examination and fecal consistency (liquid, semiliquid, pasty, or firm). Calves that had liquid or semiliquid feces, fever (temperature >39.5\u00b0C) and decreased appetite were considered as diarrheic (i.e., cases), and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. Once a diarrheic calf was identified an age\u2010matched (\u00b12 days), control calf was enrolled on each farm. Calves were not included in the study if they had a previous incident of diarrhea since birth (only the first case of diarrhea was included in the study).

At the time of the outbreak, approximately 200 preweaned calves were maintained in the calf barn. The calculated incidence of diarrhea increased from (calculated from the month before the outbreak) 36% to 57% (54/94) during the outbreak period in calves <30 days. The case fatality increased from 5% to 17% (9/54). Eight severely affected diarrheic calves were referred to the Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Centre (OVC\u2010HSC) for diagnosis and treatment of diarrhea. Rectal swabs or fecal samples and nasal swabs were collected at admission. Fecal samples were tested by culture for Salmonella spp using Rappaport\u2010Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths and inoculation onto brilliant green sulpha and Hektoen agars. Escherichia coli was isolated on blood and MacConkey's agars, and isolates were serotyped using antiserum against F4 (K88) and F5 (K99) fimbriae for detection of ETEC. Sucrose wet mount assay was used for detection of Cryptosporidium spp and Giardia Spp, and real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect ruminant rotavirus A and B. PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR and BCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR assays were used to screen fecal samples and nasal swabs for the presence of BCoV. Additionally, a farm visit took place 3 days after presentation of the eight affected calves.

The matching variables were as follows: age, farm, and time of diarrhea cases. We, therefore, summarized primary exposure in case and control animals by simple cross\u2010tabulations, and additionally examined frequency of primary exposure in case and control animals across variables representing the matched variables including age, farm, calendar year, and season. Statistical analysis was conducted by two approaches: conditional exact logistic regression accounting for the matched pair as strata and by random intercept logistic regression where the matched pair designation represented a random effect on the intercept. After the univariable analysis, difference in the effect of the BCoV across each of the matched factors was evaluated by evaluating statistical significance of interaction between BCoV with each of the matching variables. The final models (Exact logistic regression and Random effect logistic regression) considered inclusion of all variables that were statistically significant at liberal P\u2010value of <0.20.

None of the healthy calves developed diarrhea within one week after sampling. Cases were distributed across six herds (Fig 1), all four seasons (Fig 2), and over a period of 3 years (Fig 3). BCoV was detected in 157/286 (55%) of calves; 46% (66/143) of healthy calves, and 64% (91/143) of diarrheic calves (Table 2). Overall, diarrhea cases had higher odds of BCoV presence than the age\u2010matched control animals, although the numerical estimates varied slightly between the estimates based on exact logistic regression and random intercept logistic regression (Table 3). Sex was also associated with the presence of BCoV, with male calves at increased risk (Table 3). Based on the nonsignificant interaction between BCoV and matching factors (age, farm, season, and year), the association of BCoV with diarrhea did not appear to vary according to age of the animals, season, and farm (Tables 3 and 5, Figs 2 and 3). In exact logistic regression, interaction of exposure with year of sampling was close to statistical significance and indicated that in year 2015, the effect of BCoV could have been different than in the other 2 years (Table 3). The effect of year in 2015 could not be identified as statistically significant in the random effect model for the year of 2015 (Fig 3). The final model (exact logistic regression and random effect logistic regression) contained covariates for BCoV and sex. Their interaction was not statistically significant, and the coefficients for both BCoV and sex changed by very small quantity once both variables were in the model. This suggests that sex failed to act as confounder for the association between BCoV and diarrhea in this dataset (Table 3).",

The prevalence of infectious agents causing diarrhea in calves was previously investigated in dairy farms from Ontario at three different periods by ELISA assays, 1982,26 1990\u20131991,27 and 1995\u20131997.10 The overall prevalence of BCoV in the 1982's study was 5% (3/56), but this study did not discriminate the prevalence of healthy and diarrheic calves.26 In the 1992 study, the prevalence of BCoV in diarrheic calves was 17% (54/312), whereas in 1998, the overall prevalence was 10% (16/161), and BCoV was detected in 13% (15/118) and 2.3% (1/43) of diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively. The reasons for these differences in the detection rates of BCoV in calves (healthy and diarrheic) between this study and previous investigations in the same geographic area (Ontario) are unclear. In fact, it is difficult to discern whether the increasing detection of BCoV reflects a true rise in prevalence in the course of time or whether it is due to simply to the better detection rate.28 The differences between studies could be explained, at least in part, by changes in farm management practices overtime (e.g., calf population density, antimicrobial drug use, and management/agricultural practices), differences in the type of assay used for detection of BCoV, and the emergence or re\u2010emergence of BCoV strains over the years.",

Similar to other RNA viruses, CoVs are believed to mutate frequently that could result in altered antigenicity and pathogenicity of new strains.33, 34 During the past decades, several CoVs have caused serious problems in humans and animals (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS\u2010CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS\u2010CoV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV).35 Emerging outbreaks associated with CoV also have been documented in horses worldwide,36 and emerging canine CoV variants have been associated with systemic infections in the European Union.37 In an Oklahoma study, a new CoV belonging to a BCoV clade 2 was isolated from nasal secretion and lung fluids of postweaned healthy beef calves and calves with respiratory disease.38 This new field isolate was antigenically and genetically different to previously isolated BCoV strains including those from neonatal diarrhea, reference strains, and the strain in the current modified live vaccine BCoV licence in United States that belong to CoV clade 1.38 Similar results have been reported in Europe4 and Asia.39 In 2012, the BCoV clade 2 strain was recovered from postweaned calves (6\u20137 months) suffering of severe enteritis with bloody diarrhea; the authors of that study suggested that this clinical syndrome caused by BCoV clade 2 should be added to the already known syndromes caused by BCoV.40 The results of these studies suggest that current BCoV strains circulating in worldwide are diverging from the prototype BCoV isolated in earlier studies and used in vaccines.38 This can result in the emergency of new clinical syndromes,40 outbreaks of enteric diseases with higher morbidity and case fatality (similar to the one described in this study), increased detection rates of BCoV in nasal and fecal samples of healthy and ill calves,4, 18, 41 and the lack of efficacy vaccination protocols.42 Future studies should focus on investigating the biological, antigenical, and genomical characteristic of BCoV circulating in Canada. It is important to highlight that in this study no other virus, parasites, and bacterial agents were investigated, and the role of BCoV in association with multiple pathogens was not determined which prevent us to clearly identify the role of BCoV as a primary cause of disease or as a agent associated with coinfection.",

Currently, viral culture is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of viral gastrointestinal disorders; however, detection of coronavirus by culture isolation or serological methods can be difficult.23 To overcome this issue and obtain rapid diagnostic results, several sensitive molecular assays for detection of CoV have been developed, including RT\u2010PCR, nested RT\u2010PCR, and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Recently, a novel PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR assay was designed to allow detection of all known CoV based on an alignment of conserved genome regions of several coronavirus.43 These results showed a good level of agreement between BCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR and the novel PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR assays indicating that PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR can be a rapid tool to detect BCoV in samples from cattle. Future studies with a larger sample size are required to corroborate these findings.",

A new PanCoV\u2010RT\u2010PCR was useful in identifying the presence of CoV in nasal and fecal samples from diarrheic calves during an outbreak of diarrhea.",
