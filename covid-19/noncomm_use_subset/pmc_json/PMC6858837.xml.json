Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can utilize less invasive samples such as feather follicles, feces/urine, and cloacal swabs,5,7,9\u201313 however sensitivity will vary due to intermittent viral shedding.13\u201315",

            "text": "Immunologic testing comparing ABV specific antigens found that the viral nucleoprotein is immunodominant and hence the best antigen to use in a microtiter plate ELISA and in fluorescent antibody assays.9,16 A mixed anti-avian species IgY secondary antibody is often used in ABV serologic tests.8,9,17\u201320 The anti-bird secondary antibody, produced in goats using immunoglobulins from the White-crowned sparrow, Ringed turtle dove, domestic chicken, and Muscovy duck,a has been used in other ELISAs for the detection of arboviruses, flaviviruses, alpha-viruses, and poxviruses.21\u201324 The advantage of an anti-bird secondary antibody is the range of species that can be tested. This anti-bird secondary antibody has been used in serologic tests for the detection of antibodies in psittacine birds, even though the immunogen used to stimulate this secondary antibody did not contain antibodies from psittaciformes. Anti-passerine IgY secondary antibody produces better results than the anti-bird IgY secondary antibody or the anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody for serologic assays on passerine birds.25 This suggests that species-specific secondary antibodies may provide more sensitive results in immunologic assays than commercially available mixed species anti-bird secondary antibody. In assays that employ short antigen-antibody incubation times, such as dot-blot or lateral flow ELISAs, a species-specific secondary antibody may be more useful when testing psittacine birds. Additionally due to the large variety of avian species susceptible to ABV infection, a low affinity of the secondary antibody could result in erroneous test results. The goal of this study was to evaluate the specificity of different avian secondary antibodies used in Western blot and dot-blot ELISA to detect ABV antibodies in the plasma of Blue and gold macaw (Ara ararauna), Cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), Monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), and Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).",

            "text": "Recombinant nucleoprotein (N-protein), purified from E. coli, was produced following the method of Hameed et al (2018).26 Briefly, the procedure was as follows. Total RNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue of a Yellow-collared macaw (Primolius auricollis) infected with PaBV-4 using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was used to generate cDNA using reverse transcription kits (High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and random hexamers. Subsequent PCR was performed to amplify the N-protein gene with primers Forward 5\u02b9-CATG CAT ATG CCA CCC AAG AGA CAA AGA AGC-3\u02b9 and Reverse 5\u02b9-GTAC CTC GAG GTT TGC GAA TCC GGT TAC ACC-3\u02b9. The resulting PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and inserted into pET21a vector to generate a His-tagged fusion protein for expression in Escherichia coli (Rosetta, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant E. coli was incubated for 12 hrs in Luria broth fortified with ampicillin; the culture was continuously mixed at 150 rpm at room temperature. Recombinant E. coli was transferred to fresh media of Luria broth, ampicillin, and Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to induce protein expression and incubated for 6 hrs, while being continuously stirred at 200 rpm at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged at 3500 x g for 30 mins and the supernatant was removed. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 40 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated for 3 sets of 8 mins to lyse the bacteria. The sonicated solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 mins at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded on a Qiagen Ni-NTA Agarose column, which had been pre-conditioned with 10 mL of binding buffer (20mM sodium phosphate, 300mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 10mM imidazole); the Qiagen Ni-NTA Agarose column has a high affinity for His-tagged proteins. Ten mL of wash buffer (20mM sodium phosphate, 300mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 20mM imidazole) was loaded on the column and allowed gravity flow. The column was then eluted by gravity flow with 10 mL of elution buffer (20mM sodium phosphate, 300mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM imidazole) and the elutant was collected in 1mL fractions. The purity of each protein fraction was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis. Fractions containing the N-protein were combined and an Amico Ultra 15 mL centrifugal filter was used to concentrate the N-protein in 1 mL PBS. Finally, the protein concentration was measured using BCA\u2122 Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific\u2122 PIERCE\u2122, Waltham, MA. USA).",

Image brightness and contrast was adjusted by selecting Image, Adjust, Brightness/Contrast, Auto, Apply. An area of interest was delineated over individual signal dots using the rectangular selection tool, then selecting Analyse, Gel, Select First Lane. This delineated rectangular area was dragged to each of the other signal dots and then selecting Analysis, Gel, Select Next Lane. Use of a consistent delineated area provided equally sized areas of interest for analysis. A graphical depiction of dot signal intensity for each dot selected was acquired by selecting Analysis, Gel, Plot Lanes. The area representing the dot signal intensity was delineated using the straight line tool from the bar menu. After all dot areas were delineated, the wand tool from the bar menu was used to highlight these areas, which generated a signal intensity value. For each dot, three dot signal intensity values were independently generated with Image J and a mean dot signal intensity value was reported.",

In this study, the use of anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody in the dot-blot ELISA for testing antibody-positive Blue and gold macaw plasma generated appreciably better visible signals with consistently higher signal intensity than the use of anti-bird, anti-duck, or anti-chicken IgY secondary antibodies (Figure 2; Table 1).

The polyclonal nature of the anti-bird IgY antibodies make it an ideal secondary antibody for immunodiagnostic assays due to its ability to recognize multiple epitopes on the target antiglobulin and on the different species antiglobulins. However, the varying affinities of the polyclonal IgY antibodies can cause differences in the signal strength obtained from assays with long or short incubation times, such as seen between the Western blot and dot-blot ELISA, respectively, in our study. In the dot-blot ELISA, mainly high affinity secondary antibodies, which bind quickly and with a greater stability than lower affinity secondary antibodies, produce the signal. Additionally, the polyclonal nature of the anti-bird IgY secondary antibody produced a higher avidity in the dot-blot ELISAs for Monk parakeet and Mallard antiglobulins, as observed by the stronger dot visibility and signal intensity, than the avidity for Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel antiglobulins (Figure 2). Exactly what factors were involved and how they differed was beyond the scope of this project, but the issue of reaction incubation time and its effect on avidity should be explored further if a dot-blot ELISA is to be optimized as a rapid, patient-side diagnostic assay.",

            "text": "Background noise in all tests must also be considered. In this study, a faint signal was observed in the negative samples of Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel samples when the anti-duck and anti-chicken IgY secondary antibodies were used in the Western blot and dot-blot ELISAs; the signals of the corresponding negative samples were visibly similar to those of the positive samples (Figures 1 and 2). However, when analyzing the signal intensities of the dot-blot ELISA, there was no significant difference between the signal intensity of the negative and positive Blue and gold macaw or Cockatiel samples when anti-duck or anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody was used (Table 1). This background signal may have been due to cross-reactions with antibodies to E. coli antigens in the samples. Antibodies against E. coli are found in human serum and can cause background noise in serologic assays that use recombinant proteins.31,32 Similar studies in birds show non-specific signals due to E. coli antibodies in plasma samples and to recombinant E. coli antigens in serologic tests.33,34 Affinity purification of the His-tagged recombinant N-protein with the Ni-NTA Agarose column may not have removed all E. coli antigens from the recombinant E. coli/N-protein solution. E.coli proteins can have some histidine conformation or during the generation of the recombinant N-protein,some His-tagged E.coli proteins may have been generated with the insertion of the pET21a vector into the E. coli. Thus, some E. coli antigens may have been present in the PVDF membranes and the NC membrane strips of the Western blot and dot-blot ELISAs, respectively, and able to react with antibodies in the sample. To reduce non-specific signals and background noise in the assays, procedures that will absorb or neutralize E. coli antibodies in plasma samples or that will increase the purity of the recombinant N-protein antigen need to be investigated. However even without these additional procedures, the dot-blot ELISA readily discriminated between ABV antibody positive and negative samples (Figure 2), especially in species most prone to natural infection. This suggests the possibility of developing a rapid, patient-side assay that will detect ABV antibodies in psittacine birds.",
