In this coevolution process, HCV exhibits multifaceted interactions with the host cells, and these cellular stress responses subsequently affect virus replication.

First, we briefly discuss the signaling triggered by the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptor (RLR) and the Toll-like receptor (TLR), which leads to type I IFN synthesis and IFN-mediated signaling pathway activation, resulting in the expression of a variety of effector ISGs. We also summarize the strategies that HCV uses to escape IFN antiviral surveillance. Additionally, we highlight what is currently known regarding the pivotal ISGs in viral infections, with an emphasis on their anti-HCV activities, and the emerging ISGs identified from recent genome-wide siRNA screens in relation to anti-HCV activities. Finally, we discuss the potential functions of several critical cellular factors, such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and immunity-related GTPase family M (IRGM), and cellular pathways, such as UPR and autophagy, during HCV infection. Although these cellular determinants are not stimulated by IFN, these factors critically control the host immune response. Therefore, these determinants may also play crucial roles in modifying HCV replication.",

However, this treatment is associated with side effects, and the efficacy of this regimen varies among genotypes, limiting the success rate of this treatment.34 Compared with genotype 2, infection with genotypes 1a and 1b results in more severe liver disease and low responsiveness to IFN therapy. Seventy-one percent of patients with genotype 2 infection respond to IFN therapy, whereas only 28% of genotype 1a and 26% of genotype 1b show a response.35 Patients infected with genotype 6 generally show higher sustained virological responses to IFN therapy than genotype 1-infected patients,36 whereas genotype 3-infected patients show a lower sustained virological response compared with genotype 1-infected patients.37 The heterogeneity of HCV genotypes also translates to differences in the manifestation of liver disease.38 For example, hepatic steatosis is most common in patients infected with genotype 3 and is attributed to its core protein.37 Recently, the use of active direct-acting antiviral molecules to block HCV infection has led to substantial improvements in sustained virological response rates in genotype 1-infected patients. However, the use of these drugs may allow selection of resistant variants if direct-acting antiviral monotherapy is adopted, and a high relapse rate occurs after direct-acting antiviral treatment is discontinued.39",

Unlike type I IFNs, which are elicited as a direct response to viral infection, IFN-\u03b3 is secreted by natural killer cells and mitogenically activated T cells.63 IFN-\u03b3 exerts potent anti-HCV activity in vitro and mediates antiviral T-cell responses. It has also been reported that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits HCV infection by downregulating claudin-1 and CD81.66 Type III IFNs consist of three members, termed IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 or IL-29 (\u03bb1) and IL-28A/B (\u03bb2/3). As with type I IFNs, viral infection also directly activates type III IFNs. However, the antiviral properties and the mechanisms of action of type III IFNs remain unknown. Type III IFNs can be secreted by many cell types, but their receptors show a limited tissue distribution.63 HCV infection results in type III IFN induction predominantly in the human liver. Despite modulation by the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathways for induction of type III and type I IFNs, these two systems upregulate distinct subsets of ISGs with different kinetics of induction.67",

TLR7 and TLR9 bind to myeloid differentiation pro-inflammatory response 88 (MyD88) and activate IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and TRAF6, followed by the activation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, which in turn activates NF-\u03baB through phosphorylation, polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its associated inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1. Migration of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus results in IFN production (Figure 3).70",

In turn, IFN activates the transcription of RIG-I, hence forming a positive feedback loop for amplifying antiviral signals.123 Studies have shown that RIG-I is essential for eliciting an immune response against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and hepatitis C virus.72,124,125 Knockout of the RIG-I gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts severely limits type I IFN production and ISG activation, thereby potentiating viral replication; conversely, overexpression of RIG-I restricts viral replication.72 In addition, upregulation of RIG-I gene expression has been observed in IFN-treated human dendritic cells, suggesting that RIG-I serves as an ISG.126",

This results in the accumulation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane and the activation of IKK and TBK1, which, in turn, activates the transcription of NF-\u03baB, IRF3 and IRF7 to promote IFN production.123 Moreover, ubiquitination by TRIM25 also prevents CARDs from interacting with the helicase domain to reinstate the auto-inhibitory state.127 Ubiquitination at lysine 172 is crucial for RIG-I function because a mutation at this residue renders RIG-I unable to bind to MAVS, thus abrogating downstream signaling.128",

All of the elements of IFN responses, either innate or adaptive immunity, are regulated by IRF7.135 IRF7 is constitutively expressed in certain cells, such as macrophage and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, priming these cells for rapid IFN production.23 During infection, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 binds to its receptor and activates the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, resulting in IRF7 expression.23 Then, IRF7 is phosphorylated, forms a heterodimer with IRF3 and is translocated into the nucleus.136 In the nucleus, the IRF7-IRF3 heterodimer binds to the IRF elements in the promoter region of IFN-\u03b1 genes, leading to enhanced expression of the IFN-\u03b1 subtype and a diverse range of ISGs (Table 1).23,135 In turn, these events increase the abundance of RIG-I and viral PAMP signaling components, whereas sustained signaling serves to amplify IFN production.23,135 Moreover, IRF7 induces expression of other ISGs without activating IFN signaling.137 Thus, IRF7-mediated transcriptional cascades serve as an intrinsic antiviral mechanism allowing rapid ISG expression before IFN production.",

Karamichali et al.153 demonstrated that activated PKR or silencing PKR upregulates or downregulates HCV IRES activity (Table 1). These authors further showed that the inhibitory effect of NS5A on IRES-dependent translation occurs through PKR inactivation.153 In contrast, HCV can translate its viral protein via a bacterial-like pathway that uses eIF5B, which is an analog of bacterial IF2, and eIF3, instead of eIF2\u03b1 and its GTPase-activating protein eIF5, as the initiation factor (Table 1).154 The use of eIF2\u03b1-independent translation initiation provides an alternative tactic for HCV translation when eIF2\u03b1 is inactivated by phosphorylation under stress conditions.",

Moreover, knockdown of Ube1L, the E1 activating enzyme, inhibits HCV replication, particularly HCV egress, without affecting IFN-mediated ISG expression in HCV-infected cells.220 Using the HCV-Huh7.25.CD81 infection system, Arnaud et al. dissected the acute IFN response to HCV infection into early, PKR, and late, RIG-I, phases.221 HCV infection rapidly induces the expression of many IRF3-dependent genes, including ISG15, through a PKR-dependent mechanism before the RIG-I phase, which recruits MAVS.221 Then, ISG15 induction blocks HCV RNA-mediated RIG-I activation by inhibiting RIG-I ubiquitination, thereby negatively controlling the RIG-I/MAVS pathway.221 These studies illustrate that HCV may exploit ISG15 to antagonize host innate immunity and to promote viral replication.",

Consistent with these observations, Murray et al.227 demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 signaling and ISG induction were greatly increased when UPS18 was knocked down in both HCV SGR- and HCVcc-infected Huh7 cells.

For instance, viperin alters membrane fluidity by interacting with farnesyl diphosphate synthase, which is an enzyme essential for isoprenoid biosynthesis, thus disrupting the formation of lipid rafts, the sites of INFV budding, leading to interference with virus release from the cell surface.235 The induction of viperin into HIV-1-infected cells disrupts lipid rafts, causing viperin redistribution to CD81 compartments, where HIV-1 buds in human macrophages.236 The radical S-adenosyl-methionine enzymatic activity of viperin is required for the inhibition of HIV production.236 In cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus, the antiviral function of viperin is attenuated due to its degradation by the proteasome-mediated protein degradation system.237 In contrast, viperin enhances human cytomegalovirus infection through its interaction with the viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis vMIA protein, resulting in viperin relocalization from the ER to mitochondria.238 In mitochondria, viperin interacts with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein and reduces cellular ATP generation, resulting in the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and enhancement of the virus infection.238",

The anti-HCV function of viperin coincides with its binding to NS5A at the LD interface, whereas NS5A normally associates with the human homolog of the 33-kDa vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-33), which is a pro-viral cellular factor, at the viral replication complex.239 The interaction of HCV NS5A with hVAP-33 was previously shown to be critical for the formation of the viral replication complex.52 Therefore, the association between viperin and hVAP-33 requires both of their C-terminal domains, which then disturbs the interaction of hVAP-33 with NS5A and inhibits HCV replication (Table 1).241 Together, these findings imply that viperin hinders viral RNA replication by perturbing the interaction between hVAP-33 and NS5A.",

Many studies have also hitherto demonstrated that some of the identified ISGs can exert broad antiviral activities against a diverse spectrum of viruses, whereas other ISGs may have virus type-specific functions. The majority of studied ISGs mediate IFN antiviral activities, acting as negative regulators in virus replication. Strikingly, some ISGs function as negative modifiers in the innate immune response, thereby promoting virus replication. Nevertheless, the modes of action of most of the ISGs remain unclear. Although most identified ISGs target individual steps of virus replication, some ISGs seem to act at multiple stages of the virus replication cycle.

Clearly, different ISGs can additively or synergistically suppress HCV replication, suggesting that inhibiting HCV replication depends on the combinatorial effects of individual ISGs induced by IFN under the specific context of HCV infection.

Therefore, further deciphering which ISGs and/or IEGs are induced by IFNs upon HCV infection and the specificity and action of these ISGs and other cellular immune regulators on HCV replication will not only provide insights into how IFN functions to obstruct HCV replication but will also reveal novel cellular targets against which effective and efficacious anti-HCV therapeutics can be developed.",

Virus entry into cell proceeds through receptor-mediated endocytosis at the cell surface. Subsequent to internalization, the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane under acidic pH, and the viral genome is uncoated and released into the cytoplasm. To dissect these two events, internalization and fusion are conventionally depicted as two seemingly separate steps in the cytoplasm. Viral RNA is translated at the ER to produce the polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into mature structural and non-structural proteins. Viral non-structural proteins, in conjunction with host factors, form a membranous web where viral RNA replication occurs. HCV particle assembly most likely initiates near the ER and LD where core protein and viral RNA accumulate. Finally, HCV particles are secreted into the extracellular milieu via the secretory pathway.

(a) Upon binding to dsRNA, TLR interacts with its associated adapter protein TRIF and recruits TRAF, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, thereby transmitting signals downstream to phosphorylate IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus to induce the expression of target genes such as IFN. TLR also binds to MyD88 and activates IRAK, TRAF6 and IKK. These events activate NF-\u03baB and IRF3, resulting in IFN production. (b) After sensing and binding to dsRNA, RIG-I interacts with MAVS. This interaction promotes the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 and activates gene transcription through IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In addition, TRAF3, TRAF6 and MEKK1 are recruited to MAVS to activate NF-\u03baB. The canonical IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 induce NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription via phosphorylation, polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in the release and nuclear migration of NF-\u03baB. Then, activated NF-\u03baB stimulates the gene expression of IFN and inflammatory cytokines together with other cellular factors, such as activating transcription protein 2 and c-Jun.
