            "text": "Nineteenth-century Italian anthropologist and criminology and forensic psychiatry pioneer Cesare Lombroso is notorious for his idea (first published in Italian in 1876, see Parmelee, 1911) that crime originates from specific individual anomalies, and that a scientific mapping of these should be used for preventive criminal policy purposes. Ideally, \u2018criminal science\u2019 should facilitate early identification of \u2018moral insanity\u2019 to foresee which individuals risk developing criminal behaviour and to instigate suitable therapeutic, preventive or mitigating action (Lombroso, 1911; Parmelee, 1911). Lombroso\u2019s own specific ideas, as those of his US parallel Isaac Ray (1861), regarding the purely biological nature of the causes of crime were criticized early on for paying too little attention to psychological and social factors (Ellwood, 1912), and the very idea of a biological explanation of crime was criticized for undermining the institution of criminal justice (Gray, 1858).1 A student of Lombroso, Enrico Ferri (1895), who shared Lombroso\u2019s basic assumption that criminal behaviour results from factors behind the individual\u2019s control, included social factors as possible causes for criminality, as may indeed have been Lombroso\u2019s own intention (Gibson, 2002). This view was also endorsed by the Swedish psychiatrist Olof Kinberg (1935), who argued that crime could and should be prevented by detaining the very sick criminals, try to treat those who can be treated, but also to reform society to eradicate poverty and ignorance.",

            "text": "The broader Lombrosian vision of using a scientific theory of the causes of crime for early identification of individuals at risk of becoming criminals and enforcing preventive action upon them, continued to inspire criminologists, psychiatrists and policymakers throughout the first half of the 20th century. It was, for instance, a visible ingredient in the eugenic policies implemented throughout the Western world in the 20th century (Broberg and Roll-Hansen, 2005; Lombardo, 2010). During the 1950s to 1970s, such ideas fell into both scientific and political disrepute, to the benefit of structural political action targeting socio-economic background factors of criminality or a contentedness with the traditional measure of threatening would-be offenders with retrospective punishment. However, from the beginning of the 21st century, the Lombrosian vision has resurfaced, in the wake of advances of behavioural genetics, neuroscience and psychiatric and criminological epidemiology (Andrews, 1999; Ferguson and Beaver, 2009; Ferguson 2010; Falk et al., 2014, Raine, 2013, Glenn and Raine, 2014). In a fresh overview of the novel field of neurocriminology, it is thus typically stated:\nFrom a public-health perspective, applications of neurobiological research on violence at the population level relatively early in life may help to prevent adult violence.

            "text": "This return of the Lomrosian vision in contemporary science has attracted some critical attention in mass media (Cohen, 2011; Tallis, 2013), but has so far received sparse scrutiny from ethical standpoints. Horsk\u00f6tter has commented on versions of the Lombrosian vision targeting children and psychopathy (Horstk\u00f6tter and de Wert, 2013; Horstk\u00f6tter et al., 2014), and there has been some interest from scholars within the rapidly growing field of neurolaw (e.g. S\u00f8birk Petersen, 2014). Most of this latter field, however, focus on the possible impact of neuroscientific findings on legal responsibility and legal practices more generally (Aharoni et al. 2008; Vincent, 2013, 2014). The lack of research on ethical implications of the new Lombrosian vision may be due to the intricacies of applying standard bioethics perspectives to areas where health care and medicine is put to serve the legal system, such as forensic psychiatry (Appelbaum, 2008; Munthe et al., 2010). However, the general notion of broad screening programmes for the purpose of advancing general societal values actualize particular ethical complexities (Juth and Munthe, 2012), and the very idea of basing both penal and preventive criminal policy on forensic psychiatric risk assessment brings both scientific and ethical hazards of its own (Nilsson et al., 2009). At the same time, just as it did in the 19th century, the idea of switching said policy to a mode of prevention rather than one that is met within the range of criminal sanctions, may seem the logical step given that crimes can be explained by factors outside the offenders\u2019 control and thus be used to challenge the very idea of retribution (Gray, 1858; Raine, 2013; Glenn and Raine, 2014). This article aims to facilitate further specific inquiry into this intersection of bio, legal and social ethics by providing a critical overview of the new Lombrosian vision from a public health perspective and to review some central ethical issues actualized by its general idea of forensic screening programmes2 for early detection of individuals who are at risk of committing crimes to target with preventive or mitigating measures.",

We note some uncertainties both with regard to scientific hypotheses assumed and to the effectiveness of proposed preventive strategies. However, faith in such assumptions and actions may nevertheless prevail, adding further complexity to ethical analysis and motivating more in-depth inquiry also in cases of what may on the surface look like less realistic ideas. On this basis, we describe 27 strategy types for how the new Lombrosian vision may take concrete form and, in section 3, analyse these from the perspective of general ethical concerns regarding screening and the intersection of medicine and criminal law policy. We hereby identify an underlying nest of general ethical issues, further discussed in section 4. This concerns the balancing of risks of negative side effects\u2014well known from the bioethical discussion of screening programmes\u2014against possible benefits described mostly in non-health terms and linking to the institutional values of criminal law. The result is summed up in section 5, noting that our analysis, rather than delivering a proposed solution, results in a theoretical framework for further, more specific ethical analysis of the intersection of criminal and public health policy, in particular, the idea of medical population screening programmes for the purpose of preventing violent crime.",

The most daring idea present is that of F consisting of genetic factors determining or substantially influencing criminality. Such a T would allow detection of F even before birth, implantation or, ultimately, even conception of I, using methods for preconception, preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing or risk assessment already in clinical use. That, in turn, would facilitate a P of the same form applied already today for family planning on genetic grounds, using partner, gamete or embryo or foetus selection to avoid possible future Is where F is present. Less probably, it may also provide a basis for therapeutic preventive interventions preconceptionally or prenatally. But, of course, a genetic explanation of crime may also ground other types of P (see further below).",

Research has continued to look for specific genes associated with criminal behaviour, but despite the unanimous evidence that genetic effects are involved (adoption and twin studies have shown that hereditary factors explain about 65% of the difference in risk for aggressive antisocial behaviour (Burt, 2009)), it has proved exceedingly difficult to pin precise behaviour patterns on specific molecular genetic variants (Lee et al., 2013; Vassos et al., 2014). A typical problem, illustrated by a recent, highly publicized study (Tiihonen et al., 2014), is that specific mutations found in offender populations may, first, be widespread also among non-offenders and, secondly, surrounded by an innumerable complex of confounding factors not controlled for. The evidence for a strong genetic explanation of the wider phenomenon of \u2018antisocial personality and behaviour\u2019 may at the moment look more compelling (Ferguson, 2010). However, such explanations typically use diagnoses already conceptually assuming criminality or antisocial violence, making the suggested causal mechanism behind criminality (i.e. the conditions in question) imply circularity, and when sources of that are discounted for, the correlation between mental disorder and forensic risk tends to disappear (Anckars\u00e4ter et al., 2009, Nilsson et al., 2009).5",

No evidence presently suggests that one single gene, or even a neat combination of a few ones, could be found that controls a certain behaviour, but rather that behaviour is influenced by a great number of genes working together in close interaction with complex environmental factors. This picture may come to change somewhat as biobank-based big data and large-scale epidemiological approaches to behavioural genomics are applied further (Nuffield Council of Bioethics, 2002; Simmons, 2008), and psychiatric taxonomy is developed to allow multi-step inferences from genetic explanations of conditions to causal explanations of relevant behaviour types.6",

Even if there is a significant degree of interaction between genetic and environmental factors, the latter may be specific enough to still allow for early detection together with genetic analyses (Pettersson et al., 2013). If the thus predicted symptoms also substantially increase the risk of future criminality, a genetic T has been established. However, even without the genetic component, neuroscientific findings may by themselves serve as a T. This is the new Lombrosian vision of neurocriminology (Raine, 2013; Glenn and Raine, 2014), where particular neuobiological phenomena are thought to be substantial parts of the cause of criminality, thus possible to detect in order to assess the risk of future criminal behaviour. Such a T would not facilitate the far-reaching prospect of selecting against future people on the basis of forensic risk promised by the genetic approach, albeit some structures might possibly be available for inspection prenatally.",

Epidemiological studies using large samples have shown that a comparatively small group of individuals commit a large proportion of all violent crimes and that individuals in this group have exhibited disinhibitory behaviour early in life (Moffit and Caspi, 2001; Moffitt et al., 2002; Farrington et al., 2013). In a recent large Swedish longitudinal study (Falk et al., 2014) comprising 2,393,765 individuals, epidemiological analysis of data from multiple registers was used to isolate a very small portion of individuals responsible for a very large portion of persistent violent criminality, and these individuals were then typed in terms of various conditions and analysed further in comparisons to controls. The authors conclude:\nThe vast majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by a small number of persistent violent offenders, almost all males, who have an early onset of violent criminality and display substance use problems, personality disorders, and nonviolent criminality. These findings support the provision of far-reaching interventions among young individuals who have committed one or two violent crimes and are at risk of developing persistent violent criminal behavior.

These variants range from the ambitious project of prenatal or even preconceptual detection of Is with F throughout the entire population to the most restricted approach of further probing young criminal offenders to assess risk of recidivism. In between, we have strategies where subgroups of the population are approached for further inquiry, e.g. socio-economic groups, people living in areas burdened by increased or more serious criminality or people who have been diagnosed with certain conditions in health care or educational settings.11 The resulting nine variants may then be combined with three different intervention strategies (i.e. generic variations of P) to achieve the desired preventive effect, depending on the nature of T and F and the evidence for how the forensic risk may be reduced. Basically, there are three generic P approaches to achieve this: manipulating F (including F\u2019s influence on the risk) through treatment,12 manipulating I through restrictive measures (leaving F and its basic influence on body and mind untouched) or preventing the access of I to society through exclusion (in its most extreme form, implying that I never comes to exist).

Moreover, a variety of factors may make practitioners, policymakers and people in general perceive some Lombrosian strategy as promising or even ripe for implementation in spite of weak evidence. As we have seen from the quotations above, already the current scientific expertise in the field expresses strong temptations to this effect despite noting the frailty of the evidence base. This suggests a risk of enthusiasm overshadowing otherwise powerful objections that is far from unprecedented from a historical point of view. It is also easy to imagine the temptation for policymakers (as well as the general public) to reach for the sort of \u2018easy solutions\u2019 to loaded, complex societal problems held out by the Lombrosian vision and also here history teaches us that this may occur regardless of the actual scientific basis, besides veiling ethical complications. Thus, current standard opinions, e.g. that prenatal screening targeting some alleged criminality gene is out of the question, may change just as quickly as past eugenic stances once transformed into the more liberal views that currently prevail in this area of medicine. There is also a particular structural and institutional pull of screening solutions, due to the economic and status benefits for organizations of heading such programmes, that has been highlighted in the health context (Juth and Munthe, 2012: 2) and which seems no less likely in the new Lombrosian case. To the extent that a society is thus lured into setting up programmes of this sort despite wanting evidence, this will, of course, add to the ethical complications to be presented in the following sections.",

An analogous issue seems to appear in the new Lombrosian case, as a Lombrosian screening may choose between targeting either especially serious crimes (which are typically rare) or more commonly occurring offenses (typically less damaging to victims or society). It is quite conceivable that an I, who would (based on some T and F) be classified as high risk for a crime type that is serious in one of these senses, would not be high risk for crimes, which are serious in the other sense. As described in connection to the epidemiological approaches earlier, it may also be possible to identify targets, where severity and prevalence come together somewhat, such as in the case of persistent violent crime. The choice of target would, in any case, not only be a choice of what criminality is more important to prevent, it may also affect what people are being targeted, burdened, protected and so on. In all, therefore, this issue seems to be a very important one to address thoroughly for any sort of new Lombrosian approach to be justified.",

In a Lombrosian programme, something similar might hold, but only if detection of F and the following application of P is in the interest of I. Since P may mean that I\u2019s freedom is curtailed (restriction) or that I is barred entirely from society or even existence (exclusion), without any treatment being administered that benefits I by reducing risk while he/she is free and societally included, it may very well be in I\u2019s interest not to have F adequately identified. At the same time, there may remain an interest of society and of potential crime victims to correctly identify I as high risk, so that a P to reduce that risk may be applied, even if that implies downsides for I. False positives, in contrast, are problematic in a health screening mainly due to risks of unwarranted anxiety and risky or burdensome treatment. In the new Lombrosian case, the picture is similar in that an I falsely identified as possessing F risks being subjected to unmotivated measures.13 In contrast to the health case, however, these may, as we saw, be to the disbenefit of I even in the case of a true positive, with reasons referring to the protection of others and society motivating why they should nevertheless be applied. In the most extreme instance, there will be Is who never come to exist at all or who will be excluded from society due to a falsely attributed risk of future criminality. In addition, there is a general risk that the information about an increased forensic risk will by itself increase the same risk via psychological identification akin to stigmatization (see below), where I so identifies with the forensic labelling that actual criminality becomes more likely, so that the end result even with an effective treatment may be a zero effect or even worse.14",

This is the situation that, while risk factors for conditions may be determined, there are no or very few effective ways of mitigating these risks through treatment interventions.16 Since one strand of the new Lombrosian vision is walking the genetic path, this argument may be made by simply extending the well-known reasons from that field. In the neurobiological case, there is an uncertain and rather limited palette of invasive neuromedicine, so far basically untried in a new Lombrosian setting, some pharmacological treatments for various neuro-behavioural conditions with unsure effects on forensic risks and even less researched behavioural therapies (Glenn and Raine, 2014). There is currently no treatment method with a solid evidence base for treating individuals with persistent aggressive antisocial behaviour even if pharmacological treatment for ADHD, various treatments for substance-related problems and educational programmes for children with disruptive behaviour hold some promise (NICE, 2013, 2014; Glenn and Raine, 2014).

This is akin to draconian communicable disease management in situations when no cure for highly contagious and severe conditions exists, and isolation and quarantine become the remaining options to fight an epidemic. Although such steps may be justified by dire circumstances from a public health ethical standpoint, it has been argued that minimization (ideally avoidance) of restrictiveness should be a primary consideration also in communicable disease management and public health work (Gostin et al., 2003; Gostin, 2005). The most extreme version of exclusion approaches (the preconception or prenatal one) would attract a whole body of critique against eugenics.17 Presumably, Lombrosian restriction or exclusion programmes targeting children and young people would be open to similar charges of inhumanity. On the other hand, in cases of already active offenders, detected increased risk of recidivism may to many people be perceived as sound reason for increased restrictive measures, or even long-term incarceration, although critical ethical views could be lent on such \u201cpreventive detention\u201d arrangements as well (McSherry, 2014). An in-between position seems to hold for programmes targeting the group of young children displaying aggressive behaviour in combination with a lack of behavioural control, hyperactivity and difficulties interacting with others. They have already exhibited violent behaviour but, although it might be conceptualized as increasing the risk of repeated violent behaviour, it seems way too early labelling it as a type of recidivism motivating preventive restrictions of freedom or exclusion from society.18",

If we believe that the assessment of I as possibly dangerous warrants severely coercive or exclusionary measures, it is not so far-fetched to argue that the room for a person to refuse testing may be curtailed\u2014at least if there is some prior cause for suspicion. On the other hand, the variety of risks to both society and individuals of Lombrosian programmes sketched earlier may be framed inside the \u2018acquit rather than convict\u2019 logic of criminal jurisprudence, thus favouring a more cautious approach based on strong standards of pre-counselling and voluntary enrolment.

Such an analysis, moreover, would determine what concrete limits might be justified for effective new Lombrosian programmes, e.g. with regard to autonomy restrictions, on the basis of various suggested principles for assessing the ethics of public health and criminal law policy interventions.",

In criminal law, we find a deeply embedded jurisprudential ideal of letting clemency prevail, expressed by the burdens and standards of proof in criminal court proceedings applied even in the most gravest of crimes. In contrast, in public health policy, there is a much stronger tradition of accepting broken eggs to have the omelette\u2014at least when circumstances are dire. From these diverse standpoints, how should one assess, e.g., the opportunity of a programme that promises to prevent a substantial number of horrific crimes, but at the cost of a number of those more serious side effects pointed out earlier; in particular, the preventive, lengthy incarceration of a number of people who would, in fact, never have committed any criminal offenses whatsoever?

This may be a relevant consideration for the further probing of, e.g., the issue of what conditions or types of forensic risk to target, or what to require regarding the precision of detection methods and effectiveness of preventive interventions. At the same time, public opinion may be seen as posing a threat to the upholding of decent ethical principles.

Together with the unclarity of what safeguards against populist or single-minded excesses would be in place in a new Lombrosian context (where crime policy moves into the public health area), this makes for an unusually complex situation when deciding the basis for balancing the pros and cons of any more concrete new Lombrosian suggestion. At the same time, suppose there could be programmes offering at least some offenders who face long-term incarceration education, medication or surgery that could be scientifically shown to drastically and reliably reduce the risk of recidivism. What reason would there be to say no to that? We have indicated some, but the issue is far from simple.",
