Although peak forecasts were off by approximately 2 weeks, forecasts had\nstabilized before the peak occurred, suggesting that accuracy may be improved with\nrelatively simple adjustments in future; it may be that the persistent early peak\nprojections generated by IDEA reflect the fact that the IDEA curve is symmetrical, whereas\ninfluenza epidemic curves may (as in this case) drop off sharply after the peak is reached.\nThe IDEA model performed reasonably well in projecting final outbreak size. By early March\n2016, we were able to estimate a final size of 11002, compared with a total of 11 686 cases\nby the end of the outbreak, corresponding to error of approximately 6%, with final size\nestimates again having stabilized before the epidemic peak. However, confidence intervals\naround this estimate were wide with the upper bound confidence limit not dropping below\n15000 cases until mid-March (post-peak).",

The small number of cases reported from these areas was\nassociated with low estimates of R0. In general (and unsurprisingly), the smaller\nthe sample size of the jurisdiction under analysis, the less stable, reliable, and timely\nprojections appeared to be. Because frequency of testing or variability in testing practices\nmay contribute to small test-positive numbers, it is unfortunate that we lacked testing data\nfrom most jurisdictions, which might have permitted us to evaluate the impact of tests per\ncapita on usefulness of this modeling approach.
