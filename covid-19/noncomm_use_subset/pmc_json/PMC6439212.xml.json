Of these, an estimated 240 million individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) live in high to moderate endemic regions in Asia, sub-Sharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America (WHO, 2017). HBV is the smallest known DNA virus with a circular, double-stranded genome (\u223c3.2 kb) having four overlapped open reading frames encoding surface or envelope (S), core (C), pre-core (pre-C/e), polymerase/reverse-transcriptase (Pol/RT) and X proteins (Beck and Nassal, 2007). Very uniquely, HBV replicates its DNA via an RNA intermediate molecule through reverse-transcription, and hence nicknamed \u2018pararetrovirus\u2019.",

In addition, despite the global success of vaccinations, reports of vaccine-escape HBV mutants present another hurdle (Teo and Locarnini, 2010, Torresi, 2008). Moreover, in low-income countries, various political and socio-economic factors further hamper the prevention and control of CHB.",

A range of various plant metabolites are shown to impede virus replication without affecting the host physiology or with limited side-effects (Martin and Ernst, 2003, Hussain et al., 2017). In addition to their ability to interfere directly with viral replication, these natural products may also modulate the host immune response against infection (Kurokawa et al., 2010). In line with this, several natural or plant-derived compounds belonging to different chemical classes have been reported to have potential anti-HBV activities (Chen et al., 1995, Chang et al., 2005, Wang, 2000; Huang et al., 2008; Chou et al., 2012, Qiu and Chen, 2013, Wu, 2016, Parvez et al., 2016). Compared to interferons or lamivudine treatment, some plant products are reported with similar or even better efficacy (Chen and Zhu, 2013, Arbab et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2017). Interestingly therefore, approximately 80% of the CHB patients in China rely on traditional herbal medicines.",

All compounds were energy minimized using Universal Force Field (UFF). The compounds showing \u0394G \u2265 \u22126.0 kcal/mol were re-docked to HBV Pol to evaluate their detailed binding mechanisms using Autodock 4.2 as described elsewhere (Morris et al., 2009, Al-Yousef et al., 2017). For molecular docking, target protein and ligands were prepared as described elsewhere (Rehman et al., 2014, Rabbani et al., 2017). Briefly, the target model protein HBV Pol was prepared by removing any heterogeneous compounds and water molecules. Polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges were added to the protein using Autodock tool (ADT). Affinity grid maps were generated in such a way as to cover the complete active sites of the protein. Molecular docking was performed using Lamarkian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) to calculate the possible conformations of the ligands that bind to the target protein. Here, the ligand was set free to search and bind at the active site of the protein in the most favorable or minimum energy conformation. Initial positions and orientations of the ligands were set randomly while the torsions were set to a maximum of 6. Each run of the docking was performed to calculate 2,500,000 energy evaluations. The population size, translational step, quaternion and torsion steps were set to 150, 0.2 and 5 respectively. On the basis of binding energy (\u0394G), best docked structures were saved and analyzed for receptor-ligand interactions using Discovery Studio 4.0 (Accelrys Software Inc., 2012). The binding constant (Kb) for protein-ligand interaction was calculated using the following relation (Rehman et al., 2016): \u0394G=-RTlnKb (R = gas constant, 1.987 cal/mol/K; T = temperature, 298 K).",

Therefore, in natural infection, seropositivity of HBeAg is a hallmark of active viral DNA replication (Shafritz and Lieberman, 1984, Beck and Nassal, 2007).

Since the crystal structure of HBV Pol was not available, we used homology modeling to predict its three-dimensional structure.

We therefore, used the above sequence as query to search protein database for the identification of the most suitable template. Based on the primary sequence alignment (Fig. 6A), we used HIV-1 RT (PDB Id: 1RTD) as a template for HBV Pol homology modeling because the two viral proteins demonstrated highly conserved residues important for enzymatic activities. The homology model of HBV Pol was generated using the Swiss model server (Fig. 6B), and validated by Ramachandran plot. The Ramachandran plot showed 75.2% of the residues occupying the favored region, while 19.0% and 3.9% residues occupied the allowed and generously allowed region, respectively. Only, 2.0% of the residues were located in the disallowed outlier region (Fig. 5C).

            "text": "During the past decades, antiviral drug research technology has helped establish many efficacious anti-HBV drugs that eventually lead to emergence of drug-resistant strains. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural or plant products. Antiviral drug discovery and development passes through several stages, of which the in vitro cell culture systems and in silico molecular modeling represent first and fastest drug screening steps. Absence of a robust cell culture system for the propagation of HBV impeded the in vitro antiviral studies until the advent of HBV DNA cloning and establishment of stable cell lines. The HBV-reporter cell line, HepG2.2.15 is one of the established systems for preliminary screening of anti-HBV drugs. In the present study, the anti-HBV potential of specifically selected natural compounds was assessed by their inhibitory effects on HBsAg and HBeAg expressions in the HepG2.2.15 culture supernatants. Of these, quercetin, psoralen, baccatin III, menisdaurin, embelin and azadirachtin showed the high activities whereas lupeol, rutin, \u03b2-sitosterol and hesperidin had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. HBV Pol is the most important viral protein as potential drug-target despite emergence of drug-resistant mutations in and around the Pol/RT \u2018YMDD\u2019 motif (Locarnini et al., 2008). We used homology modeling to generate a 3-D structure of HBV Pol and validated it by Ramachandran plot wherein the \u2018YMDD\u2019 corresponded to the Tyr203, Met204, Asp205 and Asp206 residues. To further delineate the binding mechanism of the anti-HBV active compounds and lamivudine (ligands) to the modeled HBV Pol (receptor), we performed molecular docking. Docking of lamivudine indicated that it strongly interacted with the active site of HBV Pol through bonding with Pro59, Ala181, Ser202 and Ala181, forming a stable lamivudine-Pol complex with an estimated Gibb\u2019s free energy of \u22125.2 kcal/mol. Interestingly therein, the two Pol \u2018YMDD\u2019 motif residues, Tyr203 and Met204 were among the lamivudine surrounding amino acids.",
