The first has been the domestication of numerous animals for food production, as working animals for activities such as transport, and for hunting purposes. They are also, particularly in modern times, used as a source of companionship, and in the USA alone there are estimated to be over 77 million dogs.1 The second feature is our propensity to travel. This trait has accelerated in the modern age through technical innovations such as the motor car, air travel, and international shipping.2 Human travel through migration, leisure, or business continues to increase in parallel with a population increase and the spread of affluence. This provides opportunities for pathogens to move to new areas and cause outbreaks of disease. Commercial air travel has been particularly effective at transporting pathogens such as SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses.3 It is also contributing to the spread of disease vectors and the diseases they transmit.4 As we travel, we take animals with us either through trade in livestock or in the movement of companion animals.",

            "text": "When humans travel, they often take their companion animals, particularly dogs, and these in turn can relocate the pathogens and vectors they harbor. Canine parvovirus emerged in 1978 as a new disease in dogs causing hemorrhagic enteritis. Retrospective serology suggested that the disease appeared in Europe in 1976 and spread throughout the world by 1978.5 The mechanism that enabled global dissemination of the virus has been attributed to contaminated footwear. There are numerous canine-associated diseases but relatively few are significant zoonoses. However, of these, a number are fatal to humans and control is essential to protect public health. Globally, the most significant is the rabies virus. Infection leads to fatal encephalitis, for which there is no treatment.6,7 Pre-exposure vaccination protects against the disease in mammals, and due to the extended incubation period between contact with a rabid animal and development of disease, often measured in months, timely post-exposure vaccination is also effective in humans.8 The dog is the most important reservoir for the virus, and contact with dogs is responsible for virtually all human cases of the disease. Where efforts have been concentrated on controlling dog rabies, the reduction in human cases of disease has been dramatic.9 Dog rabies has been virtually eliminated from Europe, although there are examples of reintroduction10,11 and cross-border movement of rabid animals.12",

It is a fatal condition that is relatively rare in Europe although there are clear areas of endemicity, resulting in human infections in an area of Europe ranging from France in the west to Austria in the east.13 The disease manifests as a tumor-like growth of cysts containing the larval stage of the parasite in organs such as the liver. Detection of cysts often occurs many years after initial infection, and without intervention such as surgery to remove the cyst(s), the disease is fatal. Dogs act as the definitive host for the adult form of the parasite and movement of infected dogs can lead to the spread of tapeworm eggs and introduction of the disease into new areas. As the adult worm is very small (less than 5 mm) and does not cause clinical signs in the definitive host, spreading of eggs and human infection can remain undetected until clinical symptoms develop.",

A similar situation is likely to exist for most EU member states. In addition to this, there is the problem of illegal movement of animals either by organized groups for commercial purposes or inadvertent contraventions of legal requirements by holidaymakers through importation of their animals.

            "text": "Rabies is a progressive encephalitis that is invariably fatal. It is caused by viruses of the genus lyssavirus, of which the type species is the rabies virus.18 All mammals are susceptible to the disease, but only a small number are capable of acting as a reservoir species; key among these is the domestic dog. Infected animals shed virus into saliva, and transmission occurs following a bite from a rabid animal, usually a reservoir host. This allows the virus to bypass physical barriers, such as clothing and skin, leading to infection of peripheral nerves. Once the virus infects the central nervous system, the infected host begins to show signs of the disease and therapeutic options are limited to experimental approaches that have not proven successful.19 However, the period between contact with a rabid animal and invasion of the central nervous system is sufficiently long to allow effective post-exposure vaccination that can, if administered shortly after contact, prevent development of disease.20 Access to the rabies vaccine, even in rabies-free countries where human cases occur regularly due to exposure overseas,21 is essential to protect against developing disease. Post-exposure vaccination is also recommended for bites from bats that transmit rabies virus in the Americas and non-rabies lyssaviruses in the rest of the world.22 This includes the bat lyssaviruses found in the European insectivorous bat populations. However, the efficacy of current vaccines against the full range of viruses within the genus is not complete due to antigenic variation between the rabies virus23 used to formulate veterinary and human vaccines and the more divergent lyssaviruses.24",

This recently occurred in Italy in 2008 and required repeated oral vaccination campaigns over 3 years to regain freedom from the disease.29 Occasional cases of dog rabies are reported in Eastern Europe.30,31 These may represent spill-over infection from red fox populations, although there is also the possibility that pockets of dog rabies persist in some urban areas. There is also the risk of introducing rabies through accidental importation where a dog may be incubating virus without showing signs of disease and through illegal movement of dogs. In 2008, an animal charity relocated a group of stray animals from Sri Lanka to the UK. One of these animals developed convulsions and died shortly after arrival in a UK quarantine facility and was confirmed to be rabid, leading to the destruction of a further four dogs that may have been in contact with the animal.32 Illegal importation of animals into the EU presents more of a challenge to veterinary authorities. A survey of cases where rabies was imported into the EU and Switzerland showed that most resulted from tourists transporting dogs, mainly puppies, from North Africa into Spain, and then driving them up into countries further north.33 One case involved the illegal movement of a puppy in hand luggage in a flight into Hannover airport in Germany. The frequency of such incidents has highlighted the risk of illegally importing rabid dogs from North Africa,34 which can lead to the loss of rabies-free status if a rabid animal has free movement within EU member states.",

            "text": "Echinococcosis results from infection with the larval stages of cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus.37 Two species are commonly associated with disease in humans, ie, E. granulosus, which is found worldwide, and E. multilocularis, which has a restricted distribution and causes alveolar echinococcosis. E. multilocularis is found in the northern hemisphere in parts of Western Europe, Asia, and North America, particularly the western coastal regions of Alaska. The species belongs to the family Taeniidae. It exists in a two-host life cycle, parasitizing wild canids such as the red fox as definitive hosts of the adult form and prey species, which act as an intermediate host for the larval stage. Intermediate hosts include species such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis). Adult tapeworms, 2\u20134 mm in length, develop in the small intestine of the definitive host, and then shed eggs persistently for up to 5 months. The eggs contaminate the environment and are resistant to desiccation and low temperatures.38 This enables egg survival for extended periods. Intermediate hosts ingest the eggs which hatch in the intestine to release metacestodes. These attach to the intestinal wall, cross it, and then migrate from the intestine via the bloodstream to organs such as the liver where they form hydatid cysts into which protoscoleces bud. Upon ingestion of the intermediate host by a fox, the protoscoleces develop into an adult stage, enabling attachment to the intestinal wall and the life cycle is complete. All mammals can develop alveolar cysts following ingestion of eggs, and these continue to develop to the extent that infected organs, particularly the liver and lungs, are destroyed and the host dies. Treatment in humans is limited to surgery to excise cysts, although this carries risks if the cyst bursts, leading to metastases that cause further cysts, or pharmacological therapy with albendazole.39 Within endemic areas, human contact is limited to those having a close association with animals, such as hunters. However, dogs can act as a definitive host and contaminate areas where humans may come into contact with parasite eggs. Therefore, owning a dog can be considered a risk factor for infection with E. multilocularis in endemic regions.",

Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of extensive alveolar cysts within the liver of one animal.47 This animal was one of a pair imported from Germany, specifically a region endemic for the disease, but had been held within an enclosure that excluded potential definitive hosts, so the UK is still considered free of the disease. Qualitative assessment has concluded that the risk of introduction of the disease through further beaver importation from endemic countries is low.48",

The disease comes in two forms, ie, cutaneous, affecting the skin, and visceral, with involvement of internal organs. The disease can be caused by up to 20 species of Leishmania. The most prevalent cause of zoonotic disease is L. infantum.1 The principal means of transmission in Europe is through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, eg, Phlebotomus perniciosus, which inoculates a mammalian host with Leishmania protozoa. In South America, Leishmania is transmitted by phlebotomine flies belonging to the genus Lutzomyia. Skin lesions form at the site of the insect bite and progressively increase in size to the point where they can be disfiguring.49 Visceral leishmaniasis with widespread dissemination of the Leishmania protozoa is more serious, and can be fatal in humans if untreated. Dogs are particularly susceptible to infection with L. infantum, often causing fatalities,50 and if suspected, the dog should be treated aggressively to control the infection. A range of treatments are available, including meglumine antimoniate, aminosidine, and miltefosine, although each carries a range of side effects.50 Unfortunately, these drugs are not uniformly available across Europe.",

Details of the treatments must be recorded in either a pet passport or a third country certificate. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to return of the animal to the country of origin, confinement of the animal until such time that the conditions are reached, or in extreme circumstances, destruction of the animal. Movement between EU member states only requires identification of the animal and rabies vaccination, followed by a 21-day waiting period. All companion animals entering the UK with their owners on an approved route are checked for compliance with the rules of the EU pet travel scheme. Until December 31, 2011, the UK, Sweden, and Malta required additional serological testing for a rabies titer and a 6-month waiting period, tapeworm treatment prior to entry, and treatment for ticks for pets from the EU and listed third countries. Pets from unlisted third countries had to comply with the 6-month quarantine requirement. Before the introduction of the pet travel scheme in February 2000, quarantine for 6 months was applied to all dogs and cats entering the UK.62 During the existence of the pet travel scheme (2000\u20132012), 80,000\u201390,000 dogs and around 8,000 cats entered the country each year (Table 1). Harmonization in 2012 removed the need for serological testing for dogs, cats, and ferrets entering from EU member states, although this is still in place for unlisted third countries. The new scheme stimulated an increase in entry of companion animals (Table 1).",

This again requires compliance by the public and vigilance at border points. However, these are never perfect, so each member state needs to be able to provide a robust response to potential outbreaks. For the example of rabies, this would involve contact tracing of any humans and animals that could have been infected by the index case. Humans can be offered post-exposure vaccination, and animals with potential contact with a diseased animal would be assessed and receive vaccination and confinement until their health status could be confirmed. All these measures were applied when a rabid dog was brought into France from Morocco.35 Underpinning all disease responses is a diagnostic service capable of rapid detection of pathogens. This could be organized at the member state level or by regional centers that service a number of countries. A further useful activity would be accurate risk mapping of disease distribution so that particular pathways for introduction of pathogens can be identified and prevented. In this endeavor, bodies such as the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the European Centre for Disease Control, can play a critical role in documenting the incidence of a disease, mapping its geographical distribution and making this information accessible to the general public.",
