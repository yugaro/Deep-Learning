Both the absolute levels and the balance between different NTs are critical for genome stability (Pai and Kearsey, 2017). Therefore, to survive the fluctuation in NT levels due to changes in diet or internal NT metabolic conditions, animals are expected to have evolved cellular mechanisms that sense and respond to NT level changes. Although there have been extensive studies regarding the impact of nucleotide imbalance on cell-cycle progression, DNA replication, and genome stability mainly using cultured cells or yeast (Pai and Kearsey, 2017), the mechanisms that regulate developmental and metabolic events in animal models in response to NT changes are underexplored.",

We showed that the commonly used Caenorhabditis elegans food, Escherichia coli OP50 strain, provides less dietary pyrimidine than some other E. coli strains, such as the commonly used E. coli HT115 strain that has altered nucleotide metabolism (Chi et al., 2016). Cytidine deaminases CDD-1 and CDD-2 catalyze the conversion of cytidine NTs to uridine NTs. The combination of a CDD double-knockout mutant worm and a diet of E. coli OP50 leads to a significantly reduced thymidine pool, which causes a completely sterile phenotype due to the arrest of mitotic germline proliferation (Chi et al., 2016). Further analysis also implicates a likely nucleotide-sensing system in the intestine that regulates not only mitotic germline proliferation but also NT metabolism when animals encounter genotoxic stress due to NT deficiency or imbalance.",

One of the suppressors we isolated, ku544, effectively suppressed the sterile phenotype (Figure 1A) and fully restored the germline morphology of the double mutant (100% wild type [WT], n = 200) (Figure S1A) (Chi et al., 2016). We were not able to test the brood size as both cddko worms fed with pyrimidine-rich cytR\u2212 bacteria and the suppressor strain showed severe egg-laying defects (Figures S1B and S1C). We thus indirectly examined fecundity by counting the eggs in adult animals. Our previous study showed feeding with high pyrimidine food (cytR\u2212 bacteria) strongly suppressed the germline proliferation defects of cddko animals (Chi et al., 2016). We found that adult cddko; ku544 animals contained a similar amount of eggs as adult cddko animals fed cytR\u2212 bacteria (4-day-old cddko; ku544 animals on OP50, 26 \u00b1 2.7 eggs per worm; 4-day-old cddko on cytR\u2212, 26.8 \u00b1 4.6 eggs per worm; n = 9 each; p = 0.67, unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t test). These results indicate that ku544 is a strong suppressor of germline defects in cddko animals.",

            "text": "Genetic mapping and genome sequencing determined that ku544 is a C-to-T mutation in the endu-2 gene, which encodes a homolog of EndoU (endoribonuclease specific for uridylate) that has been linked to diverse physiological functions in multiple organisms (see Discussion). An alignment between ENDU-2 and its homolog in Xenopus and humans (Laneve et al., 2008; Renzi et al., 2006) demonstrated that all of the amino acids that are critical for its enzymatic activity are conserved in C. elegans (Figure S1D). Our ku544 mutation results in a T568I change in the ENDU-2 protein (Figure S1D). Mutating the corresponding threonine in XendoU (T278) caused an ~80% reduction in nuclease activity in an in vitro assay (Renzi et al., 2006), suggesting that the suppressor phenotype of endu-2(ku544/T568I) is likely due to a disruption of the nuclease activity of the enzyme. To provide further support for this notion, we created an endu-2(H470A) mutation, which was predicted to abolish the active site (Renzi et al., 2006) (Figure S1D). Consistently, while expressing a WT endu-2 transgene (Ex[endu-2]) in the cddko; endu-2(T568I) triple mutant reversed the suppressing effect of endu-2(T568I), a mutant endu-2(H470A) transgene (Ex[endu-2(H470A)]) failed to reverse the suppression (Figure 1A). Therefore, the loss of ENDU-2 nuclease activity recovers fertility that was shut down in C. elegans cddko worms fed low-pyrimidine food. In other words, WT ENDU-2 is critically involved in animals\u2019 response to a deficiency in the pyrimidine pool. To simplify the presentation, we hereafter refer to the endu-2(ku544/T586I) allele as endu-2(\u2212).",

Strong expression was detected in the intestine (Figure 1B), which is consistent with a previous analysis using a multi-copy translational fusion GFP reporter (Ujisawa et al., 2018). However, no detectable fluorescence was seen in the germline. More important, expressing endu-2 specifically in the intestine of the cddko; endu-2(\u2212) triple mutant using an intestine-specific promoter (Pges-1) reversed the rescue (Figure 1A), suggesting that ENDU-2 activity in the gut is sufficient to execute its role in germline proliferation arrest in the cddko mutant.",

This defect was significantly enhanced in NT-treated worms. When endu-2(\u2212) worms were supplemented with 100 mM cytidine, nearly 60% of the worms showed the DNA bridge defect (Figure 1H). The DNA bridge defects were also slightly enhanced in endu-2(\u2212) worms treated with HU (Figure 1H). The occurrence of DNA bridges is an indicator of chromosomal damage and has been shown to be caused by mutations in DNA damage response genes in C. elegans (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2004; Kniazeva and Ruvkun, 2019). Our results suggest that ENDU-2 is necessary for successful mitosis in many intestinal cells, which is consistent with a role for ENDU-2 in the DNA damage response.",

The endu-2(\u2212) mutation significantly restored the dTTP:dCTP ratio in the cddko background (Figure 2A), suggesting that ENDU-2 affects pyrimidine metabolism, which may be largely responsible for the suppression of sterility. In contrast, the endu-2(\u2212) single mutant did not cause a significant change in the dTTP:dCTP ratio (Figure S2A), suggesting that ENDU-2 significantly affects relevant NT metabolic pathways only when NT metabolism is disturbed. To identify factors that act downstream of ENDU-2 to mediate its role in regulating pyrimidine metabolism, we carried out a candidate RNAi screen of pyrimidine metabolism genes (Figure S2B) and discovered a genetic interaction between endu-2 and ctps-1. ctps-1 encodes a homolog of CTPS that catalyzes the conversion of uridine triphosphate (UTP) to CTP (Figure S2B). CTPS has critical roles in NT metabolism (see Discussion). When WT worms were treated with ctps-1 RNAi, they showed a strong \u201cgermless\u201d phenotype (>93%; Figures 2B and 2C). These \u201cgermless\u201d worms were sterile, with very small germlines that contained a few undifferentiated germ cells (Figure 2B). Reducing the strength of RNAi by diluting ctps-1(RNAi) 5-fold with control (HT115) RNAi bacteria led to a reduction in the percentage of germless worms (~50%; Figure 2C). The endu-2(\u2212) mutation enhanced the phenotype by diluted ctps-1(RNAi) as ctps-1(RNAi); endu-2(\u2212) worms produced a higher percentage of germless worms than that caused by ctps-1(RNAi) alone. Conversely, endu-2 overexpression (oe) had a suppression effect on diluted ctps-1(RNAi), as ctps-1(RNAi); endu-2(oe) worms produced lower percentages of germless worms than that caused by ctps-1(RNAi) alone (Figure 2C). These data, including the similarity in loss-of-function phenotypes and phenotype enhancements, suggest that endu-2 and ctps-1 may act either in the same pathway or in parallel pathways to affect germline development and genotoxic responses.",

To create a more sensitive condition to observe the function of ctps-1, we diluted HT115 RNAi bacteria with E. coli OP50. cddko worms fed this OP50-diluted RNAi food had disorganized germlines due to the reduction in pyrimidine level (Figure S2C). Both OP50-diluted endu-2(RNAi) and OP50-diluted ctps-1(RNAi) partially rescued the germline defects in cddko worms (Figure 2D), suggesting that endu-2 and ctps-1 may function in the same pathway. Consistent with this notion, ctps-1(RNAi) also sensitized worms to HU treatment (Figure 2E) and the increased incidence of DNA bridges (Figure 2F).

The search for post-translational modifications identified phosphorylations but not acetylation or ubiquitination of CTPS-1 (Figure S3B). Among the 3 identified phosphorylation sites, only phosphorylation of S532 was clearly repressed by the ENDU-2 activity (Figure S3B). Furthermore, we created the \u201cphospho-dead\u201d form of CTPS-1 in endu-2(\u2212) mutants by introducing an S532A mutation. This mutation was found to suppress the hypersensitivity of endu-2(\u2212) to HU treatment (Figure 3E) and the increased incidence of DNA bridges in endu-2(\u2212) (Figure S3C), supporting the idea that the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 at S532 largely mediates the function of ENDU-2. Because endu-2(\u2212) worms have phenotypes similar to those of ctps-1(RNAi) (suppression of cddko germline defects, hypersensitive to HU treatment, and increased number of intestine DNA bridges) (Figures 1 and 2), the above data suggest that ENDU-2 may regulate CTPS-1 by repressing CTPS-1 phosphorylation, which in turn represses the CTPS activity (Figure 3F).",

ATGL-1 is a direct target of intestinal PKA, and an atgl-1::gfp reporter strain has been used previously as a reporter of intestinal PKA activity (Lee et al., 2014). We treated the atgl-1::gfp reporter strain with endu-2 RNAi and observed a significant increase in GFP fluorescence in the intestine (Figures 4C and S4C), supporting the fact that intestine PKA activity is increased in endu-2(\u2212) mutants. The PKA pathway is known to be activated by an increased cytosolic cyclic AMP (cAMP) level (Sassone-Corsi, 2012). We found that the overall cAMP level was modestly but significantly increased in endu-2(\u2212) worms (Figure 4D). It is likely that the increase in cAMP level in the intestine of endu-2(\u2212) worms is much larger than the observed overall cAMP level change, since our data presented earlier (e.g., Figures 1A and 4A) suggest that ENDU-2 acts in the intestine for CTPS-1 phosphorylation and the roles on NT metabolism.",

C. elegans has 4 acy genes, acy-1\u2013acy4, and knocking down any acy gene in the endu-2(\u2212) background leads to reduced CTPS-1 phosphorylation (Figure 4E). The expression of all 4 genes was increased in endu-2(\u2212), but only changes in acy-1 and acy-2 were statistically significant (Figure 4F). It is important to note that all 4 genes are expressed in multiple tissues and that their expression levels in the intestine are weak (Govindan et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012). Therefore, the effect of ENDU-2 on any of these acy genes specifically in the intestine could be significantly stronger than the difference shown in Figure 4F. Our data support the model in which ENDU-2 represses the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 at least in part by repressing PKA activity in the intestine, and the latter may be achieved at least partly through repressing the expression of acy genes and cAMP level change in the intestine.",

HU treatment diminishes dNTP pools, stalls DNA replication, and causes a replication checkpoint-dependent cell-cycle arrest (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2010). Response to HU therefore could be attributed to NT level changes and/or the downstream checkpoint activation. In adults, the germline contains only dividing cells. The elimination of dividing cells using a glp-1 loss-of-function [glp-1(e2141)] mutant (Kodoyianni et al., 1992) abolished the induction of endu-2 by HU (Figure 6E), suggesting that the endu-2 response requires cell division in adults. chk-1 is required for replication checkpoint activation in early embryos and in the germline. chk-1 RNAi also induces DNA bridge formation (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2010). chk-1 RNAi abolished the endu-2 mRNA response to HU in adults but not in larvae (Figure 6F), suggesting that endu-2 is induced by HU through replication checkpoint activation in the germline in adults. It is important to note that endu-2 is not expressed in the germline. Therefore, the signal from checkpoint activation in the germline needs to be relayed to the intestine. endu-2 induction in larvae by HU was not affected by eliminating the germline or by chk-1 RNAi (Figures 6E and 6F), which is consistent with the transcriptional silencing of checkpoint signaling genes, including chk-1, in the majority of somatic cells (Vermezovic et al., 2012). In this case, endu-2 may be induced by HU through checkpoint-independent pathways or by NT level changes directly. To further examine the relations between endu-2 and ctps-1, we also tested the mRNA level of endu-2 in ctps-1(S532A) animals treated with HU. We found that abolishing CTPS-1 phosphorylation by the ctps-1(S532A) mutation did not affect the induction of endu-2 expression by HU (Figure S5A), which is consistent with the proposal that ctps-1 works downstream of endu-2.",

We examined the EndoU mRNA level and found that it was significantly increased after HU treatment in HeLa cells (Figure 6G), indicating that the expression of this enzyme is also induced by genotoxic stresses in mammalian cells. We then observed that EndoU RNAi treatment greatly enhanced the sensitivity of HeLa cells to 5-FU and FUDR (Figures 6H, S5B, and S5C), which is consistent with a likely role of EndoU in genotoxic stress response in mammalian cells.",

The RNA-binding and endoribonuclease activities of EndoU family members were first shown in Xenopus by in vitro assays (Laneve et al., 2003; Renzi et al., 2006) and have since been confirmed in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (Ivanov et al., 2004; Laneve et al., 2008, 2017; Michalska et al., 2018; Poe et al., 2014; Schwarz and Blower, 2014; Ujisawa et al., 2018). EndoU family members appear to be involved in many aspects of biology, including small nucleolar RNA biogenesis (Renzi et al., 2006), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network formation (Schwarz and Blower, 2014), immune response (Poe et al., 2014), neurodegeneration (Laneve et al., 2017), and viral replication (Ivanov et al., 2004), and as antibacterial toxins (Michalska et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2011). Human EndoU, also known as PP11 (placental protein 11), has been suggested to be a tumor marker because it is expressed in various tumors despite having no detectable expression in tissues other than the placenta (Laneve et al., 2008). In C. elegans, endu-2 has been shown to be one of many genes that alter expression in response to pathogen attack (Shapira et al., 2006) and play a role in the cold stress response (Ujisawa et al., 2018). Our results not only reveal a previously unknown role of EndoU in NT sensing and response but also provide mechanistic insights for such a specific function.",

We have shown previously that C. elegans actively shuts down germ cell proliferation by altering the GLP-1/Notch pathway in cddko mutant animals with a diminishing pyrimidine level (Chi et al., 2016). Here, we show that the loss of ENDU-2 function suppresses the germline shutdown by restoring the balance, indicating that the expression of ENDU-2 critically facilitates the shutdown of germ cell proliferation by preventing the changes that occurred in endu-2(\u2212) mutants. Therefore, ENDU-2 appears to act as a safeguard for healthy germline development by sensing the NT pool and other genotoxic stresses that threaten reproductive success. Under these suboptimal conditions, endu-2 is induced, as we have shown, to shut down germline development to prevent damage and preserve resources for when the aversive condition improves (Figure 6I). Critically, as we have shown, the function of ENDU-2 is partially mediated by histone deacetylase-1 (HDA-1), which has been shown to affect germline development via the GLP-1/Notch pathway (Dufourcq et al., 2002), establishing a direct connection between NT sensing and germline development.",

            "text": "Among different NTs, cytidine NTs have unique functional properties during cell proliferation. CTP has the lowest cellular concentrations among all of the ribonucleotide triphosphates (Traut, 1994). CTP is also required for phospholipid biosynthesis (Chang and Carman, 2008; Gibellini and Smith, 2010), which is needed for cell membrane expansion during and after cell division. CTPS catalyzes the conversion of UTP to CTP, the final step in the de novo synthesis of cytidine NTs. CTPS activity is elevated in various cancers (Kizaki et al., 1980; van den Berg et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1978) and is an attractive target for the development of antineoplastic, antiviral, and antiparasitic drugs (Hofer et al., 2001; Jordheim et al., 2013; Schimmel et al., 2007) and immunosuppressants (Martin et al., 2014). CTPS activity is regulated through interactions with all 4 ribonucleotide triphosphates, including the inhibition by its product CTP. CTPS exists as inactive dimers and forms tetramers when activated (Endrizzi et al., 2004).There are 2 isoforms of CTPS in humans, CTPS1 and CTPS2. Both isoforms are regulated by phosphorylation (Chang et al., 2007; Han et al., 2005; Higgins et al., 2007; Kassel et al., 2010), but it is unknown whether and how the phosphorylation of CTPS is involved in the cellular stress response, especially in response to altered NT profiles. Previous studies have also found that CTPS can form large filamentous structures called cytoophidia in cells in various organisms, which is known to modulate CTPS activity and stability (Liu, 2016; Lynch et al., 2017). In addition, CTPS phosphorylation may affect the ability to form cytoophidia. The significance of forming cytoophidia regarding specific physiological functions remains to be investigated.",

While additional studies are needed to reach a firm conclusion regarding the role of CTPS-1 phosphorylation, the proposed model is supported by the data mentioned above. Several critical mechanistic questions remain to be addressed before creating a more comprehensive model for ENDU-2-mediated regulation of NT metabolism and germline development in response to NT deprivation or imbalance. First, identification of the direct targets of ENDU-2 is a critical step toward understanding how this endonuclease controls the activities of CTPS-1 and other downstream factors. Second, how CTPS-1 phosphorylation affects its enzymatic activity and how CTPS-1 activity in the intestine ultimately affects germline development remain attractive problems to tackle. Finally, how ENDU-2 expression and activity in the intestine is altered by changes in NT levels is potentially a critical question to investigate toward understanding the initial NT \u201csensing\u201d mechanism.",

As mentioned above, there are 2 isoforms of CTPS in humans, CTPS1 and CTPS2, and both isoforms are regulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, CTPS1 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and CTPS2 by casein kinase 1, in which both phosphorylation events inhibit enzyme activity (Higgins et al., 2007; Kassel et al., 2010). There is evidence that PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) may also phosphorylate CTPS1, but the results are contradictory and the site of action of PKA is unknown (Chang et al., 2007; Han et al., 2005; Higgins et al., 2007). Our data indicate that C. elegans CTPS-1 undergoes PKA-mediated phosphorylation that inhibits the enzyme activity, suggesting that this regulation by PKA is likely conserved between worms and humans, although the predicted phosphorylation site S532 is not conserved in human CTPS genes.",

Studying the mechanism of the impact of NTs on germline proliferation may thus provide insight into the drug-resistance mechanism in cancer cells. Human EndoU is a tumor marker, as the protein expression is below the detection level outside the placenta but is present in several tumor tissues (Laneve et al., 2008). Consistent with its potential function in carcinogenesis, we show that C. elegans endu-2 is responsive to genotoxic stress and is important for successful mitosis in the intestine. At least some of the functions are likely conserved in humans, as we have shown that human EndoU is also induced by HU treatment, and knocking down EndoU rendered HeLa cells hypersensitive to 5-FU and FUDR, both of which are widely used chemotherapy drugs. It is important to note that EndoU RNAi alone does not affect cell viability, and a mouse strain containing a homozygous EndoU deletion is viable (Dickinson et al., 2016). EndoU is a potential target with low toxicity and known lead drugs to enhance the efficiency of chemotherapy drugs 5-FU and FUDR. A previous screen has already identified small molecules that inhibit EndoU activity in the micromolar range (Ragno et al., 2011).",
