Under such a general definition, human mobility is multi-modal and happens in colossal volumes. We give here a very brief and partial review of mobility, focusing on its link with the spread of infectious pathogens of humans. We present a modelling technique, metapopulations, that can be used when considering such issues. The presentation builds on previous work of the author and collaborators, in particular Arino (2009). Note that we assume here that the reader is familiar with the basic steps involved in the study of a model in mathematical epidemiology.",

A simple arbitrary classification follows. Long-term mobility involves durations longer than six months and typically concerns relocation (immigration, move) or long term displacement from the place of residence (refugees). Six months is chosen as a cut point because public health authorities typically require that individuals affiliate with them if they spend this amount of time in their midst. Medium-term mobility involves events lasting from 1 to 6 months, typically related to domestic and foreign migrant workers, with individuals often maintaining two places of residence. Short-term mobility ranges from over 1 day to 1 month and corresponds to travel away from and back to the place of residence for work or leisure. Finally, instantaneous mobility involves events lasting no more than one day. These events can be daily commute but also work-related travel.",

Ranges vary from metres (local) to thousands of kilometres (intercontinental). Human mobility has evolved greatly over the course of human history. For many years, long range mobility was mainly linked to trade. Most humans were mobile only very locally (within a village or to neighbouring villages). It is only since the beginning of the 20th century that travel for leisure has become more prevalent and that as a consequence, more and more humans undertake short-duration long-range trips.",

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) defines a migrant as a person living in a country that is not their country of birth and under this definition, estimates that there are more than 200 million migrants around the world today, with 60% of these migrants living in developed countries. For instance, from 1980 to 2015, there were 7.4 million new Permanent Residents to Canada, out of an estimated total population in 2015 of 35.8 millions (Government of Canada, 2015). There is also a sizeable migration from rich countries; e.g., the French population registered at a foreign embassy was 1.7 million on December 31st, 2015 (Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et du D\u00e9veloppement international, 2016). Finally, refugees constitute an important factor of international migration, particularly relevant in the context of public health as they represent populations often in precarious health conditions. UNHCR estimates there were 15 million refugees (mid-2015), 1.2 million asylum-seekers (end 2014), 38 million internally displaced persons (end 2014) and 10 million stateless persons.",

Then the following hold true:1.\u2212Mc\nis a singular M-matrix.2.\u03c4(Mc)=0.3.\u03c4(Mc)\u2208\u03c3(Mc).4.One of the left eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue\n\u03c4(Ms)=0\nis the vector\n1|P|T=(1,\u2026,1).5.If additionally, Mc\nis irreducible, then\n\u03c4(Mc)=0\nhas multiplicity 1, 1|P|T\nis (to a multiple) the only strongly positive left eigenvector associated with\nMc\nand there is a strongly positive eigenvector\nv*\ncorresponding to\n\u03c4(Mc).6.Let\nD>0\nbe a diagonal matrix.

Points 1\u20135 are shown for example in Arino and Portet (2015). To prove 6, first consider the case D\u226b0. Define d\u00af=minp\u2208P{dpp}>0. Then \u2212Mc\u2264d\u00afI\u2212Mc\u2264D\u2212Mc. From Fiedler (2008, Theorem 5.2.5), d\u00afI\u2212Mc is an M-matrix. Since \u03c4(Mc)=0, using a \u201cspectrum shift\u201d (Horn & Johnson, 2013, Problem 1.2.P8), all eigenvalues of d\u00afI\u2212Mc have real parts larger than d\u00af, so d\u00af\u2212Mc is a nonsingular M-matrix. In turn, Fiedler (2008, Theorem 5.1.1.4) implies that D\u2212Mc is a nonsingular M-matrix and Fiedler (2008, Theorem 5.1.1.11) allows to conclude. Suppose now that Mc is irreducible. Let d\u00af=maxp\u2208P{dpp}>0. Then D\u2212Mc is irreducibly diagonally dominant with all columns k\u2208P such that dkk=d\u00af satisfying the strict diagonal dominance requirement. As a consequence, Varga (2004, Theorem 1.11) implies that D\u2212Mc is nonsingular and inverse positivity follows from Fiedler (2008), Theorem 5.2.10).",

Think of (13) as representing any model for a single population found in the literature. Within a given patch p, suppose some dynamical properties are known about (13). Which of these properties also hold for the general system with mobility (3)? It is relatively easy to show that such things as existence and boundedness of solutions is preserved. As shown in this article, the same is true to some extent of existence and local asymptotic stability of the DFE. As we have just seen, global asymptotic stability is not as easy to settle.

Consider a metapopulation such as (3) in which, when there is no movement, i.e., in the case of (13), some patches are at the DFE while others are at an EEP.
