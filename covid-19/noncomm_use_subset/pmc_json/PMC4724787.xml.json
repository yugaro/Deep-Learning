The sites, located in four provinces (Ratchaburi, Sakaeo, Nakorn Sawan, and Phitsanulok), were selected to represent several different ways in which bat guano mining is organized and regulated. Observing the different ways guano mining is handled was intended to capture possible variations in the age groups and numbers of people who are exposed to bats and bat excreta, the extent of their exposure, and the measures that are taken to reduce exposure. Preference was given to sites where other USAID EPT Program activities were taking place, especially other studies bat-borne and other zoonotic viruses. A map of the selected provinces is shown in Fig. 1.",

The selection of the miners was purported to capture the range of different ages, gender, and other characteristics noted by the mine managers. The eligible miners were required to have been engaged in the guano-mining work for a minimum of 6 months. The researchers approached the miners at the cave where they worked; obtained their preliminary consent, home addresses, and phone numbers; and made appointments to interview them at a convenient time at their homes or another location of their choice.Adults who dry, package, and/or purchase the guano at the mine site.

Since the arrival of the governmental wildlife conservation office, however, this practice has all but stopped. The Royal Forest Department prohibits trapping bats for consumption and levies a fine of 500 Baht on those who trap or eat bats. As in the other provinces, bats are sometimes trapped, and eaten or sold secretly. The bats that are eaten in the community are the flying fox and lotus bats, which tend to be comparatively large, fatty bats. It was also noted that Lesser Dog-faced Fruit Bat (Khang Kao Na Ma) and the Shortridge's Rousette bat (Khang Kao Bua) were occasionally consumed in the community. Some of the illegally trapped bats are sold to restaurants for 4\u20135 Baht per bat. The restaurants sell bats as a gourmet item that is likely not found on the published restaurant menu. Bat blood is used as a health supplement in the province. Fresh bat blood mixed with alcohol is sometimes used to relieve back, leg, and waist pain or to nourish the body and prevent \u2018wasting disease\u2019. Bat blood can be purchased in the community for 5\u201310 Baht per bottle.",

The fines were noted in all of the communities we studied.
