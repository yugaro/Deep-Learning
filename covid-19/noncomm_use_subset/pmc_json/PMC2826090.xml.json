The disease has been known for five centuries and its causative agent, the FMD virus (FMDV), belongs to the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae [1]. The FMDV genome is composed of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of about 8500 nucleotides that contains a unique open reading frame. Like other RNA viruses, FMDV is antigenically variable and undergoes rapid mutation. There are seven distinguishable serological types of FMDV, namely O, A, C, Asia I, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3. Current FMD vaccines based on inactivated virus are effective in preventing the disease, but carry the risks of incomplete inactivation and viral escape from vaccine production laboratories [26], and they fail to induce an immune response in a short period. Thus, the development of emergency antiviral strategies is necessary in order to stem outbreaks of FMD.",

            "text": "As an antiviral technology, RNAi has already been widely researched for use with FMDV [5, 24, 33]. However, establishing RNAi as a viable approach to prevent FMDV requires resolving at least one major issue [17, 20]: the high genetic variability of FMD viruses. RNAi directed toward specific gene sequences of certain FMDV strains may face risks, especially in the event of an emergent FMD outbreak, because no information about the serotype or genotype of the isolated pathogen would be available while early protection is needed. Therefore, it may be necessary to design several siRNA that focus on the conserved regions of the viral genome [16, 17, 42, 46]. Previously, we showed that siRNA generated in vitro can effectively inhibit the replication of FMDV in either a specific or cross-inhibitory manner [28]. Another crucial issue that needs to be addressed is the optimal vector for delivery of siRNA-expressing cassettes. Chen et al. [6] demonstrated that treatment with recombinant, replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 expressing short-hairpin RNA significantly reduces the susceptibility of guinea pigs and swine to FMDV infection. However, adenovirus VA1 non-coding RNA is able to inhibit the biogenesis of siRNA and microRNA [30]. This finding suggests that novel siRNA delivery systems would be necessary.",

Live-attenuated Salmonella has been shown to deliver DNA vaccines [9, 35, 41, 47]. Early in the 1970s, Fang et al. screened out an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis C500, which was a licensed live vaccine against swine paratyphoid [13].

The traditional emergency vaccines based on virus inactivation could be effective in preventing disease within 4 to 5 days post-vaccination, due to a critical role for innate immune defenses [2, 39]. However, signs of disease can appear as early as 2 days post-exposure. Thus, it is necessary to develop antiviral strategies capable of inducing early protection in the face of an outbreak that threatens to spread widely. Recently, we and several other groups demonstrated that RNAi can be potentially used as a therapeutic or prophylactic mechanism against FMDV [6, 24, 33]. However, to be effective against RNA viruses such as FMDV, which are highly antigenically variable, the siRNA must be targeted to conserved regions.

First, it is well known that different siRNA have different efficiencies in inducing RNAi [21\u201323]. Second, the proteins encoded by these genes have essential functions in different phases of the viral replication cycle. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D) is a key enzyme in viral RNA replication [34, 44]; VP4 is a structural protein, located inside the mature virus particle, and is involved in conversion of provirions to mature virions [1]; and 2B is involved in membrane rearrangements required for viral RNA replication and capsid assembly [19]. Third, we compared 14 reported FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I. The analysis showed that the sequences in these regions are relatively conserved between different FMDV serotypes. Previously, De los Santos et al. [11] found that an siRNA directed against a conserved sequence within the coding region of viral NS protein 2B of FMDV was capable of inhibiting virus replication in infected porcine cells by approximately 97\u201398%. And this 2B-specific siRNA reduced virus yield in cells infected with 4 different FMDV serotypes. Liu et al. [28] demonstrated that siRNA directed to the conserved regions of the FMDV genome, namely VP4 and 3D, could inhibit the replication of both FMDV strains, serotype O and Asia I. Our study indicates that p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 dramatically inhibited viral replication in cultured cells that were susceptible to FMDV of either serotype O or serotype Asia I. Suckling mice treated with the siRNA-expressing plasmids had significantly reduced susceptibility to both serotype O and serotype Asia I of FMDV.",

            "text": "Efficient delivery of siRNA into cells or organs in vivo remains a major bottleneck in antiviral therapy. A number of methods for delivering siRNA in vivo have been tested [3, 15, 27, 49]. Liposome formulations are generally used [3, 15, 49], but a simple intranasal administration of naked siRNA has been shown to be effective against respiratory viruses [3]. Chen et al. [6] used adenoviruses as the vectors for the delivery of duplex RNA to the target tissue, and total RNA were extracted from five tissues (oropharynx, lung, liver, muscle, and epidermis of the foot) of guinea pigs treated with rAd5 and assayed for rAd5 GFP mRNA. The vast majority of rAd5 was found in the liver. In cloven-hoofed animals, the oropharynx has been identified as the major site of FMDV replication during acute and persistent infection [37]. Brown et al. [4] indicated that the FMDV RNA was localized in the tonsil, pharynx and the tracheo-bronchial lymph node. The different tissue distribution of rAd5 and FMDV is probably related to antiviral activity of rAd5 in vivo. Our overall goal was to find a siRNA vector that can spread through the similar infection and transmission tract as FMDV. Attenuated Salmonella has become popular for expressing foreign antigens as a vaccine strain or as a delivery vector of DNA vaccines [10, 12]. Gray et al. [18] found that S. choleraesuis was most often recovered from the lymph node, tonsil, lung and alimentary tract of swine inoculated with S. choleraesuis. These studies aroused our interest in evaluating the potential of Salmonella as a vector for siRNA delivery. We found that 80% of guinea pigs were completely protected when inoculated with 109 CFU of p3D-NT56/rS. cho, and that rS. cho also conferred marked antiviral activity in swine. Surprisingly, the antiviral potential of RNAi was evidently impaired in animals treated with a high dose of rS. cho. Srinivasan et al. [43] demonstrated that variation in the initial dose of infection with Salmonella had a profound effect on the response of Salmonella flagellin-specific CD4 T cells in vivo, and that low-dose infection could evade Salmonella flagellin-specific T cell activation completely. Mercado et al. [32] reported that a 25-fold dilution in bacterial challenge dose did not significantly alter the size or kinetics of the Listeria LLO91\u201399-specific CD8 T cell response. The low-dose effect may represent a general mechanism to increase virulence. The immune evasion could probably make the lower dose salmonella more efficient as a vector to carry siRNA.",
