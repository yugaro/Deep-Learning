However, there have been no further published EriCoV whole genome sequencing attempts, and many questions remain over the origins and evolution of EriCoV [2]. Whilst there is no known threat to public health from EriCoV, further investigation of the virus is warranted to gain a fuller understanding of the impact of coronavirus infection on wildlife populations.",

Both bats and camels have been cited as possible reservoirs of MERS-CoV [6, 11]. It is considered that bats are the likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV [2, 5], and that dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius), and potentially other species, act as an intermediate host for human transmission [6, 12, 13]. MERS-CoV-like virus sequences have only been detected in one other species, E. europaeus [3]. Hedgehogs are members of the order Eulipotyphla, which is closely related to Chiroptera, the order of bats [14]. This close association is what initially led to hedgehogs being investigated as a potential coronavirus reservoir [3].",

The reasons for this decline are not fully understood, and it is likely to be multi-factorial (e.g. habitat loss and fragmentation, road traffic death and predation) [21, 22].

A total of nine wildlife centres across GB collected and supplied samples, using the methods described by Sangster et al. [23]. A fresh faecal sample was collected non-invasively shortly after admission and associated metadata, including clinical signs, signalment, location and history, were collected where available. Faecal samples were stored at 4 or \u221220 \u00b0C for a maximum of 1 week at rehabilitation centres prior to submission. A subsample of each sample collected by Sangster et al. [23] was used in the current study. An additional four voided faecal samples were collected from the wild as part of a Greater London-based hedgehog population survey conducted in 2014 to give a total of 229 faecal samples from live animals.",

This concurs with studies reporting natural CoV infections in wild animal species, including bats [15] and aquatic birds [16], which do not manifest as clinical disease. This is also a common feature of a reservoir or maintenance host [28, 29]. Coronavirus infections of man and other animals are known to predispose to secondary infections, for example, a study recently isolated feline coronavirus and several other enteropathogens from cats with diarrhoea [30], thus making any association difficult to detect should it occur with EriCoV infection in the hedgehog. In the current study, histopathological examination was complicated by concurrent parasitic and bacterial infections in several cases and limited by freeze\u2013thaw artefact and the state of tissue preservation, therefore microscopic lesions caused by viral infection could have been missed or obscured. Experimental infection studies and the development of in situ hybridisation to localise EriCoV in tissues would be worthwhile in the future to further elucidate the clinical significance of EriCoV infection.",

Many of the hedgehogs reported to have green faeces also had faeces of another colour, suggesting that faecal colour change is not unusual. The colour change or the reporting thereof may not be consistent and therefore this result should be interpreted with caution.

The proportion of hedgehogs sampled in 2015 that tested positive for EriCoV was higher than that in 2014; a difference that was consistent irrespective of sample type or hedgehog age class (Table 2). This temporal variability in detection rate is consistent with previous multi-year studies in bats where significant annual variation in coronavirus detection rate was reported [34]. Seasonal variation in contact rates, environmental factors and fluctuating levels of CoV immunity in the population have all been postulated as causes for such fluctuations [34]. Proving viral persistence and establishing critical community size is challenging for wildlife populations [29]. Whilst there is now a wealth of studies investigating bat CoVs, research is lacking for other wildlife CoVs. There is evidence that the gregarious roosting habits of some species of bat facilitate CoV transmission [35], but the transmission dynamics of EriCoV in the more-solitary hedgehog [20] are likely to be very different. Establishing whether infection is endemic in British hedgehogs will require longitudinal sampling, augmented by age-specific serology [36].",

This difference could be due to assay sensitivity or sample degradation. Although the limit of detection of the previously used assays was not given, average copy numbers in the faecal samples were well over the sensitivity threshold of the assay used here. All three studies included hedgehogs in wildlife centres. In the German study, no details were given for the timing of sampling. In the current and French studies, however, faecal samples were taken soon after admission (typically within 48 h) in order to reduce the possibility of nosocomial transmission. Dog kennels and shelters are recognised as important environments for maintaining enteric canine CoVs, with increased length of stay associated with increased probability of CoV infection [37]. However, nosocomial transmission seems to be an unlikely cause of the differences in sample percentage of positive samples in this study. Another potential factor is that the relatively high percentage of positive samples in the French and German studies could be simply due to a much higher prevalence of EriCoV in the mainland Europe hedgehog population: the recruited wildlife centres (from which the hedgehogs were sampled) were all located in North and North Western France, with one located close to the border with Germany [4]. More studies are required to determine this.",

Overall identity to the previous coronavirus detected in hedgehogs from mainland Europe was high (94%), but lower than the identity between two German EriCoV isolates (97%) [3]. Previous studies have demonstrated that EriCoV shares a common ancestor with MERS-CoV, and bat coronaviruses HKU5 and HKU4, raising the possibility of a lineage that has been positively selected for and which has evolved with the potential for cross-species transmission. Host tropism in the coronaviruses is largely determined by the spike protein and its ability to bind to host cell receptors. Both the German and the GB EriCoVs have <40% amino acid similarity with MERS-CoV at the crucial receptor-binding domain on the spike protein, suggesting that binding to the human receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) is unlikely. Virus culture was not attempted in this study, but was previously unsuccessful and this might be due to the cell tropism of the virus [3].",
