Alston noted the extraordinary progress that China has made over the past three decades in bringing people out of poverty. In particular, he reported that \u201c[i]n 2003, only 10% of the population had health insurance\u201d whereas \u201c[b]y 2013, some 95% were covered, including most of the rural poor and vulnerable urban groups.\u201d1 Additionally, between 2000 and 2012, the infant mortality rate fell by 60% and the maternal mortality rate fell by 49%, and between 1990 and 2012, life expectancy increased from 69 to 75 years. Alston, accordingly, concluded that there were lessons for other countries to be drawn from China\u2019s achievements. Significantly, he declared that \u201cgenuine political will to alleviate poverty is arguably the most important ingredient of all.\u201d2",

The absence of \u201ceffective options for seeking redress or letting steam off,\u201d he noted, often leads to violence both by and against petitioners and protesters.3 Accordingly, the development of effective domestic mechanisms of accountability in China is a crucial issue. In this context, this article provides an overview of accountability mechanisms in China, focusing on the right to health specifically and revealing where such mechanisms are lacking and how they might be improved. Accountability may involve a broad range of mechanisms\u2014such as litigation, elections, public hearings, town meetings, professional oversight, social actions, and media reports\u2014and China is a large and complex country. The article, therefore, does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review and does not examine any particular mechanism in depth. Nonetheless, the overview and analysis have implications for accountability for the right to health and all economic and social rights in China.",

For example, it requires that the state implement a non-discriminatory and effective health system; that it guarantee the availability and accessibility of clean water and essential medicines; and much more.7 Many state actors are involved in implementing these processes. In terms of the right to health, these actors constitute duty-bearers. Supervising and monitoring the actions of these actors in relation to their duties is essential. In this way, these duty-bearers can be held accountable if they fail to fulfill their respective obligations and responsibilities, or if they abuse their powers. Accountability is an important component in the realization of the right to health, and accountability mechanisms play crucial roles in the supervisory process required to enhance the realization of this right.8",

In so doing, it reviews current Chinese institutional mechanisms and considers the use of less formal mechanisms by which duty-bearers might be held accountable for the right to health. More specifically, the article discusses judicial accountability, political accountability, administrative accountability, professional accountability, and social accountability. In short, it explores whether the Western concept of accountability has the potential to improve the protection of the right to health within China. The article concludes that there is a domestic accountability framework\u2014although very different from that of Western democracies\u2014operating at various levels in China with some capacity to protect the right to health. Nonetheless, this accountability framework involves largely top-down processes and fails to provide adequate avenues for rights-holders to complain and to seek remedies for violations of their rights.9",

In relation to the right to health, three forms of political accountability are reflected in the Chinese political system. These include accountability of the National People\u2019s Congress, which concerns supervision of political power in the process of decision making; accountability of the State Council, which concerns the use of available resources and the equal allocation of resources for the right to health; and accountability within the Communist Party, which has a unique form with particular Chinese characteristics.",

As such, they are subject to an internal supervisory procedure that holds officials accountable in vertical administrative relationships. Additionally, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party is a quasi-governmental body whose main function is to root out corruption and malfeasance among members of the Communist Party.62 Thus, to some degree, accountability functions within the party. Health officials are considered for promotion based on their political and administrative performance. If health officials are proven to have failed in implementing their duties, besides being moved away from administrative positions, they may face dismissal from the Communist Party.63 This accountability mechanism functions downward only, however, and is not necessarily responsive to failures to realize right to health. Within the Communist Party, accountability essentially functions through a combination of both political and social accountability. Once social accountability is triggered by the public (see below), political accountability may follow and work effectively.",

It is also common for doctors to get rebates from pharmaceutical companies for prescribing their medicines to patients. Moreover, hospitals share rebates from pharmaceutical companies with doctors.78 These incentives lead to the unnecessary overprescribing of medicines, which wastes medical resources and is harmful to the health of patients. Whether a prescription or treatment is suitable or necessary, however, is difficult for individual patients to assess. It is also difficult for individuals with no professional knowledge to provide sufficient evidence to hold health care providers accountable.

Nonetheless, it is partially justiciable through other health-related rights that are directly justiciable. Political accountability in China has traditionally been performed through the National People\u2019s Congress, through the reporting of the State Council, and through supervision mechanisms within the Communist Party. Although there is an identifiable framework of political accountability, lack of public participation has rendered it a very weak mechanism by which to hold the government to account. It has therefore recently come to be practiced in combination with a new process of public censure through the media. Additionally, in recent years, the government has started to explore other means of public participation, such as a 2008 pilot of an online feedback system that invited individuals to comment on ongoing health care reforms.81",
