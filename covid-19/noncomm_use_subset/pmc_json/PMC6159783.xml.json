It is characterized by aggressive behavior, onset at young age, and early relapse.3,4 TNBC is insensitive to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy, and therefore, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Although some clinical trials found that TNBC is more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy,5,6 taxane/anthracycline-based regimens are still standard and preferred regimens for TNBC patients in the adjuvant setting.7 However, not all TNBC patients respond to chemotherapy, which suggests that TNBC is more than a single disease.8 Identifying biomarkers to further subdivide TNBC patients with distinct outcome is of great importance.",

Taxanes are microtubule targeting agents (MTAs), which are most widely used drugs in adjuvant setting for TNBC patients. The cytotoxic action of these compounds is mediated primarily through their binding of \u03b2-tubulin monomers, leading to microtubule stabilization, thus blocking their depolymerization and subsequently triggering cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase.31 Considering the role of Aurora kinases in spindle formation and the reported extent of their deregulation in cancer, we hypothesize that polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB might contribute to taxane resistance and then influence the survival of cancer patients. Zhang et al30 demonstrated that in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing sequential taxane and anthracycline-based regimens), elevated expression of AURKB contributed to chemoresistance (P = 0.011). In taxane-resistance breast cancer cell lines, expression of AURKA was significantly higher. Knockdown of AURKA not only markedly decreased the expression of P-gp but also downregulated the P-gp function in resistant breast cancer cells. The results indicated that AURKA plays a crucial role in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer.32",

In the case of AURKB rs2289590, when the A allele was present, PEA3 and TFII-I binding motifs were recognized. In contrast, when the C allele is present, PEA3, TFII-I, and YY1 binding motifs were identified. Since YY1 expression level and/or activity is associated with unchecked cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, metastasis, and tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutics,34 the binding of an additional YY1 protein in the presence of C allele may alter the level of AURKB expression and then influence the survival, which might be a possible explanation for our result that AURKB rs2289590 A allele was significantly associated with better DFS.",
