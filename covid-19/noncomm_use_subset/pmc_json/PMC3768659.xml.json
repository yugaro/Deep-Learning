BCoV is a member of the group 2 of the genus Coronavirus (Nidovirales: Coronaviridae) (5, 7), with a genome formed by a single-stranded non-segmented positive-sense RNA with 32 kb, arranged in a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry in association with the N nucleoprotein, a conserved phosphoprotein with 50-60kDa rich in basic amino acids (7, 9). The viral envelope of BCoV is formed by a lipid bi-layer with four structural proteins (HE, S, E and M), resulting in a spiked structure (9).",
