An ophthalmologist reviewed the medical records of all referred patients and wrote down a final principal diagnosis for each admitted patient. A maximum of two diagnoses was allowed if a single principal diagnosis could not be determined. Patients referred for a suspected ocular disease but who were later found to not have the disease were diagnosis as \u201chealthcare\u201d. Otherwise, based on the final diagnosis, the referred cases were classified into \u201ccornea, retina, uveitis, glaucoma, strabismus, pediatric, neuro (ophthalmology), or oculoplasty\u201d. Cases without an ophthalmologic diagnosis were described as \u201cothers\u201d. The purpose of treatment and medical expenses were recorded to assess disease severity. Patients determined to need treatment were categorized as requiring surgical treatment, requiring hospitalization, or requiring outpatient treatment with short-interval follow-ups (within 4 to 5 days). We examined the medical expenses for ophthalmology-related outpatient treatment or hospitalization for six months after the initial hospital visit. When receiving treatment at the ophthalmology department, special doctor fees were excluded from the total expenses to rule out fee differences according to specialists. We created two types of classification systems for referral hospitals in the healthcare delivery system. First, hospitals were classified into primary-care clinics, hospitals (or general hospitals), or tertiary referral hospitals based on the number of beds. Second, hospitals were divided by functional capability in terms of doctors' medical specialty into non-eye specialists, eye specialists, and eye specialists in trainee hospital.",

Currently, medical laws in Korea require that hospitals be classified according to their number of beds. This classification system may be easy to use but it is not a practical way to organize a healthcare delivery system for a country where approximately 90% of the physicians are specialists [7], because the bed-number classification system does not apply to specialties, such as ophthalmology. For this reason, we investigated the shortcomings of the current referral system by analyzing patients who were referred to ophthalmology departments of higher-level hospitals and our findings suggest a need for a new complementary healthcare delivery system.",

Therefore, eye specialists in trainee hospital are considered as more professional than eye specialist in non-trainee hospital. When we categorized referral hospitals by their specialty function, we found that patients being referred to the eye specialists in trainee hospital tended to have more severe disease. On the other hand, 81.8% of all patients referred from non-eye specialists did not require treatment, and 93.4% of the patients under the age of 20 in this group did not require any treatments as well. Many patients could not be diagnosed because most visited the hospitals for a health examination despite being well; thus, herein, such cases are classified as \u201chealthcare\u201d. The problems of the current healthcare delivery system appear to arise from non-ophthalmologic practitioners, such as pediatricians or family physicians, who too easily give referral letters for tertiary hospitals to patients complaining of ophthalmologic discomfort [678].",

            "text": "The outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the summer of 2015 in Korea offered an opportunity to draw attention to the problems of the national healthcare delivery system. Since then, a large number of studies have explored MERS prevention strategies [910]. Cho [9] proposed that specialization of medical institutions and reinforcement of referral guidelines are essential to ease overcrowding in tertiary hospitals, which was a main cause of the MERS outbreak. Cho's suggestions are consistent with our recommendation that classification by functional capability should be emphasized rather than classification by hospital type (clinic, hospital, and general hospital) where specialists in various medical specialties and general practitioners work together [9]. Easing overcrowding in tertiary hospitals corresponds to the reinforcement of primary care. Primary care reinforcement is one of the key strategies for efficient and equitable healthcare reform. Healthcare reform efforts in the United States also mainly seek to strengthen primary care through a program called the patient-centered medical home model [1112].",

This study shows that classifying hospitals based on their number of beds is inadequate for the health care delivery system to work properly in the Korean medical environment where there are more specialists than general practitioners.
