For production of rhabdoviral particles, a protocol described elsewhere [18] was followed. VLPs were produced by expression of HIV-1 Gag in combination with the GP of interest in 293T cells, followed by centrifugation of the VLP-containing supernatant through a 20% sucrose cushion [30]. The presence of Gag and GP in VLP preparations was analyzed by Western blot, using antibodies against HIV-p24 (NIH) and monoclonal antibody 3B11 directed against EBOV-GP [31].",

Transduction efficiency was determined by quantification of luciferase activities in cell lysates at 30 hours (rhabdoviral pseudotypes) or 72 hours after transduction (retroviral pseudotypes), using commercially available kits (Promega, PJK). In some experiments, target cells were transduced to express interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins or were transfected to express cellular lectins, as described previously [18], before transduction with GP-bearing pseudotypes. Alternatively, expression of EBOV entry factors was inhibited by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). For this, siRNA knock down in target cells was performed 24 hours prior to transduction by transfection of 5 pmol of siRNA (all Santa Cruz), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). To determine whether cationic amphiphiles (U18666A, Merck; clomiphene or terconazole, Sigma-Aldrich) or protease inhibitors (CatL inhibitor III, Merck; CA074Me, Calbiochem; CA074; Sigma-Aldrich; AEBSF, Roth) influence transduction efficiency, the inhibitors were diluted in appropriate solvent as recommended by the manufacturer. Target cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C before addition of pseudotypes, and the culture medium was replaced by fresh culture medium without inhibitor after 8 hours.",

In contrast, lymphocytes are refractory to infection, both in vitro and in vivo [32, 33]. To analyze whether previously and currently circulating EBOVs show differences in host cell tropism and entry, we comparatively analyzed pseudotypes bearing the GPs of EBOV, strain Mayinga, 1976 (EBOV-GP 1976) and EBOV variant Makona (EBOV-GP 2014) [34], which differ in 1 amino acid residue in the RBD and 16 amino acid residues in the MLD (Supplementary Figure 1). Pseudotypes bearing VSV-G served as positive control, while pseudotypes bearing no GP were used as negative control. Both EBOV GPs were efficiently expressed in transfected cells and incorporated into retroviral particles (Supplementary Figure 2), and both mediated entry into the human cell lines 293T, Huh7, U373, RPE, HOS, and EA-hy with comparable efficiencies (Figure 1A). Similarly, transduction of macrophages obtained upon PMA treatment of THP-1 cells was comparable (Figure 1A). In contrast, both GPs were unable to facilitate transduction of a human B-cell line (Raji), a human T-cell line (Jurkat and a human T/B hybrid cell line (CEMx174; Figure 1B).\n",

Transduction of the LLC-MK2 and sMAGI cell lines was comparable to transduction of the Vero cell line (Figure 1C). In contrast, EBOV-GP 1976 was more efficient than EBOV-GP 2014 at transducing COS7 cells. Finally, the ability of EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 to transduce bat cell lines (derived from Rousettus aegyptiacus and Hypsignathus monstrosus) was examined, since H. monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata can serve as natural reservoir for EBOVs [36].

We addressed whether EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 show differential dependence on these factors for host cell entry. The lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, ASGPR1, and LSECtin are known to augment GP-driven entry [12, 13, 37] and promoted transduction driven by EBOV-GP 1974 and EBOV-GP 2014 to similar extents while expression of CLEC5A, which binds Dengue virus [38], had no effect (Figure 2A). Moreover, both EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 used TIM-1 and Axl for entry into certain target cells (Figure 2B), while expression of NPC-1 was universally required for entry (Figure 2B and 2C). Finally, entry driven by both GPs was comparably inhibited by U18666A, which induces an NPC-1 knockout phenotype in cells [39], and related compounds (Figure 2C), in the absence of unwanted cytotoxic effects (not shown). Thus, our studies revealed no obvious difference in entry factor use by EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014.\n",

We used a panel of inhibitors previously employed to study EBOV-GP protease use [40], to determine whether EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 exhibit differences in their protease requirements. Entry driven by both proteins was comparably inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors CA074Me and CA074, which efficiently inhibit catB but have little or no effect on catL and catS activity [40]. In contrast, the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF had no effect on GP-driven entry, and none of the compounds tested modulated entry driven by VSV-G (Figure 3A), as expected [40]. These observations indicate that EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 both depend on catB activity for efficient transduction of 293T cells. However, EBOV-GP 2014 was less susceptible than EBOV-GP 1976 to blockade by a third inhibitor, CatL (Figure 3B), which inhibits catB and catL activity to similar extents [40], suggesting subtle differences in the protease dependence of these GPs.\n",

Our results suggest that this is not the case: entry mediated by EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 was dependent on expression of the cholesterol transporter NPC-1 and was inhibited by compounds that induce accumulation of endosomal cholesterol. Moreover, expression of endogenous TIM-1 and Axl, which can augment GP-driven entry by binding directly (TIM-1) or via a bridging molecule (Axl) to PtdSer in the viral envelope [45, 46], promoted entry driven by both EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014. The MLD of GP is heavily modified with O-linked glycans and is required for binding to certain host cell lectins [47]. The observation that the MLD of EBOV-GP 2014 contains 16 amino acid substitutions relative to the MLD of EBOV-GP 1976 suggested that engagement of cellular lectins might differ between these GPs. However, again no appreciable differences were observed. In keeping with the comparable entry factor use, both GPs facilitated entry into an identical spectrum of cell lines derived from bats, NHPs, and humans, including THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. The only consistent difference observed was a reduction of EBOV-GP 2014\u2013mediated transduction of COS7 cells, relative to that mediated by EBOV-GP 1976. This effect might point toward subtle differences in entry factor use, which may not be detectable in the assay system used in the present study.",

Several studies indicate that vectors bearing EBOV-GP, as well as authentic EBOV, depend on the activity of catB/L for infectious entry into cell lines [14, 48, 49], although catB/L dependence seems to vary between Ebolavirus species [48, 50], and the activity of these particular proteases is dispensable for EBOV spread in a murine model [48]. The present study suggests that catB/L dependence extends to viruses currently circulating in West Africa. However, reduced susceptibility of EBOV-GP 2014 to the inhibitor CatL, relative to that of EBOV-GP 1976, points toward minor differences in the protease requirements of the respective GPs.",

The cleavage products, the surface unit GP1 and the transmembrane unit GP2, remain covalently associated via a disulphide bond. One could speculate that the stability of this association might be different between EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014, which could translate into different stability of retroviral particles bearing these GPs. However, a comparable time- and temperature-dependent loss of infectivity of EBOV-GP 1976\u2013bearing and EBOV-GP 2014\u2013bearing particles was observed, arguing against substantial differences in GP stability, although it cannot be disregarded that GP stability might differ in the context of retroviral and filoviral particles.",

The present study suggests that EBOV variants from 1976 and 2014 are susceptible to both defense mechanisms. Expression of IFITM proteins comparably inhibited host cell entry driven by EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014, potentially by increasing endosomal cholesterol levels [17, 18]. Moreover, entry driven by both GPs was blocked by neutralizing antibody KZ52, which was obtained from a human EVD survivor and targets GP2 [44]. Collectively, these results and the observations discussed above suggest that previously and presently circulating EBOV variants might use similar mechanisms for host cell entry, infect a similar spectrum of target cells, and might be comparably susceptible to inhibition by innate and adaptive immune responses.",
