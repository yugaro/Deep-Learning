In the United States alone, honeybee pollination is valued at $14.6 billion annually (1). However, over the past several decades, there has been much concern throughout the world over the steep decline in populations of honeybees (2). Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a mysterious malady that abruptly wiped out entire hives of honeybees across the United States, was first reported in 2006 (3, 4) and has since spread around the world (5), exacerbating the already dire situation for honeybees. RNA viruses, alone or in conjunction with other pathogens, have frequently been implicated in colony losses (3, 6, 7).",

A study conducted by Singh et al. (11) reported that deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), which are common in A. mellifera, were detected in eleven species of native bees and wasps as well as in pollen pellets collected directly from healthy foraging bees. Furthermore, the study by Singh et al. (11) showed that viruses in the pollen were infective, as illustrated by the fact that queens became infected and laid infected eggs after virus-negative colonies consumed virus-contaminated foods. This discovery raised concerns about a possible role of pollen in spreading viruses and suggested that viruses could possibly contribute to the observed pollinator decline around the world. In order to advance our understanding of the role of pollen in virus transmission of honeybees, we carried out a study to screen bees and pollen loads of bee colonies for the presence of frequent and rare viruses. Our study resulted in the serendipitous detection of a plant virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), in honeybees and prompted us to investigate whether this plant-infecting virus could cause systemic infection in exposed honeybees.",

            "text": "Generally, the majority of plant viruses are dependent upon herbivorous insects for their spread from one host plant to another in nature but cause infection only in plants that the insect vectors feed upon. To date, only a few plant viruses are known that also infect their insect vectors. Rhabdoviridae, a family of arboviruses carried by arthropods, has long been recognized to have a broad range of hosts throughout the animal and plant kingdoms (12). Flock house virus (FHV), a positive-stranded RNA virus of insect origin belonging to the family Nodaviridae, has been shown to replicate in plants as well as in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammalian cells (13, 14). A recent study (15) showed that a plant-pathogenic virus, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), which is a member of the family Bunyaviridae, could directly alter the behavior of thrips that vector it. The phenomenon of viral host range spanning the plant and animal kingdoms adds an additional layer to the already complex plant-pathogen-pollinator interactions and could have important epidemiological consequences.",

            "text": "TRSV is a type species of the genus Nepovirus within the family Secoviridae (16). TRSV infects a wide range of herbaceous crops and woody plants, some of considerable economic importance. The infected plants show discoloration, malformation, and stunted growth, accompanied by reduced seed yield or almost total seed loss due to flower and pod abortion. Of a number of plant diseases caused by TRSV, bud blight disease of soybean (Glycine max L.) is the most severe. It is characterized by necrotic ring spots on the foliage, curving of the terminal bud, and rapid wilting and eventual death of the entire plant, resulting in a yield loss of 25 to 100% (17). Like other members of the genus, TRSV has a bipartite genome of positive-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecules, RNA-1 and RNA-2, which are encapsidated in separate virions of similar size. Both RNA molecules possess a genome-linked protein (Vpg) covalently bound at their 5\u2032 ends. RNA-1 encodes a large polyprotein precursor that is proteolytically processed into protease cofactor (P1A), putative ATP-dependent helicase (Hel), picornain 3C-like protease (Pro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Pol). RNA2 encodes a virion capsid protein (CP), a putative movement protein (MP), and an N-terminal domain involved in RNA-2 replication (P2A). Proteins encoded by RNA-1 are required for RNA replication, while proteins encoded by RNA-2 function in cell-to-cell movement and viral RNA encapsulation. RNA-1 is capable of replication independently of RNA-2, but both are required for systemic infection. Transmission of TRSV can occur in several ways. The numerous vectors include a dagger nematode (18), aphids, thrips, grasshoppers, and tobacco flea beetle (19\u201321); however, vertical transmission through seeds is important for long-distance dispersal of the virus (22). It has also been shown that honeybees transmit TRSV when they move between flowers and transfer virus-borne pollen from infected plants to healthy ones (23\u201326). It was, however, unknown prior to our study whether honeybees could become infected by plant viruses they physically encounter or consume.",

TRSV in honeybees does not fit a circulative-propagative model of insect-vectored plant viruses, in which virions are ingested by an insect vector, replicate, and disperse to salivary glands for reinfection of the plant host. Instead, our data indicate that the replication of TRSV occurs widely in the honeybee body but not in the gut or salivary gland and that TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses is correlated with winter colony level declines. Further, virus was found in a common ectoparasite mite of honeybees, Varroa destructor, but was restricted to the gastric cecum. This study presents a unique example of viruses that cause infection in both plants and animals.",

By assembling sequence fragments from different cDNA clones, we obtained a 1,545-bp length of nucleotide sequences encoding the RNA helicase and covering ~21% of the coding region of the polyprotein gene of genomic RNA-1. We also obtained a 2,024-bp long sequence encoding the complete capsid protein.

A BLAST search of the DNA fragment encoding the capsid protein showed strongest similarity to a TRSV strain from bean (GenBank accession no.

Amplification and sequence analysis of a 462-bp negative-strand-specific product in different tissues showed that active replication of TRSV occurs in most tissues (Fig. 4). A single peak on the melting curve analysis corroborated the specificity of the amplicon. The lack of amplification following RT-qPCR of total RNA without primers in the reverse transcription reaction mixture ruled out any nonspecific effect from self priming due to the secondary structure of viral RNA or false priming by anti-genomic viral RNA or cellular RNAs. Among tissues with detectable levels, the relative abundance of negative-stranded TRSV varied significantly (P < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The brain had the lowest detectable level of negative-stranded TRSV and was chosen as the calibrator. The abundance of TRSV in other tissues relative to the brain ranged from 56-fold to 957-fold. The concentration of TRSV in additional body tissues showed the following ranking: muscle > hypopharyngeal gland > leg > fat body > trachea > hemolymph > antenna > nerve > wing.

However, this study represents the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen could also be subsequently infected and that the infection could be systemic and spread throughout the entire body of honeybees. About 5% of known plant viruses are pollen transmitted, and the genomes of the majority of plant viruses are made of RNA (37, 38), providing a large set of potential host-jumping viruses.

First, it must have the opportunity to come into contact with a prospective host for the viral particles to gain entry into the host cells. Second, the virus must undergo genetic changes that mediate the entry of virus into host cells, typically through host receptors on the cell surface. The virus must also undergo genetic changes that can lead to the ability to bypass the host\u2019s immune defense and replicate its genome using the host\u2019s cellular machinery. Finally, the virus must gain the ability to spread horizontally between individuals of the same generation within new host populations. The detection of replicate intermediates of TRSV in different tissues of honeybees and the prevalence of TRSV in bee populations provide strong evidence that TRSV has overcome these key hurdles. The presence of a TRSV-positive signal in parasitic Varroa mites suggests that Varroa could serve as a vector to facilitate the horizontal transmission of TRSV between bees in the colonies.",

Infections of several honeybee viruses occur through ingestion of virus-contaminated food followed by dissemination of the viruses from the midgut into other tissues through the hemolymph (39). Since TRSV is a known pollen-borne plant virus, we initially believed that the presence of TRSV was restricted to the bees\u2019 digestive tract. However, titers of TRSV in our study were unexpectedly low in the gut. Viral replication was not detected in either the gut or the salivary gland. Instead, high titers of negative-stranded virus were found in the wing, nerve, antenna, trachea, hemolymph, and fat body, indicating replication in those tissues. The absence of virus replication in the tissues of the gut and salivary gland excludes the possibility of TRSV as a persistent-propagative virus which must first replicate in epithelial cells of the midgut and then migrate to the salivary glands to be ejected together with saliva. Our quantitative analysis suggests that TRSV is neurotropic in honeybees, with more extensive infection detected in the nervous system than in other internal tissues, and therefore it is conceivable that severe TRSV infection can cause functional impairment of the nerve and muscle in honeybees. The low levels of TRSV in the gut suggests a possible result of sloughing off of infected epithelial cells from midgut as a host defensive mechanism or the possibility that TRSV might utilize some alternative invasion routes such as the neural or tracheal route. Further investigation of the virus transmission and pathogenicity is warranted.",

Indeed, the roles played by Varroa mites in acquiring and transmitting honeybee viruses have been experimentally demonstrated in several studies (46\u201349). The observation of the positive signal of TRSV within the storage organ of the mites suggests that the Varroa mite is not merely a mechanical vector that physically transports viruses from host to host with its mouthparts. More work is needed to confirm whether Varroa mites can act as a biological vector to support TRSV replication.",

It is likely that Varroa mites obtained the virus from their hosts during the blood feeding and that the virus-infected bees contaminated the bee pollen when they mix plant pollen with their glandular secretions and honey to produce \u201cbee bread.\u201d The finding that TRSV isolates from honeybees appeared to be derived more recently on the evolutionary timeline than TRSV from plants suggests that life cycles of the virus involving arthropod hosts evolved after host expansion. However, it remains to be determined whether TRSV possesses the ability to maintain persistent infection in honeybee colonies in the absence of newly inoculated viruses from visited plants or whether infected bees can subsequently inoculate healthy plants. It will similarly be helpful to screen other pollinator species for the presence of TRSV, since it is known that honeybees and other pollinators share some viral species (8\u201311, 50).",

The relatively high level of sequence similarity at the amino acid level for both capsid protein and helicase indicates a high level of structural and functional conservation. Nevertheless, substitution of a single or a few amino acids at the surface of virus particles can be sufficient to alter receptor recognition and thereby alter host range (51). Thus, the few amino acid polymorphisms observed in TRSV strains infecting honeybees may still be associated with cell tropism and host adaptation. It would be helpful to further characterize the complete genome of TRSV isolates from honeybees as well as from Varroa mites to deepen our understanding of genetic diversity of this virus. More work is needed to elucidate the molecular basis of cell tropism and host range modifications and to investigate the roles of the honeybee as a newly identified host in the epidemiology of TRSV.",

While findings from this study have important implications for understanding TRSV transmission and pathogenesis, much remains to be learned about the intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts. Although the cause(s) of CCD and the decline in the worldwide bee population is not yet fully understood (52), a growing body of evidence has indicated that parasites and pathogens are key culprits involved in widespread disappearance/death and population declines of honeybees (3, 5, 53\u201357). The observation that increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses in infected colonies is associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse supports the argument that virus infections could have a significant negative impact on colony survival. While the simultaneous presence of multiple viruses and asymptomatic viral infections in honeybees as well as lack of a cell culture system for virus production (58, 59) makes Koch\u2019s postulates of disease causality difficult to fulfill, the observed negative correlation between the level of TRSV infections and size of host populations suggests that TRSV, in combination with other viruses, is likely a contributing factor to poor survivorship of honeybee colonies.",

For each tissue sample, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Tag-TRSV-F1 (5\u2032-AGCCTGCGCACGTGGcatgaatgttgttatccaat-3\u2032), where the capitalized sequence corresponding to Tag was published by Yue and Genersch (61). The synthesized cDNAs were then purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by a MinElute Reaction Clean kit (Qiagen) to remove short fragments of oligonucleotides and residue of enzymatic reagents to prevent amplification of non-strand-specific products (28). cDNA derived from negative-stranded RNA was amplified using the Brilliant SYBR green qPCR master mix (Stratagene) with a 0.4 \u00b5M concentration each of the Tag (3\u2032-AGCCTGCGCACCGTGG-5\u2032) and TRSV-R1 primers in a 25-\u00b5l volume according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To normalize the qPCR result, amplification of a housekeeping gene, the \u03b2-actin gene, was performed for each sample with a previously reported primer set (62).",

The amplification efficiencies of the SYBR green real-time RT-qPCR assay for both TRSV and \u03b2-actin were proved to be approximately equal (data not shown). The output of RT-qPCR assays for TRSV in different tissues was interpreted by using the comparative cycle threshold method (\u0394\u0394CT method). The average CT value (\u0394CT) of TRSV in each tissue was normalized using the CT value corresponding to the endogenous control, \u03b2-actin, with the following formula: \u0394CT = average CT(TRSV) \u2212 average CT(\u03b2-actin). The tissue that had the lowest level of TRSV was chosen as a calibrator. The \u0394CT value of each tissue was subtracted from the \u0394CT value of the calibrator to yield \u0394\u0394CT.
