MERS\u2010CoV belongs to the genus \u201cBetacoronavirus\u201d that is an emerging zoonotic virus considered as one of the major public threats and causes severe and fatal respiratory illness in humans.2,3 This infection is different from any other known hCoVs that have the possibility of human and zoonotic transmissions.4 The patterns of transmission and origins of MERS CoV remain unclear, and based on the analysis of different virus genomes, it is declared that it may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past. Although an animal reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. Meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illness in close contacts of patients.5 The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from subclinical infections to severe respiratory diseases and death.6",

However, there are still gaps in the knowledge of this disease, and monitoring and periodical assessment of this emerging infection in an epidemiological study format seem to be necessary. After 8 years from the onset of the MERS-CoV outbreak, this infection is still considered as a public health threat with no vaccine or specific treatment and also with some unknown epidemiological aspects related to it. Strategies to contain the MERS-CoV depends on providing epidemiological knowledge about this infection. This study represents the current epidemiological status (mortality risk, identify potential risk factor, and geographical distribution) of the MERS-CoV in the world in 2019 and identified and highlighted the most probable risk factors related to this infection.",

Most of the cases reported in Saudi Arabia were from Riyadh (71.9%) and in Oman 8.4% from North Al-Batinah (Figure 2). The large proportion of reported cases from this mentioned region highlights the importance of implementation of infection control practices to limit transmission in there. The results of this study are in line with the previous published epidemiological studies,20\u201322 those which declared that Saudi Arabia had been the epicenter of MERS-CoV infection, and during the 8 years from the onset of this disease, this country had always ranked first in aspect of the number of MERS cases and deaths related to MERS-CoV infection with >80% of global MERS-CoV burden among all the affected countries worldwide.",

The design of this survey was cross-sectional so that no causal inferences could be made because the evaluation of the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is limited in such designs. The sample size in this study is low; therefore, there is a probability of a random error occurrence in the results. Possible misclassification in the categorization of MERS cases may be due to the respondents, declaration for example in exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, exposure to MERS-CoV cases, and comorbidity which potentially may occur as a result of the measurement bias. Despite the above limitations, the current global survey may have a number of implications for health care policy by using global data.",

The continuous occurrence of MERS-CoV cases after 8 years from the passes of the disease is critical to a global public health response. Since our knowledge about the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is increasing, there is the need for educational programs, access to the health care setting and early detection of morbid cases with MERS-CoV. By considering the results in the present study, policymakers and local health authorities of the affected countries can modify potential risk factors to reduce the higher mortality rates in MERS patients and also to prevent, respond to and control outbreaks of MERS-CoV.",
