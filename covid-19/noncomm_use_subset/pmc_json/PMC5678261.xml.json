Corticosteroid use is the most common cause of ONFH, and the stage at diagnosis was earlier than those in other groups.[1] There is an obvious dose-duration-response relationship between corticosteroids and ONFH, although it is disputable. An analysis of Mont et al.[2] noted that the incidence of osteonecrosis was 6.7% with corticosteroid treatment of >2.0 g (prednisone equivalent). Despite the similar radiographic staging distribution, their corticosteroid group had a higher incidence of advanced-to late-stage lesions than their noncorticosteroid group.",

Earlier diagnosis may affect patient prognosis, which depends mainly on the stage, location, and size of the disease. Imaging examinations are well known for their key role in the diagnosis, follow-up, treatment planning, and treatment monitoring of early-stage ONFH. Joint arthroplasty is a good choice for the end stage of ONFH, but is not the ideal option for younger and active patients, especially patients with asymptomatic osteonecrosis.

            "text": "Concepts, such as daily corticosteroid dose, daily corticosteroid dose per weight, cumulative corticosteroid dose, and pulse dose, were used as possible measuring indices. The comparative study of Kameda et al.[6] showed that the development of ONFH depended on the response to a high dose of corticosteroid therapy and a decrease in the bone mineral density value in the 1st year. The prospective study of Shigemura et al.[7] showed that a high corticosteroid dosage (>40 mg/d) had a significantly higher risk of osteonecrosis. The study also indicated that adolescent and adult patients had a significantly higher risk of osteonecrosis than pediatric patients. Mont et al.[2] supported that patients treated with daily doses of >40 mg were at a higher risk, with a 3.6% increase in incidence for every 10 mg increase in dose. Saito et al.[8] pointed out a significant dose-response relationship between the development of ONFH and the total dose of steroid administered in the first 2 weeks after renal transplantation. Further, a study showed that their pulse steroid treatment group had a higher rate of avascular osteonecrosis than their control group.[9] The long-term results of multifocal osteonecrosis related to continuous treatment of corticosteroids showed that continuation of peak doses predicted the occurrence of new lesions, and the continuation of corticosteroids without peak doses was a risk factor for a quicker progression to collapse.[10] The available literatures demonstrated that high-dose corticosteroid treatments might increase the risk of developing osteonecrosis, especially in the first 3 months. In addition to intravenous administration, other applications of corticosteroid may induce femoral head necrosis. Corticosteroid is an effective choice for various inflammatory diseases. However, it may be abused to a certain extent without patients being informed, especially the long-acting dexamethasone with longer incubation periods. Children who received dexamethasone had a higher incidence of skeletal morbidity than those who were treated with prednisolone (P = 0.027, odds ratio: 2.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.1\u20135.9).[11] Long-acting corticosteroid use yielded a higher risk of ONFH. There were sporadic case reports on topical steroid application-induced ONFH. Egger and Ballock[12] reported a case of a 10-year-old boy who developed ipsilateral ONFH after long-term inhalational corticosteroid and intermittent short courses of oral steroid use. Moreover, a 34-year-old woman developed bilateral ONFH during the peripartum period after two large intramuscular injections of steroids for fetal lung maturity.[13] Dharmshaktu et al.[14] reported an occurrence of bilateral ONFH with a physiological replacement dose of glucocorticoids in a 38-year-old man with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma.",

A study involving 284 patients taking statins and high doses of steroids at the same time reported a 1% incidence rate of ONFH, which was lower than the usually reported incidence in patients receiving high doses of steroids only.[15] Sakamoto et al.[16] also confirmed the suppressive effects of simvastatin on plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-1) expression and secretion induced by dexamethasone from bone marrow adipocytes, which indicated preventive effects against steroid-induced ONFH. Mattano et al.[17] simply adopted the dose modification method with alternate-week dexamethasone to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in intensified treatment children and adolescents with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Intravenous immunoglobulin as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of some relevant autoimmune diseases may be a good alternative.[18] These attempts require further support from clinical and basic research studies.",

Bone marrow edema on MRI should be considered as a marker for potential progression to advanced osteonecrosis and is different from transient osteonecrosis of the hip and BEM syndrome. A previous case report indicated that osteonecrosis could possibly occur within 3 weeks after initiation of high-dose corticosteroid therapy.[41] MRI evaluation may be useful in following the progression of ONFH. A long-term prospective study showed that serial MRI evaluation might be useful in following up the progression of small asymptomatic lesions of ONFH in patients with SARS.[42] MRI also helps quantify the area and extent of ONFH in different planes and could also be used to guide treatments as a validated technique in following up patients. A previous study appraised the accuracy and limitations of the diagnostic methods for ONFH identification.[43] MRI may improve staging, investigate radiologically occult collapse, depict other causes of disability and pain, assess prognosis, and evaluate treatment; new MRI techniques need further investigations.

However, plain radiograph examination lacks sensitivity in early-stage diseases compared with MRI with a diagnostic window between the onset of symptoms and the appearance of pathognomonic changes. Computerized tomography (CT) is not routinely applied in early-stage lesions. CT plays an important role in detecting subchondral fractures without an apparent focal collapse and in decreasing false-positive diagnosis of MRI findings. CT is also used to detect bone repair and degree. Generally, bone scan is the modality of choice for an early diagnosis but is less specific than MRI in identifying early-stage ONFH.

A review of the progression of asymptomatic osteonecrosis by Mont et al.[44] noted that asymptomatic osteonecrosis had a high prevalence of progression to symptomatic disease and femoral head collapse, while small, medially located lesions had a low rate of progression. This suggested that it might be beneficial to consider joint-preserving surgical treatments in asymptomatic patients with medium-sized or large and/or laterally located lesions. The stage of ONFH and the time from discerning corticosteroid use to the diagnosis of ONFH are important factors in predicting its spontaneous regression. Regression is more likely to occur when earlier-stage diagnosis and shorter-time discernment exist. Discontinuation of corticosteroids does not seem to affect the regression process of ONFH. The underlying factors may also contribute to the prognosis. Different underlying diseases have different prognoses. The review of Mont et al.[44] indicated that patients affected with sickle cell disease had a high risk of head collapse (74%), whereas patients with SLE had a quite low risk (17%). The intervention methods may also play a great role in osteonecrosis progression. Another literature review by Mont et al.[45] covered 42 reports and 2025 hips. Compared with the nonoperative management group, the core decompression (CD) group had a notable effect on the natural history and clinical progression in the early stages of ONFH. Patients with high-risk factors should be suggested to receive preventive methods and regular follow-up in the next 12 months and should be diagnosed early. When following up a patient with osteonecrosis, treatments should be prepared if necessary.",

A research from Europe showed the results of CD in different ARCO stages.[48] ARCO stage I (reversible early stage) or stage II (irreversible early stage) with necrotic lesions located on the medial side or central lesions and area of less than 30% of the femoral head showed better results than those in conservative therapy; CD can be used as a short-term pain relief option in ARCO stage III. Over time, the technique of CD has progressed and involved multiple percutaneous drillings and small trephine diameters. Pierce et al.[49] showed that improved multiple percutaneous drilling techniques had excellent outcomes in conjunction with growth factors in early-and precollapse-stage osteonecrosis compared with traditional CD. Hsu et al.[50] performed a retrospective study to evaluate CD for asymptomatic ONFH, and the result was unpredictable.

The expression levels of BMP gene were analyzed in the normal and necrotic sites of the femoral head.[52] The combination with BMP-7 and/or BMP-2 for the treatment may present more effective means to preserve the femoral head.",

This technique has evolved from the Phemister technique to the Trapdoor technique and Lightbulb technique. Compared with the CD technique, NVBG is more indicated for ARCO stages II and III in the precollapse stage of ONFH. A comparative study that impacted bone graft with or without recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) for ONFH using the lightbulb technique indicated that NVBG was an effective hip-preserving surgery in selected patients and that the rhBMP-2 might improve the clinical efficacy and quality of bone repair.[53] The definite indications are ONFH in the precollapse stages or at least in the early postcollapse stages with less than 2-mm collapse and intact articular surface.",

Based on these excellent results with a follow-up duration longer than 10 years, Eward et al.[54] advised to use FVFG for treating patients younger than 50 years with symptomatic, precollapse-stage ONFH. The failure of FVFG seemed to be related to a negative effect of creeping substitution with the unbalanced bone resorption enhanced by corticosteroids.[55]",

Many studies reported promising clinical results with angular intertrochanteric or trans-trochanteric rotational osteotomy in ONFH; however, it may increase surgical difficulty and reduce surgical effectiveness following end-stage arthroplasty. Porous tantalum rod is a kind of biocompatible material and offers the advantage of providing structural support for the femoral head. The presence of porous rods allows rapid bony ingrowth. Although the clinical results appear promising,[56] the tip of tantalum rods may protrude into the acetabulum if the femoral head collapses, and there is a technical difficulty in the removal of the tantalum rod in case of end-stage arthroplasty.",
