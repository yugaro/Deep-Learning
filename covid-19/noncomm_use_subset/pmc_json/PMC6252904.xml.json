The influenza virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that is segmented into eight (Subtypes A, B) or seven (Subtype C) separate strands. Each segment codes for at least one protein, and based on the extensive studies of the influenza A virus (IAV) in recent years, it seems likely that all subtypes express at least twice as many proteins as its number of segments [3].",

The outer layer of the influenza virus is studded with the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). On the virion, the HA is found in the form of a homotrimer (HA-trimer), while the NA forms into a homotetramer (NA-tetramer). The HA-trimers are relatively evenly distributed on the surface of the virion in the lipid bilayer, whereas the NA-tetramers appear to localize at one end of the virion, most likely at the exit point of the budding virion [4]. Recently, the distribution of the HA-trimers into larger conglomerates was observed; however, the biological consequences of these processes are not well understood [5].",

Over the course of a few generations, the virus can change sufficiently to become virulent. Like many emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8], IAV depends on animal reservoirs, where they can reside [9\u201313] and transfer between species that share the same environment [14]. As one major reservoir involves migratory birds [15], the potential to rapidly spread an infection throughout the world is of major concern and IAV is under constant watch (http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/year/en/). During the past 100 years, there have been three major epidemics with extensive fatalities [16] and one minor one (mostly because of quick action from the WHO and health practitioners) [17, 18], the Spanish flu (1918, H1N1, 75 million fatalities worldwide), the Asian flu (1957, H2N2, 2 million fatalities), the Hong Kong flu (1968, H3N2, 1 million fatalities) and more recently the swine flu (2009, H1N1, 14 000 fatalities).",

We also summarize our current understanding of the infection cycle with a focus on how the viral RNA (vRNA) sequences manage to enter the nucleus of the cell, carry out the transcription and replication process and export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus before the final budding and release of the virion. Finally, considering more than one virion can infect a given cell at the same time, it is also possible to shuffle segments between different viral strains in a process known as reassortment. We discuss briefly on the recent discoveries of RNA/RNA interactions between the vRNA segments that help in the packaging of the viral genome. Such interactions would have implications on the likelihood of such reassortment events.",

The medium-gray/green beads represent the NP (Segment 5 in Table 1), where a polymer of NP molecules forms a scaffold consisting of a right-handed double-stranded (ds) helix of NPs in an ensiform (needle-like) structure [42\u201344]. The single-stranded vRNA sequence is represented by the light-gray/cyan lines (on the 5\u2032 half of the sequence) that connects adjacent NP beads together and similarly the blackish/navy-blue lines (on the 3\u2032 half). Thus, the vRNA sequence is left partially exposed as it winds around the NP-scaffolding; as though the NP forms a lining for the vRNA. The NP-scaffold does not play a significant role in protecting the vRNA because the NP-lined vRNA can be cut by ribonucleases [42]. The only part of the vRNA sequence where any dsRNA base pairing occurs is the highly conserved 12 and 13 nucleotide (nt) sequence on the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-most ends of the vRNA segment, respectively [45]. Likewise, the NP-lined vRNA complex also appears to strongly restrict the formation of RNA secondary structure, though the last section of this review will discuss an emerging nuanced view.",

Nevertheless, either way, the nucleocapsid proteins are PB1, PB2, PA and NP, where NP adopts a needle-shaped scaffold for the ssRNA and the viral polymerase is positioned at one end.

This cluster also appears to be present in the virion during the fusion process (i.e. when the virus enters the host cell), during the budding process (i.e. when the new virion escapes from the cell) and even on entering the nucleus.

It is not presently known exactly what determines whether the virion is spherical or filamentous nor is it clear how the vRNPs combine in the filamentous virion; however, it seems reasonable that the filamentous-shaped virus also preserves this \u20187 + 1\u2019 pattern.",

M1 is partly responsible for the curvature of the emerging viroid, supports the arrangement of the eight RNP on the inner surface of the lipid envelope and regulates the import and export of vRNPs into and out of the nucleus. Anchored to the viral envelope, with part of the peptide sequence occupying the border of the lipid and the nucleocapsid, extending through the lipid layer and jutting out from the surface, are two externally oriented glycoproteins: the hemmaglutinin (HA) and the NA. It is important to keep in mind that none of these envelop surface proteins are monomers. The HA forms a homotrimer (HA-trimer) that binds the sialylated glycans located on the surface of epithelial cells and initializes the process of fusion between viral envelope and the host\u2019s endosome. The NA forms a homotetramer (NA-tetramer) and appears to play a major role in the final steps of the budding process. In addition to these glycoproteins, matrix protein 2 (M2, Segment 7) is a small protein that combines into a homotetramer (M2-tetramer) serves as a transmembrane ion channel (a proton pump). HA and NA are the main antigens of IAV and are used to identify various subtypes of IAV, e.g. H3N2 specifies an IAV with the HA belonging to Subtype 3 and the NA also belonging to Subtype 2.",

The main sialic acid is N-acetylneuramic acid in mammals and birds [56], typically followed by galactose. These molecules can be connected with an \u03b12,6 bond, which is abundant on the surface of cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans, or with an \u03b12,3 bond, which is found in the digestive tract in birds or in the lungs or bronchial tissue in humans. Although sialylated glycans in epithelial cells are studied mostly for their role in disease, the function of such glycans is diverse, interfacing with signaling proteins and various structural and modulatory roles [57, 58], and in epithelial cells in general, defense against oxidative stress [59] and even nutrition [60, 61]. To defend against infections, epithelial cells secrete mucin (mucous) in the respiratory tract [27, 57, 62]. The major components of mucin are glycans terminated with sialic acid together with various antimicrobials compounds [62]. For the virions to traverse the thick mucosal layer covering the epithelial cells in the lungs, the NA-tetramers on the surface of the influenza A virion must cleave through the sialic acid within the mucous [27]. This allows the HA-trimers of the IAV to interact with the sialylated glycans on the apical cell surface [63], an event known as virus adsorption.",

Owing to the process of proteolytic cleavage of the HA0 precursor [64], the HA protein is divided into two subunits HA1 and HA2. HA1 forms the globular head that binds to specific glycans on the epithelial cells. HA2 anchors the HA to the viral membrane and facilitates membrane fusion of the virus with the lipid bilayer of the endosomes, where the virus enters an endosome and the fusion peptide (from HA2) interacts with the lipid bilayer. As a result of lowering the pH in the endosome, the HA subunit adopts a low pH conformation [65]. The fusion process also depends on whether the virion is spherical or filamentous. Binding for the spherical virion triggers the internalization into an endosome, where acidification causes the HA-trimers to aggregate or cluster [26, 66\u201368]. Filamentous virions are, however, too large to fit into a clathrin-coated pit; therefore, they must enter the cell through a process known as macropinocytosis [44, 69\u201371]; a pathway also used by the Ebola virus and SARS virus [8].",

The heterotrimer (PA-PB1-PB2) of each vRNP is drawn to the nuclear matrix, where it can bind to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the C-terminal domain of the large subunit [73]. By hijacking the host transcriptional machinery, the virus can gain access to many of the host\u2019s mRNA processing proteins (the spliceosome complex), the 5\u2032-capped RNA primer sequences, poly(A) tail processing proteins and the host\u2019s NEPs; this recruitment process is shown in cartoon style in Figure 1. The Pol II provides many of the required tools and raw materials needed to build a properly constructed mRNA for export and translation into proteins. One such process is known as cap-snatching [21], where a short primer sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the host\u2019s mRNA is captured and spliced onto the forming viral mRNA (first two panels of Figure 1). Such a primer sequence include the methylated GTP cap (m7GDP), a 13 nt primer sequence that permits binding of NEPs and recruits the associated cap-binding proteins (CBPs). By binding Pol II, the transport proteins are snatched before the host CBP can finish processing the host pre-mRNAs [36, 73]. The ability of the vRNA polymerase to inhibit Pol II may slow down or block important host antiviral responses [48, 74]. Other factors involved in packaging the mRNA and constructing the poly(A) tail are also required and provided by Pol II (last two panels of Figure 1). M1 and NP also appear to bind to the histones of the nucleosome [36], which may be necessary to anchor the viral polymerase during replication processes.",

Nevertheless, based on the images of the RNPs [42, 43], there are some indications as to how the process works. One possible explanation is that the selection is influenced by the different proportions of M1 and NP [76]. In this respect, all processes are essentially transcription and are regulated by these ratios and other factors to establish whether the product will be mRNA or cRNA/ccRNA. Another view [50, 51] is that transcription involves a single viral polymerase, the so-called cis-acting polymerase, which binds somewhere in the vicinity of the promoter region (near the 3\u2032 end of the RNA sequence) and copies the sequence moving in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction [42] and possibly responding to splicing factors, as illustrated in Figure 1 (middle). On the other hand, replication of vRNA requires transcription by an independent viral polymerase transcribing starting from the 3\u2032-most end of the negative-sense viral ssRNA sequence\u2014the so-called trans-acting polymerase [42] (Figure 2).",

Several additional editing steps must be done before a viable mRNA can be exported and translated; the mRNA must have a properly constructed 5\u2032-end on the nucleic acid sequence, a cap with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) and a poly-adenylated [poly(A)] tract inserted at the 3\u2032-end of the sequence. The viral polymerase catalyzes not only RNA transcription but also cleaves the host cell\u2019s mRNA and splices it onto the forming viral mRNA using cap-snatching by way of the PA and PB2 subunits [21]. To do this, the host Pol II and resident spliceosome factors become involved in this transcription process. For example, although M1 is translated from the unspliced mRNA, both M2 and M42 are the spliced variants. Similarly, NS1 is the unspliced version, while the NEP (NS2) is the spliced variant [44]. Additional known splice variants that have been identified in the viral genome are listed in Table 1. The Pol II is also captured to recruit its capping machinery, which provides the required cap and 13 nt primer sequence at the 5\u2032-end of the viral transcript using PA and PB2 (a process shown as the second and third steps from the top in Figure 1). The mimicry must be complete, so that the viral mRNA is processed in the same way as the host\u2019s mRNA. Midway along the vRNA sequence in Figure 1 (middle), one can see an image of various splice factors that introduce the possibility of alternative splicing in the transcription. Just like the host\u2019s own mRNA, by the end of this process, the viral mRNA is probably coated with the host\u2019s exon-junction-core proteins and associated interacting proteins, the cap-binding complex, poly(A) binding proteins and most likely other important proteins needed for export to the cytosol and translation into proteins by the host\u2019s ribosomal RNA [77].",

Both cRNA and ccRNA bind the viral polymerase heterotrimer (PA-PB1-PB2). Hence, cRNA and ccRNA have the NP complex coating onto which the newly synthesized polymerase heterotrimer can bind. As both cRNA and its replication product ccRNA bind the viral polymerase, nuclear export requires a way to distinguish between them and export only the replicated vRNPs. The apparent factor determining this is the binding of M1 to the vRNPs, and not the cRNPs [31, 76]. The export of the newly created vRNPs is further mediated by NEP that directly interacts with NEPs CRM1 (chromosomal maintenance 1, also known as exportin 1) [19, 51, 79], where NEP may enlarge the nuclear pores [80]. Somewhere during the transit (in the cytosol) or somewhere near the point where the individual vRNPs arrive at the cellular membrane, the vRNPs manage to group into the eight segments that form the genome in the 7 + 1 pattern [46]. The selective aggregation of the vRNPs may be because of mutual interactions, proteins factors or RNA-RNA interactions [81], where the latter appears to have some support (see next section). However, the precise secondary structure and the interactions between neighboring vRNPs are unknown.",

This daisy chain connectivity has long suggested that RNA/RNA interactions occur between the vRNPs that help bind them together. Recent observations have shown that there appear to be some distinct RNA/RNA interactions between different vRNPs [83, 84]. In particular, one study [84] revealed that a vRNA hairpin from Segment 2 (the PB1 Segment) and a vRNA hairpin from Segment 8 (the NP Segment) appear to mutually combine via the complementary base-pair sequences of the loops. (Two RNA hairpins bound together by complementary sequences found in their loops are called a \u2018kissing loop\u2019 [85, 86].) The evidence for the kissing loop is supported by sequence alignment methods and in vitro experiments involving disrupting the complementary sequences and measuring the relevant fractions of products via native agarose gel electrophoresis [84]. Hence, the linking of the segments is most likely because of RNA/RNA interactions between adjacent segments. However, these interaction networks of kissing loops also appear to be strain-dependent [84]. This suggests that for a particular subtype of IAV to jump between species, not only does the successful subtype has to acquire specific mutations in HA, access effective nuclear import/export factors and produce proteins that successfully block host innate immunity but, additionally, the subtype requires a proper connectivity between vRNPs. This might partly explain why reassortment of various subtypes is not a common occurrence and how the strains manage to remain unique.",

In this analysis, the functionality of conserved stem-loop structures was directly tested using reverse genetic experiments to introduce synonymous mutations designed to disrupt secondary structures predicted at three locations. These disruptions tended to attenuate the infectivity of the recombinant virus. The disruption of the stem-loop structure at nucleotide positions 219\u2013240, 950\u2013964 and 967-994 of Segment 7 (M Segment) showed a significant temperature dependence, which is characteristic of decrease in RNA stability in these regions.

Sequences of this segment were obtained from the influenza database at https://www.fludb.org [88]. The spectra represent scanning for RNA secondary structure over a window size of 200 nt and, based on the predicted suboptimal structures obtained in the scan, detecting regions where a particular secondary structure motif of RNA repeatedly appears in many (or most) of the optimal and suboptimal structures. The very dark gray/blue boxes represent regions of stable RNA secondary structure that are largely independent of the scanning window size, and segments of highly variable secondary structure are shown by their lack of any color. (The very short gray/magenta boxes indicate the center of the hairpin in the stable (gray/blue) regions of the spectra.)

Modifying the settings\u2014such as changing the scanning window length or the Kuhn length (a measure of the stiffness of the RNA [89])\u2014generates similar results.

However, the kissing loop reported in Gavazzi et al. [84] can also be examined in this way. Figure 5 shows a scan of Segments 2 and 8 for the same corresponding vRNA sequence reported in [84], strain A/finch/England/2051/1991(H5N2). The same default settings are used as above for vswindow/Genepoem. Likewise, in Figure 5, the two connected semi-opaque gray/green boxes is used to indicate the corresponding sequence ranges reported in Gavazzi et al. [84], and the dashed lines indicate the connection between Segment 2 and Segment 8. Though both Segment 2 and Segment 8 are clearly visible in the spectrum\u2014indicating that the structures are relatively stable\u2014the intensity of the gray/blue in these regions is less than some other cases in the same spectrum. This lower intensity gray/blue indicates that there is a greater degree of variation in the RNA secondary structure in these locations. In line with the observation that the linking together of vRNPs is the result of kissing hairpins, this may suggest that there are many such contacts regularly dispersed along the vRNA segments that act like a bar code that defines how the pieces should be fit together with one another and identify the vRNPs specific to a particular strain. Though this may diminish some of the long-held fears of facile reassortment of the common flu with such strains as H5N1, it also could explain how individual strains evolve and compete with one another too.",

The figure shows the time-dependent and structural relationships of the vRNP and associated viral polymerase, which consists of the subunits PB1, PB2 and PA (from genome Segments 2, 1 and 3, respectively). The viral polymerase binds to the partially complementary 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the vRNA segment. The progression is from top to bottom. (Top) The vRNP has entered the nucleus of the host cell and has separated from other vRNPs. (Next step) The transcription is initiated by PB2 hijacking a 5\u2032 cap from the host pre-mRNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage of the host pre-mRNA by PA. (Next frame) Transcription begins from the 3\u2032 end of the vRNA sequence with the spliced-in primer sequence and cap merged onto the forming mRNA sequence. (Next frame) Transcription continues with the viral polymerase somehow dislodging the NP in its wake to obtain the mRNA transcript. Also depicted faintly are alternative splice factors from the spliceosome that can influence the resulting transcription. (Next frame) While the transcription process is happening, the vRNA and NP tend to recombine back to the rest state. (Final step) The poly-adenylation step is reached where further editing is required of the structure using the host RNA polymerase II system. It is important to remember that during this entire process, various mRNA packaging proteins are being recruited (e.g. the CBP. These are shown as a faint covering of the final mRNA. All this packaging is required for transport to the cytosol for translation into viral proteins. The schematic is inspired from [44] and [42]. The structure of the vRNP is based on the right-handed helix in [42]; however, it is important to remember that [43] reports a left-handed helix.

(Top) The vRNP has entered the nucleus of the host cell and has separated from other vRNPs. Perhaps at this stage, the vRNP has become anchored to chromatin, though this is not specified. (Next step) The 3\u2032 terminus of the vRNA segment somehow unwinds and the trans-acting viral polymerase captures this free segment and begins copying the sequence in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction, making an antisense copy of whatever template is present. (Next frame) The process continues with the viral polymerase somehow unwinding the vRNA + NPs, all the while recruiting new NPs for the copy. (Next frame) When the replication is complete, the structure is eventually released. There are several steps in the trans-acting model that are not fully determined yet.
