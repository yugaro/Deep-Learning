However, it was important to have a high faculty-to-participant ratio in order to replicate the high level of supervision that occurs when monitors supervise donning and doffing techniques in the clinical setting. Potentially, faculty requirements could be reduced by using core teaching faculty in the monitor role in the one-to-one donning and doffing sessions. Participants could also perform this role, provided they were instructed in the monitoring process in advance. We utilized a high-fidelity simulation environment for our simulated patient experience station, but most of the course objectives could be achieved in a lower-resource setting by omitting this station if the facilities are not available. The 4-hour program length was necessary to allow for repeated practice of a very complex donning and doffing process with many specific steps to complete.",

Protocols were revised as newer equipment was received, limited by a challenged supply chain as demand outweighed supply from numerous vendors from October 2014 until February 2015. For example, based on drills and exercises, we converted from one respirator brand to another that provided clearer communication and improved cooling. These protocols may vary between institutions and may be revised and altered within single institutions over time. It is important that centers implementing this course establish what the local protocols for PPE use are and adhere to them in order for the training to be applicable to the health care professionals in that institution. At the same time, we also encourage institutions to follow nationally and internationally accepted protocols as closely as possible.16",

When originally designing our program, we hoped to include full training on management of a breach. However, it was felt that this was a higher-level training objective, more suited to the monitors (trained clinical observers), and therefore, this content was removed from the course. Our participants were instructed that if a suspected breach occurred, they would be directed by their trained observer. We decided to leave this question in our feedback survey and found that confidence was increased in this area. We feel this represented a level of confidence in the system of donning and doffing in pairs with an observer guiding.",

Ideally, implementation of this program should include shorter sessions of follow-up training at regular intervals. No clear guidance for frequency and modality of training for health care workers in this intensive scheme exists, and our models are based on information garnered from national centers of excellence (Emory University, the University of Nebraska).17 Nongovernmental organizations' national and international efforts should be directed toward outlining standards to define competency, training modalities (functional and tabletop exercises, simulation, web-based training, didactics, etc.), and frequency of those modalities. Medicine can look to other industries, including aviation, as the gold standard for competency measurement and evaluation.",
