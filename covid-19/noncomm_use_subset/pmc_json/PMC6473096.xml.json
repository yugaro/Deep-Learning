In Korea, short consultation time in tertiary hospitals is attributed to 1) low reimbursement rate and the fee-for-service system, 2) patients' preference for a tertiary hospital, and 3) lack of gate-keeping or a referral system.",

It is remarkable that this project was not a government-led policy; instead, it was a hospital-led pilot project propelled by the awareness of expert groups about the distorted healthcare delivery system. This 6-month study took place in the largest public tertiary hospital in Korea, which exhibited an average consultation time of merely 3.3 minutes for first-time patients. Patients with first-visit consultations for serious and non-curable diseases (four serious diseases: cancer, stroke, coronary artery disease, and rare and intractable disorders defined by regulations) in the outpatient clinic were assigned to an in-depth consultation group or a control group.

PCC is a concept opposite to illness-oriented medicine, because, in the former, physicians view each patient as possessing a unique personality. Recently, involving patients in decision making is becoming an imperative component of PCC.13 Since the national health care system and payment system differ across countries, it is important to define and spread the practice of PCC to assess the quality of care in Korea. Although sufficient consultation time for shared decision making is essential for PCC, the distortion of the healthcare delivery system has led to the coining of the popular phrase \u201c3-hour wait for 3 minutes with the physician\u201d in Korea. Patients' satisfaction1415 as well as physicians' concentration and emotional control16 are thus decreased under the prevailing healthcare system. The present pilot project on \u201cin-depth consultation over 15 minutes\u201d proposed a basic model for developing a Korean version of PCC by identifying the interactive needs of physicians and patients, and demonstrating that sufficient consultation time is necessary for patients with serious and rare diseases.",

Because physicians are not rewarded for expanding and exceeding consultation expectations, the \u201c3-Minute Consultation\u201d remains a reality. In the present pilot project, the consultation time was the only variable factor affected by increasing the government-determined compensation fee for in-depth consultation. As a result, patient centeredness and shared decision making was imbibed and the quality of the consultation improved significantly. This indicated that sufficient consultation time was the most potent factor for facilitating PCC and physicians' satisfaction.",

Furthermore, we cannot compare our findings to those obtained from other countries because of differences in healthcare systems. Additionally, type of disease, duration of disease, and patient's residence can subjectively influence patient centeredness. Lastly, we did not investigate the quality of the consultation, which is an important factor. It could have been measured by audio- or videotaping the consultations, but this was not captured or evaluated in our study due to the use of a self-report questionnaire.",
