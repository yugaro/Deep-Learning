Although sleep disturbances are present in all age groups, the prevalence of sleep disorders in the elderly is high due to the normal aging process as well as comorbidity with various physical and mental disorders [2-9]. Advances in the circadian rhythm due to aging affects sleep in the elderly, usually characterized by waking up early and feeling excessively sleepy in the afternoon. Changes in circadian rhythm are a direct cause of sleep disturbance [3,10], and are associated with circadian rhythm sleep disorders, especially advanced sleep phase type (ASPS) in the elderly [11].",

The MSW and MSF can be calculated through the MCTQ responses, and the MSFsc can be calculated through the MSW and MSF. The MCTQ uses MSFsc as a chronotype indicator, with higher MSFsc reflecting stronger eveningness tendency. Previous studies have found that MSFsc is associated with DLMO [20,21], the melatonin secretion cycle [22], and MEQ scores [21,23,24]. In particular, Zavada et al.

We used the Korean MCTQ, which has been validated for young adults in their 20s and 30s (under review) [36]. The MCTQ measures various sleep parameters such as bed time (BT) and lights off (LO) on weekdays and free days, respectively. MSFsc was used as a marker of chronotype in this study. For the purposes of this study, we modified the first question (i.e. \u201cDo you have a regular working schedule?\u201d) into \u201cDo you sleep differently on weekdays and free days?\u201d because Korean older adults aged 65 and over may not have different sleep schedules on weekdays and free days. Participants who answered \u201cno\u201d to this question completed only to the free days portion on the MCTQ.",

This is consistent with previous studies that show that while evening types are more common in younger adults, there is a larger proportion of morning types in the elderly as sleep patterns are advanced with aging [26,47,48]. Specifically, decreased sensitivity of the retina and weakening of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) lead to a decrease in light acceptance and changes in circadian rhythm [10,49,50], and as melatonin secretion and the amplitude of circadian rhythm decrease, many elderly report various sleep problems [11,51-53].

The MSFsc in this study was 2.23, which was more advanced compared to previous studies. The difference of MSFsc in this study across studies compared to our sample may be due to the high proportion of females in our sample. Cain et al. [55] found that the time of body temperature and melatonin secretion was earlier in women than in men, indicating an earlier circadian rhythm in females compared to males.",

These results are similar to evening types in younger age groups in previous studies [16,19,58-60]. While our study categorized our sample into morning types and other types, this categorization is arbitrary as people fall on the spectrum of eveningness and morningness. Considering this continuum, our results suggest that some individuals grouped into other types in our study may have more eveningness tendencies than their counterparts of similar age, but display advanced sleep patterns due to sleep changes with aging. Although elderly participants with other types had a higher depression score than their counterparts with morning type, this difference was not statistically significant. This may be due to the fact that the current sample included the elderly who visit local community elderly centres. They engage in daily activities and have more social support, which may serve as a buffer against depression. Additionally, the sample size for other types was small. Taken together, our results suggest that the elderly group requires clinical interventions for other types (intermediate and evening) compared to morning types. Further studies should investigate whether being an intermediate and evening type may warrant interventions that are similar to evening types in younger age groups, as evening types are rare in elderly populations.",
