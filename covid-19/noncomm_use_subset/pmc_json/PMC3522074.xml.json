            "text": "Molecular diagnostic techniques for viral testing have experimented a rapid development during the last years [1], and have been introduced in the majority of laboratories as a new way for the diagnosis of human pathogens like viruses. This field of molecular microbiology presents many challenges to the practice of laboratory medicine, above all the implementation like automated methodology. The introduction of fully automated devices with faster turnaround times has allowed clinical laboratories the necessary tools to report sensitive and accurate results to physicians. The goals in performing microbiology nucleic acid tests (NAT) are mainly to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost. Rapid results obtained by NAT are associated with improvements in patient care. Empiric data and modeling studies find that faster detection of enteroviral meningitis using NAT is associated with reduced length of stay and duration of antibiotic administration, as well as substantial cost savings [2]. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [3] for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range [4, 5]. A great number of qualitative and quantitative molecular virus assays, mostly based on PCR technology have been described [6, 7]. NASBA assays could identify active infection by detecting viral messenger RNA (mRNA) but the most widely used tests in clinical virus diagnosis are quantitative real-time PCR techniques [8]. Many molecular diagnostic methods have been replaced by automated devices that use less time, manipulate smaller volumes of liquids and provide quantified results with better precision. Molecular techniques have revolutionated the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly the diagnosis of viral diseases. Automation of these methods provides decrease in turnaround times, low contamination risk, ease of performance and speed, as well as the ability to have lower detection limits and to diminish cost per test. This review focuses on the application of molecular technology in the clinical virology laboratory.",

The initial step in a bDNA assay is to ensure that viral particles have been disrupted and that viral RNA is present for analysis. Target-specific oligonucleotides are then hybridized to the target nucleic acid, and other regions hybridize to multiple bDNA amplifier molecules that create a branched structure. Finally, the bDNA signal is the chemiluminiscent product of the reaction [11]. The signal in the bDNA assay is proportional to the number of labeled probes bDNA assays for the quantitation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA are commercially available (Bayer HealthCare, Diagnostics Division, Tarrytown, N.Y.).",

The PCR product is detected by using fluorescent dyes that preferentially bind to double-stranded DNA. The specificity of real-time PCR can also be increased by using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes in the reaction mixture. Another approach to real-time PCR is the use of dual hybridization probes that uses two specially designed sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Finally, detection and quantitation of amplification products can be carried out with molecular beacons. Real-time PCR decrease the time required to perform nucleic acid assays because there are no post-PCR processing steps.

In these assays, two primers are designed which hybridize to the target sequence. Several methods can be used to detect the cleavage products, but Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) probes and a second invasive cleavage reaction to detect the target-specific products is the most common technique used. FRET occurs due to the interaction between the electronic excited states of two dye molecules. FRET probes are a pair of fluorescent probes placed in close proximity. The excitation is transferred from one dye molecule to the other without emission of a photon. The acceptor fluorophore emits light which is detected in specific channels. This technology is currently available for HCV genotyping.",

A second pair of primers is used in a cycling reaction, using a thermostable DNA ligase. Both ligated products can then serve as templates for the next reaction cycle, leading to an exponential amplification process similar to PCR amplification. Detection of ligase chain reaction product could be carried out by means of several methods such as autoradiography and fluorescence. One of the advantages of the fluorescent detection system is that it is relatively easy to quantitate the amount of the ligase chain reaction product. Other methods for the detection of ligase chain reaction products in microtiter plates are been also used. LCR assays have been developed for the detection of viruses such as HPV, HSV and HIV.",

The pattern of hybridization can identify the sequence of PCR, if the number of probes is sufficiently large. The results of hybridization between the bound probe and labeled sequences in the sample applied and tested are revealed by scanning or imaging the array surface. Confocal microscopy is used to scan the chip, detecting fluorescent signals that reveal hybridization at precise locations on the chip.

Because of this, there is a need for a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for HSV CNS diseases, so CSF PCR testing has been evaluated as a diagnostic test for HSV encephalitis and meningitis, being a rapid and a very high sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tool [48]. However, because neither the sensitivity nor specificity is 100%, HSV PCR results should be interpreted with caution. False-negative HSV PCR results could be possible and false-positive HSV PCR results can be also possible due to eventual contamination.

However, currently the main application of nucleic acid test in the management of these viruses, above all hepatitis B and C, is the detection of serum or plasma viral load of these viruses for monitoring therapeutic responses of infected patients. Assays to quantify hepatitis B and C virus load in liver tissue have also been described [83, 84]. HBV DNA detection and HBV DNA viral load are also essential to explore a viral reactivation. Real-time PCR quantification assays are widely used because of their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, broad dynamic range and positive predictive values. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined international standards [85]. However, because of these techniques do not use the same HBV primers, follow up of patients should be carried out with the same technical assay in order to compare viral DNA load evolution. With respect to the HBV genotypes, there is currently a need to perform it due to several factors such as the prediction of clinical outcomes and the association with response to interferon treatment [86]. Genotyping of chronic HBV infections can help practicing physicians identify those at risk of disease progression and determine optimal anti-viral therapy. Methods to determine the viral genotypes are based on hybridization and sequencing, and genotype affiliation rely on phylogenetic analyses.",
