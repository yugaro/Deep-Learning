            "text": "In 2008, over 2 million cases of cancer worldwide (approximately 20% of all tumors) were associated with one of a number of infectious agents: 10 viruses (papillomavirus; hepatitis B and C viruses; polyomaviruses BK virus, JC virus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus [MCpyV]; Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]; human herpesvirus 8; T-cell leukemia virus type 1; and human T-cell leukemia virus type 2), one bacterium (Helicobacter pylori), and two helminths (schistosomes and liver flukes) which are major contributors to cancers as etiological agents (1). Considering the thousands of microbial species that comprise the normal human microbiome (2), it is likely that the microbe communities can substantially influence normal physiology, as well as the causes of (or major contributors to) and response to diseases (3), including cancer. These effects are the subject of intense investigation in tissue systems known to have resident microbiomes, which include the gastrointestinal tract (4\u20136), skin (7), and airway (8\u201310), and in immune and inflammatory responses (11\u201314). Microbiome profiling is also examining the less obvious roles for microbes and their presence in unexpected locations. Some examples that are relevant but not limited to cancer include modulation of tumor microenvironments (15) and dysbiosis of bacterial populations in breast cancer tissues (16).",

However, this will work only for bacterial species with amplicons that survive population PCR but not for viruses or eukaryotic microorganisms. 16S rRNA sequencing can also be used to screen large sets of samples but may have difficulty in discriminating between strains or reporting the presence of genomic variants or pathogenicity factors. Deep sequencing of the total DNA from a sample can certainly identify bacterial, viral, and other microbiome members (3, 17, 18) but with a severe penalty in efficiency. Even if the field attains the as-yet-unrealized goal of a cost of $1,000 per genome, total DNA sequencing will be an expensive method for screening hundreds or thousands of experimental and control samples to detect associations of pathogens with a particular disease. Depending on the specimen sampled, the data may overwhelmingly be from host human sequences, creating an unnecessarily large search space for locating pathogen signatures and resulting in the majority of sequence reads being discarded.",

This report describes development of the PathoChip platform containing probes for all known publicly available virus sequences and hundreds of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and helminths, providing wide coverage of microbial pathogens in an economical format. Where possible, multiple probes to independent regions of the target genome are used to improve an opportunity for detection. Furthermore, while the PathoChip content was developed from sequences to known targets, the ability to discover new strains or organisms is provided by the inclusion of probes to sequences that are conserved within and between viral families. To this end, a previously unknown virus with homology to a conserved sequence may produce a corresponding hybridization signal from such a probe, if not to a complete probe set. A supporting workflow is described for profiling large collections of tumor samples typically available as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in biobanks and includes simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA to expand the range of targets available for hybridization.",

Agilent custom probe design algorithms built for comparative genomic hybridization applications were used to identify 5.5 million probes from the metagenome. Over 3 million of these probes were predicted to have low risk of cross-hybridization with a human genome sequence. Importantly, a subset of these probes that map to unique target regions of the selected pathogens was synthesized on PathoChip v2a microarrays, and a separate subset that covers regions of sequence conservation between at least two or more viruses was synthesized on PathoChip v2b arrays (Fig. 1B). An enhanced feature of the PathoChip v2b was the inclusion of 2,085 probes tiled throughout the lengths of 22 accessions for agents known to be tightly associated with human cancers.",

The manufacturer confirmed that cell lines used to prepare the male and female SureTag human reference DNA were infected with this virus to generate the cell lines. EBV detection in tumor screening assays that used this reagent was therefore possible if the signals were not normalized to EBV probe signals to the xhh Cy5 channel.

The sliding window analysis recapitulated AccSig results and highlighted the differences between detection events for full or partial HPV16 genomes.

Many HPV16 probes also passed the outlier test, indicating that although the signals are consistently different from background, the population\u2019s range of intensities is wide and therefore also contains outliers. In contrast, fewer HPV18 and HPV26 probes were significant by t test, reflecting the much lower apparent occurrence of these genomes in this tumor population (Table 3). However, the outlier analysis easily identified the relatively larger number of probes that produced HPV18 or HPV26 detections by AccSig or MAT score in a few positive samples. For these rarer candidates, some probes were significant by t test because they produced lower but consistent signals over background throughout the population, which may be an account of copy number of genomes present and is not surprising.

The pools were mixed with a panel of biotinylated DNA probes that included HPV16 probes. Pooled DNA that hybridized to the probes was captured by magnetic streptavidin beads. Deep sequencing of libraries derived from the captured material produced a number of reads that map with high homology to the HPV16 genome (Fig. 6A), and these reads were enriched for the regions targeted by the capture probes but also included distal sequences. Mapping individual reads from each library showed that very few HPV16 templates were present in the sample pool containing only tumors that were HPV16 negative by PathoChip or p16 assays (pool 1, Fig. 6A and C). More HPV16 templates, up to 73 in pool 3, were observed in the libraries from HPV16-positive tumors. Interestingly, there were regions of high reads which showed high intensities in the majority of the tumors analyzed. The E4 region which was prevalent in the majority of the tumors (Fig. 6A to C) may provide a window into the transcription profiles of HPV16 in these particular type of OSCCs. The oncogenes E6 and E7 also showed a high number of signals in the tumors, but not as dramatic and surprising as the E4 open reading frame (ORF) region. However, this may be an interesting discovery which suggests a higher number of transcripts for the E4 ORFs in these tumors than was previously thought. Notably, the E1 region also showed greater signals in the tiled probes across the HPV16 genome. Predominantly, E4 seems to be the most prominent signal for the OSCC tumors and suggests a greater involvement of E4 in maintenance of the tumor by HPV than previously indicated.",

            "text": "The ability of a highly multiplexed, metagenomic assay to detect small nonhuman genomes in an overwhelming background of human sequences will be affected by several factors, including nucleic acid extraction and recovery, target size and copy number, participation in amplification reactions if used, and specific probe performance. The last three factors likely contributed to the differences in assay performance, in which 10,000 copies of JC or BK polyomavirus (5-kb genomes in a 4-kb double-stranded circular DNA plasmid vector) were detected with probe intensity ranges of 61 to 4,889 (JC virus, 42 probes) and 4 to 442 (BK virus, 9 probes). In contrast, adenovirus type 5 (36-kb genome, double-stranded linear nonintegrated DNA) was detected over an intensity range of 342 to 65,325 using 63 probes and 100 target genome copies; differences in genome size and conformation may affect participation in whole-genome amplification reactions. Furthermore, probes clearly have different hybridization affinities despite sharing the same bioinformatic design criteria. PathoChip assay sensitivity will therefore vary across accessions and between protocol options, but the inclusion of multiple probes per accession and integration of candidates from different levels of data analysis provide avenues for optimizing the chances of detecting a pathogen in the screening projects. The HPV16 genome, for example, is a 7.9-kb double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) circle and was detected by 67 of 68 probes with intensities ranging from 217 to 31,475 in a naturally infected tissue specimen (OSCC no. 2022).",

The results of the assay were highly concordant with the molecular pathology reports for p16 overexpression and in some cases suggested that an HPV strain other than HPV16 may be responsible. HPV16 detections by PathoChip assays were confirmed by PCR using primers that are independent of PathoChip probes and by recovery and sequencing of HPV16 regions located outside those targeted by capture probes on the HPV genome.",

If sufficient target copies are present in a sample, inferences regarding genomic structural variation and RNA expression levels may be possible. For HPV16, probes mapping to early gene transcripts produced more overall signal than those for late genes in OSCC samples; this is consistent with studies of actively infected cells and the oncogenic effects of E6/E7 expression (32, 33). Moreover, the transcription of HPV at the level of detail that we are probing here is greater than previously investigated and suggests a potential role for other transcripts, including the E4 ORF and related antigen, in maintenance of the transformed state in the tumors. Signals from probes to late gene sequences were similar to or somewhat higher than those of probes to intergenic HPV16 sequences. Therefore, the boost in early gene signals is likely due to the RNA portion of the sample target preparation. Among the early genes, strong signals were observed for E6/E7 sequences, and for the E4 region of E2, which is known to be a highly abundant RNA splicing product from the primary transcript (34). Detailed interpretation of these data is complicated by the ability of HPV16 to exist in episomal and multiple host-genome integrated forms (35), but probe signal differences within and between tumors will provide the identification of potential agents having oncogenic activities and so lead to new lines of investigation as a follow-up to the initial screening experiment.",

The sliding window analysis generally matched AccSig results but provided better ability to distinguish variants within the set of samples and offers the potential to detect candidates represented by only a portion of an accession. As used here, the MAT algorithm did require more labor because it was applied to each sample in separate operations, but this could be addressed by future automated scripting. Analyses at the individual probe level helped to explain how candidates arose in the AccSig and MAT results and are likely the only way in which previously unknown pathogens with some sequence homology to a conserved (or specific) probe can be detected. Thus, a PathoChip screening project can generate a list of candidates prioritized by the magnitude of detection, detection via multiple analysis strategies, and the rate of detection across the sample population. Combining these results with annotations for the virus or pathogenic microorganism such as host range, tissue specificity, or prevalence in the general population will assist in determination of which agents deserve further attention. This approach is likely to provide a signature of a particular cancer or disease with agents with various degrees of contribution. A window into the natural conditions for commensal and pathogenic organisms will greatly enhance our ability to diagnose and treat cancer and other possible diseases not yet linked to specific agents.",

These events can lead to proliferation early in the infection process as well as over an extensive period during which the contributions by these agents may vary or have specific effects on the host cell important for disease development. The data analysis workflows will test for statistically significant interactions between these infectious agents.

Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), with dual indexing and bead library normalization according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. After Qubit quantitation, libraries were submitted to the Washington University Genome Technology Access Center (St. Louis, MO) for quantitative PCR (qPCR) quality control measurements, library pooling, and sequencing on one flow cell of an Illumina MiSeq instrument with paired-end 250-nt reads. Approximately 400,000 reads from the six OSCC libraries generated were aligned to the PathoChip metagenome or the human genome using the Bowtie2 aligner (36) in sensitive-local mode. Reads mapping to HPV16 with MapQ scores of 20 or better were identified using Integrative Genomics Viewer 2.3.25 (37).",

A subset of Acc3 probes show high signal in tumor 2 (middle), perhaps due to strain sequence differences or partial deletion of the genome, reducing the all-probe accession average and making detection more difficult. In this case, a sliding window analysis of local probe signals is not biased by accession annotation and may be more sensitive for candidate identification.
