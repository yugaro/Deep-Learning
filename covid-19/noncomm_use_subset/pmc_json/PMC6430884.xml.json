Historically, electron microscopy (EM) was considered the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus in feces.5, 6 Because of the expertise and equipment required for this technique and its inability to characterize viruses beyond the family level, EM has been augmented in clinical settings by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as this test provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to document the presence of ECoV in feces of horses.1\n",

It is well established that clinically affected horses shed ECoV in feces for 2\u20105 weeks after infection, 3, 7, 8 although longer periods have been described.8 The virus also is demonstrable in feces of unaffected horses during outbreaks, suggesting that inapparent carrier horses or transient shedding of ECoV may occur.1, 3 Coronaviral\u2010induced disease is associated with stress in other adult large animals.9, 10, 11, 12 Subclinical carriers and fecal viral load appeared to be minimal in other continents,13, 14 and seroprevalence in the United States was reported to be low (<10%).5 However; the incidence of fecal viral shedding in healthy, unexposed horses in the United States remains unknown. As a result, ECoV\u2010positive fecal samples are difficult to interpret on their own. Thus, the diagnosis of ECoV infection currently relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease in horses with clinical signs of ECoV along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue.3, 7 Although this approach is complete, it poses an additional financial burden to the horse's owner. In addition, with this approach, diagnosis may not be achievable in places where testing for multiple equine enteric pathogens is not readily available. Thus, our aim was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. Based on the fact that ECoV outbreaks have not been reported in referral hospitals, we hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses would be low. Fecal samples from horses presented to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (WSU\u2010VTH) for evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases or those that were anesthetized for imaging were collected for this prospective study.",

After the breed distribution of the WSU\u2010VTH equine admissions, Quarter Horse was the most common breed included in our study. Although they made up for almost half of the sampled horses, many other breeds (Warmblood breeds, Thoroughbreds, Arabians, Draft breeds, Miniature horses, Mustangs, Morgans, and Pony breeds) were included in the study, providing a varied breed representation. The number of stallions was significantly lower than the other sex and reflects the equine population routinely admitted to our hospital. A wide range of ages was included because there appears to be no age predilection for this infection in adult horses.5 Horses in the Anesthesia group were significantly younger than horses in the Gastrointestinal Disease group. This is likely because horses undergoing limb imaging usually are actively performing and therefore are younger. As expected, based on the normal distribution of admissions to our hospital, most horses included in the study were admitted during fall and spring. A 2\u2010year sample period was used to account for year\u2010to\u2010year viral shedding variation that may have occurred and to include a larger number of horses. In addition, this period allowed us to evaluate multiple seasons. Although colder months (October to April) appear to be associated with a higher incidence of infection,7 the only PCR\u2010positive horse with clinical signs consistent with ECoV was admitted during summer indicating that this disease may occur any time of the year and supporting the sporadic nature of this viral infection reported by others.7\n",

Hence, all negative results were considered truly negative. In addition to PCR, all of the fecal samples collected in the study also were analyzed using EM.
