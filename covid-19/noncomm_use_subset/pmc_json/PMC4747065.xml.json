            "text": "Compared with a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke causes a 1.5-fold greater loss of disability-adjusted life-year [1]. Nonetheless, over the past decade there has been a clear and impressive decline in the incidence of stroke in several Western nations [2-5]. The positive change in the occurrence of stroke in these countries has been attributed primarily to better screening and treatment of established risk factors for stroke, particularly hypertension [6]. The burden of stroke is greater in Asian countries than in the Western world, including a substantially higher incidence of stroke than myocardial infarction [7-9]. However, data on the extent to which several Asia countries have recently fared with regard to improvement in stroke outcomes are relatively sparse. One study suggested the incidence of stroke decreased from 1961 to 2000 in Japan [7] and an overview study revealed that recurrent stroke decreased in each decade from 1960 to 2010 [10]. Certainly more nationwide data on the evolving nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia are needed for research and planning purposes. The objective of this study was to explore risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke using the entire population in Taiwan by National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).",

A prior study validating the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in National Health Insurance claims data using the Taiwan Stroke Registry as a reference revealed a positive predictive value of 88.4% and sensitivity of 97.3% [11]. Another cross-sectional study showed that among confirmed cases of acute ischemic stroke in a hospital medical record, 94.5% were assigned \u2018ischemic stroke\u2019 as the principal diagnosis in the NHIRD [12]. We only enrolled patients receiving brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during hospitalization with the assumption that all patients with symptoms of acute stroke should receive brain imaging. This approach was intended to exclude stroke patients who were hospitalized for rehabilitation during chronic stage. Although brain imaging, especially CT, may not be able to reveal the cerebral infarction in patients with symptoms or signs of acute stroke, it can easily exclude intracranial hemorrhage. Thus NHIRD had a low probability of misclassifying hemorrhagic stroke into ischemic stroke if brain imaging was done.",

However, a very small proportion of patients, likely those with minor stroke, may receive brain imaging at emergency departments or outpatient clinics but not be hospitalized due to various reasons, such as non-availability of beds or patients not wanting to wait. We found both incidence and recurrence of stroke dropped in May and June in 2003, which was during the fierce SARS epidemic in Taiwan. During that period of time, patients and medical doctors were less inclined to facilitate hospitalization unless the patient\u2019s condition was highly severe. Thus many patients with strokes of relatively minor severity may not have been counted in our analysis thereby potentially underestimating the real incidence and recurrence of ischemic stroke during that period of time.",

While the current study included only first-ever ischemic stroke, the prior study [15] also included 34% recurrent ischemic stroke patients, which may have led the treating medical doctors to adopt a more aggressive vascular risk reduction strategy. Also hospitals participating in a stroke registry are presumably highly motivated to improve care quality and may generally have more awareness of/interest in the use of evidence-based therapies for stroke risk reduction. We found mortality rate was lower in this study, as compared to the prior stroke registry study (1.9% vs. 4% [15]) which is likely due to the fact that this study only enrolled first-ever ischemic stroke.",

Among hospital admissions with stroke as the primary diagnostic code during 2001 to 2009, hospitalizations for ischemic stroke increased substantially in Korea [16]. This apparent rise in annual ischemic stroke incidence in Korea was likely due to an increase in the country\u2019s elderly population [16]. However, the median age of the current study in Taiwan did not change during the study period. Moreover, a comparison of survey data obtained in 2002 vs. 1993-1996 showed a significant improvement in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in Taiwan, which may have contributed to its declining incidence of ischemic stroke [17]. Ischemic stroke incidence in the population aged 35-74 years was 226 per 100,000 person-years (including first-ever and recurrent ischemic stroke) in Korea 146 per 100,000 persons in our population aged 18 years or older (first-ever ischemic stroke only); while the annual rate of recurrent ischemic stroke was about 5.0% in Japan during 2007 to 2009 vs. a 7.7% annual recurrent stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) rate noted in Taiwan [18].",

Our study had similar frequencies of stroke risk factors except only 10% patients had atrial fibrillation in this study. Since diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in hospitalized ischemic stroke patients typically relies on a single baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram or history of atrial fibrillation, it is conceivable that the frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in admitted ischemic stroke patients in Taiwan might be underestimated. Among ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation in this study, 34% vs. 10% in a Chinese ischemic stroke registry [20], received oral anticoagulants during hospitalization. The underuse of oral anticoagulant therapy in eligible Asian stroke patients during hospitalization may in part be due to concerns about hemorrhagic transformation. Also, 31% patients received statin therapy in this study at discharge vs. 35% in Fukuoka stroke registry, which is highly comparable [21].",

The difference may exist in the prior study excluded patients with atrial fibrillation or severe carotid stenosis [10] while this study included all first-ever ischemic stroke patients. Also, people participating in clinical trials may receive more rigorous risk factors control, which turns out to have lower recurrent stroke. Furthermore, the current study enrolled patients in the acute stage when the risk of recurrent stroke is high, whereas secondary stroke prevention trials, in general, enrolled patients after the acute stage. We found the one-year recurrent stroke was declining from 2000 to 2011, which may be explained by increasing use of statin (8.8% to 30.8%), antiplatelet agents (76.1% to 86.6%), and oral anticoagulant agents in atrial fibrillation (30.0% to 34.5%) during hospitalization among this period of time.",

However, it would seem that the magnitude of reduction for incident stroke seen in Western nations of approximately 20% was much greater than the more modest 9% decrease noted in Taiwan. We observed a rise in the use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and oral anticoagulant agents for atrial fibrillation in Taiwan during this period of time, which probably contributed to the declining rate of stroke, but there appears to more room for improvement in risk factor control if Taiwan hopes to gain at least the same level of decrease in incident stroke observed in Western countries.",
