Given the speed, sensitivity, and ability to avoid convalescent blood samples, the value of RT\u2010PCR is evident. However, serology with well\u2010timed acute and convalescent samples remains the most sensitive diagnostic method as shown in previous studies and confirmed in the current work.24, 25 Of the 99 RSV infections identified, 55 (56%) were diagnosed by serology. The second point is that RT\u2010PCR testing of sputum provided significantly improved diagnostic yield for all viruses compared with nasal samples alone.26 The range of added value varied from a low of 11.8% for rhinovirus and a high of 50.0% for RSV and adenovirus. Testing sputum may be particularly important for patients who have been ill longer than several days and present for medical attention when virus may no longer be detectable in upper airways but has spread to the lower respiratory tract. Notably, sputum was collected in 69% of cases in this multicenter trial, indicating that it is feasible and valuable in patients with COPD.",

As in other studies, rhinovirus was the most frequently detected pathogen, although approximately 50% occurred during routine nonillness visits.27, 28, 29, 30 In contrast, the detection of RSV and most other viruses was uncommon during well visits. When using only multiplex PCR for diagnosis, the percent of samples testing positive for RSV was equivalent to influenza A, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses. Coronavirus detection rates ranged from 8.5% to 10.6%, and although occasionally detected during well visits, most were detected during illness. We and other investigators have shown coronaviruses to cause serious illness in persons with the underlying cardiopulmonary disease, yet, they remain an underrecognized pathogen in adults.31, 32\n",

Influenza with abrupt illness onset and fever tends to drive patients to seek medical attention within several days.5 The typical RSV illness begins with a cold and progresses over several days to dyspnea and wheezing. The average time to seek medical attention is 5\u20106 days by which time virus may no longer be detectable in the upper airways.33, 34 In addition, because RSV infection in adults represents reinfection, a rapid amnestic antibody response may obscure a rise in antibody if acute sera collection is delayed. Finally, because the analysis of acute and convalescent sera is not possible in patients that die, results may have been biased toward milder illness.",
