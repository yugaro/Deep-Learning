We designated specimens as \u201cOg\u201d or \u201cIs\u201d based on\nthe respective originating cave name, Ogayu (39.6019N, 141.2508E) and Isari (39.6771N,\n141.0881E), and we also assigned them numbers. The Ogayu cave is an abandoned gold mine called\nManju. The Isari cave is located at the Atago shrine, which is approximately 16 km away from\nthe Ogayu cave. Feces were homogenized with sterile phosphate buffered-saline solution\ncontaining penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericine B. Viral RNA was extracted from feces\nhomogenates by the single-step guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method [1]. cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed as described\npreviously [3]. The PCR primers IN-6 and IN-7 were used\nto amplify the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoV as described\nelsewhere [5]. We also performed a second-step PCR using\nthe IN-6 primer and a reverse primer (5\u2032-ATCAGATAGAATCATCATAGAGA-3\u2032) described previously\n[2]. PCR products of expected size were obtained in\neight of 38 samples, after the second-step PCR. Five of the eight positive samples were\nderived from bats roosting in the Isari cave, and the rest were from the Ogaya cave. These\npositive PCR products derived only from the samples of little Japanese horseshoe bats were\nsubjected to nucleotide sequencing as described previously [3]. CoV RNA was not detected in the other three bat species. Virus isolation using\nthe Vero cell culture derived from an African green monkey was unsuccessful, probably due to\ninappropriate choice of cell culture.",

Comparison between the six CoVs from little\nJapanese horseshoe bats and those from DNA databases revealed that the nucleotide sequences\nhad the highest identity (about 91% nt) to bat SARS CoV strain Rp3 (GenBank accession no.\nDQ071615), which was isolated from fecal swabs of Pearson\u2019s horseshoe bats (R.\npearsonii) in Guangxi Province, China in 2005 [4]. Nucleotide sequences aligned using Clustal W [10] were analyzed by the neighbor-joining method [7]. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the six CoV sequences detected in little\nJapanese horseshoe bats have a monophyletic relationship to the SARS CoV in the same lineage\nof the group B betacoronavirus (Fig. 1). Bat SARS CoV or SARS-like CoV has been detected in rhinolophid bats on the Eurasian\ncontinent [4, 6].",
