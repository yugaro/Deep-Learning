The ICD code was the most specific diagnosis variable; however, only one, if any, ICD code was recorded for a presentation. A hierarchy was applied in the order of variables presented above, where presentations were first classified using the principal diagnosis. Those presentations that were missing a principal diagnosis were classified using the symptom code, those missing both a principal diagnosis and symptom code were classified using the diagnosis at discharge and so on down the hierarchy. We maintained specific diseases as their own category if the group was large enough to analyse (category size ranged from 710 to 118 251 presentations). Other less common conditions were grouped with similar conditions, for example, sinusitis and pharyngitis were included in other upper respiratory diseases. We also identified presentations that could be related to respiratory infections (eg, febrile convulsions) and respiratory infection symptoms (eg, wheeze/cough/crackles). Finally, some chronic conditions were specifically included to capture conditions that may have been masking other acute respiratory conditions or been inaccurately diagnosed due to similar symptoms (eg, chronic bronchitis). Our coding of the clinical diagnosis and symptom information resulted in 17 ARI categories. Online supplementary table 1 lists the categories with the numbers of associated presentations, the proportion of ED records that the category represented and the variables and codes used to populate the category. A hierarchy was applied in the order presented to make the categories mutually exclusive as text variables could potentially place records in two or more categories.",

The POBW measure was used as an appropriate measure of fetal growth as it takes into account the gestational duration, fetal gender, maternal age, maternal height and parity.18 As the location of the EDs were not available, residential postcode at birth was used to stratify data into geographical regions. The SEIFA used for this study was the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD), which indicates relative access to resources and ability to participate in society for households within the same collection district (approximately 200 dwellings) using information from the latest census.19 The IRSAD incorporates measures of disadvantage that can be offset by the included measures of advantage.

To limit the likelihood that children presenting to ED may have moved from their geographical region at birth, we restricted analyses presented by region and risk factor analysis to children aged <5 years at time of presentation. Aboriginal status was identified using a validated algorithm in all available records for an individual.20 Seasonal distributions of presentations were examined by stratifying records by month of presentation. Annual presentation rates were calculated using the year of presentation and tested for linear age-specific annual trends over the study period using negative binomial regression. We also used negative binomial regression to calculate adjusted incidence rate ratios where the outcome is the frequency (number) of ARI presentations in the first 5 years of life for the infant and the exposures are maternal and sociodemographic risk factors. We explore the impact of all potential exposure factors at the same time in separate models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. To account for intragroup correlation with children presenting multiple times, we used the clustered sandwich estimator.21 Data cleaning was completed using IBM SPSS Statistics, V.24, with statistical analyses conducted in STATA V.14 and EpiBasic V.3.22",

The burden in Aboriginal children was especially high, with similar disparity to non-Aboriginal children as is observed in hospitalisation rates,7 demonstrating the ongoing burden of disease in this population. There was some evidence of geographical disparity with the highest rates observed in the Northern and Southern rural regions. The monthly distributions depicted one late winter peak in numbers of ARI presentations (in July/August) in metropolitan WA and most of the rural and remote geographical regions except the Kimberley, with its tropical climate, having a bimodal distribution peaking in March and August. Risk factors for presenting to emergency with an ARI were similar in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The geographical disparity in ED presentation rates, with higher rates observed in children from most rural and remote regions in WA was consistent with findings focused on influenza among all ages in New South Wales.8 Reasons for the disparities include relative access to general practitioners and hospitals in the different regions. In particular, we have seen here increases in ED presentation rates in remote areas across all ages. It is unclear whether these increases represent a true increase in disease burden, or increases in data capture in remote areas, and there is a lack of primary healthcare data from general practices and rural and remote health clinics for comparison.",

While for some groups the higher risk of presentation to ED for an ARI is likely because the disease incidence is higher (eg, preterm children), for others it could be lack of access to other primary healthcare providers, such as general practitioners in rural and remote areas. Indeed, the rate of general practitioners in rural and remote areas ranges from 53/100 000 population in the Pilbara to 141/100 000 population in the Kimberley compared with up to 171/100 000 population in Perth\u2019s inner metropolitan area.26 The risk factors for presenting with ARI to ED were similar to those previously reported risk factors for admission to hospital for ALRI including being male, being born preterm, being from a low socioeconomic area and maternal age <20 years.7 Two previously observed risk factors for ALRI hospitalisation, maternal smoking and higher number of previous pregnancies7 were not risk factors for presenting to ED with overall ARI. This suggests maternal smoking is associated with increased severity of disease or specifically with lower respiratory infections. Different to hospitalisation, presentation to ED may be more influenced by individual psychological and social factors of the child\u2019s parents or carers. Parents may be less likely to take their child to ED if they have had experiences with similar conditions in their older children and are more confident to manage their child\u2019s illness at home. Conditions presented to ED are likely to vary more in severity, whereas hospitalisations tend to be only the very severe cases and the decision to hospitalise is more likely to be made by a clinician.",

            "text": "Croup is a major reason for presentation to ED but has not been found to be a common diagnosis in hospitalisation.7 Rates for other specific conditions seemed low when compared with hospitalisations. This is likely a result of the high use of non-specific codes in ED, as most cases of respiratory infections are admitted with non-specific diagnoses and either discharged without testing or admitted while investigations or results are still pending. Most patients in ED will be managed based on clinical presentation, and specific diagnoses might be left to the admitting team to clarify. Rates for specific conditions are therefore likely to underestimate the burden and comparisons with hospitalisation rates for specific conditions should be made with caution. The uncertain accuracy of ICD codes in administrative datasets has previously been documented in other data linkage studies.5 8 27 McCallum and colleagues5 noted from data linkage work that ED presentations for pertussis were likely to be missed if only coded pertussis is included due to misclassifications with other respiratory conditions and use of symptom codes for diagnosis coding. Similar results have been found when routine laboratory data are linked with hospital diagnosis data, with certain respiratory pathogens identified across a range of respiratory diagnoses28 and 38% of laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for respiratory infections not having a respiratory infection ICD hospital diagnosis.27 The non-specific nature of the diagnostic coding also makes the severity of conditions in the ED unclear. While some presentations for severe conditions have an ICD code indicating this (eg, whooping cough), others could be just as severe but be coded as \u2018respiratory disease\u2019. This is particularly likely in some remote regions that do not appear to use ICD coding. Across regions, ICD coding was available for 81% of records in metropolitan WA and in rural and remote areas ranged from 26% in the South-West to 3.4% in the Kimberley. In contrast, use of the very broad major diagnostic category in rural and remote areas ranged from 56% in the South-West to 96% in the Kimberley, versus only 12% in metropolitan WA. This highlights the inconsistencies in diagnostic practices across WA that make regional comparisons difficult and are important considerations for population-based surveillance in WA. As relatively higher proportions of Aboriginal people live in rural and remote areas compared with non-Aboriginal, rates for specific conditions may be highly underestimated in Aboriginal children. This may be why rates for some conditions, such as croup, were higher in non-Aboriginal children. Use of ICD coding in the data systems also changed over the period, with a notable increase occurring in the rural systems. Sufficiently sensitive diagnosis of ARIs in ED is likely to improve the ability to survey and manage specific conditions. The level of laboratory testing in ED is currently unknown, and linkages with laboratory data will aid in understanding the burden of specific respiratory infections. While testing results will underestimate the true burden of the specific ARIs because only a proportion of children who present are likely to be hospitalised or tested, it will help us to interpret the non-specific coding used in ED.",

There is a lack of primary healthcare data with diagnostic information in the community in general, and these ED data will be important for understanding where to target prevention strategies and form the baseline for evaluating policies.",
