There are four compartments constituting mosquito population dynamics including 1) pre-adult mosquitoes composed of eggs, larvae, and pupae and 2) adult mosquitoes that can be divided into susceptible (Sm), exposed but not yet infectious (Em), and infectious dengue virus-carrying mosquitoes (Im) based on infectious status (Figure 1A). On the other hand, the susceptible-exposed infectious recovery compartmentalized disease transmission model was implemented to simulate the dengue virus transmission within human populations (Figure 1B).",

The extrinsic incubation rate (\u03bdm) can be an index of mosquito vector competence and is deeply dependent on temperature change.36,37 Capturing all aspects of the disease is a daunting task, but newer temperature-dependent parameters that incorporate a more holistic view of the viral ecology can be implemented as new information on transmission models.",

In general, the dengue transmission pattern in Taiwan is unique compared to other Southeast Asia countries that has been repeated annually: beginning with imported case from Southeast Asia countries in the early summer, spreading out through southern Taiwan in fall, and dying out in winter because of the cold weather with temperatures dropping to below 15\u00b0C. The summer weather in southern Taiwan is hot and wet, which provides perfect conditions for vector A. aegypti to thrive and facilitate the dengue transmission. Since annual dengue cases emerge in early summer, the authorities concentrate mainy on physical and chemical interventions (eg, breeding site clean-up and pesticide spray) during summer, dengue transmission is under controlled.43 If the control measures are not successful, the outbreak then spreads out gradually and peaks around October. Compared with the conditions in summer, the frequency and strength of dengue control measures are reduced during late fall and temperatures drop to below 15\u00b0C during late winter, which may lead to a little higher dengue burden in early winter compared to that in late summer.",
