The PsVNA50 titers for individual vaccination time points (V2, V3\u2013V4, V6\u2013V8) of Tc-bovine nos. 2314 and 2316 were published previously [13].

In contrast, the FRNA50 and ELISA rGP (ELISA units [EU]/mg) titers had <2 times difference between all SAB-139 lots. The ELISA rNP titers were not detectable in any lot of SAB-139 (Table 1).",

Irrelevant Tc-hIgG did not induce human monocytes or neutrophils for ADMP, antibody-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) or activate NK cells (as measured by expression of CD107a and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 proteins after degranulation) above the background levels established with normal saline (Figure 1A\u2013C). The Tc-bovine sera antibodies (with all antibody classes) recruited ADMP activity above background after V2, yet ADMP activity gradually decreased after each subsequent vaccination (V3\u2013V8) (Figure 1A). In contrast, Tc-bovine serum antibodies recruited ADNP activity above background after V2, but ADNP gradually increased after each subsequent vaccination (V3\u2013V8) (Figure 1B). Natural killer cell degranulation, as demonstrated by all 3 protein markers, was induced above background after V2, and the activity was sustained after each additional vaccination (Figure 1C).

To determine whether total IgG or an IgG subclass was associated with a specific function, Spearman coefficients were used to determine correlation. The ADMP activity had a significant positive association with total EBOV GP-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 but not IgG4, suggesting that ADMP activity is driven in part by antigen-specific antibody titer (Figure 1A and E). In contrast, neither ADNP nor NK cell degranulation/activation strongly correlated with any subclass, suggesting that the extent of induction of these functions is not solely based on antibody titer. To determine whether the ability of antibodies to induce a given function is associated with induction of other functions, correlation analyses were performed. Induction of ADMP activity did not strongly correlate with any other function (rs <0.5), yet ADNP activity and NK cell degranulation and activation displayed moderate-to-very strong positive correlations (rs \u2265 0.5) with each other (Figure 1B, C, and E).",

A likely explanation is that the affinity of Tc-bovine anti-EBOV IgG1 antibody clones continues to mature during the adaptive immune response after successive vaccinations that target both EBOV/Makona-specific epitopes and EBOV-conserved epitopes. This result likely indicates that Tc-hIgGs derived from plasma from later vaccinations are more potent than those derived from earlier vaccinations.

Results from the recently completed phase I clinical trial in healthy adults for SAB-301 (anti-MERS CoV) [18] indicated that it was well tolerated, but further studies in humans to determine safety and/or immunogenicity will be needed for SAB-139 and other Tc-hIgG products.",

For example, ADNP is initiated after IgG-immune complex Fc binding to the activating receptor Fc\u03b3-RIIIB [40], which shares the same extracellular domain and therefore similar binding profiles to IgG as Fc\u03b3-RIIIA. In contrast, ADMP is driven through IgG-immunocomplex Fc binding to both the activating receptors Fc\u03b3-RIIA and Fc\u03b3-RIIIA [41]. Thus, differential binding of the SAB-139 IgG antibodies may be related to the differences in Fc-receptors used to drive ADNP and/or ADMP. Natural killer cells only express Fc\u03b3-RIIIA, and, similar to ADNP, activated NK cells degranulate (CD107a expression) [41, 42] and produce cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and the chemokine MIP-1\u03b2 to induce ADCC of infected cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that ADCC may contribute to the efficacy of some monoclonal antibodies against EBOV [43\u201345], and both NK cells and monocytes have been implicated in protection against EBOV [46, 47] disease in NHP models.",

Therefore, SAB-139 should recruit innate immunity effector cells/activity in humans. In addition, the IgG1 subtype, a potent activator of ADCC, comprises 90% of SAB-139 compared with the typical range of 60%\u201370% in human-derived IVIG products [48]. The ability of IgG1 and/or IgG3 antibodies to induce multiple Fc-domain-mediated effector functions, termed polyfunctionality, has been associated with elite controllers of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection. This polyfunctionality may have relevance to the efficacy of immunotherapeutics against EBOV and other viral agents [49, 50]. Therefore, SAB-139 may activate more global effector-cell responses in humans than is functionally possible from animal-derived IVIG (nonhuman Fc regions) or human-derived IVIG (proportionally less IgG1).",

More importantly, all infused doses of SAB-139 were well tolerated in all NHPs even when the animals were highly viremic. The results also indicate that low-dose, lower-potency SAB-139 (V3\u2013V4) delivered 1 d after EBOV infection or higher dose, higher potency SAB-139 (V6\u2013V8) delivered 5 d after EBOV infection provided limited or no protection. Of note, NHPs from the LI group were already highly viremic and had blood chemistry abnormalities before or at d 5 postinfection. Therefore, EBOV infection was advanced by the time Tc-hIgG therapy was initiated, and most NHPs succumbed within 2 d (d 7 postinfection) after treatment. Better survival may have been obtained had we delivered more of lower potency SAB-139/V3\u2013V4 at d 1 postinfection or higher potency SAB-139/V6\u2013V8 at d 5 postinfection, respectively. Alternatively, a more compressed dosing schedule could be implemented up to and including single administration of the total planned dose on the first d of treatment to improve efficacy. However, although this dosing schedule may be practical in a human patient care scenario, administration of such a volume to sedated NHPs in a BSL4 setting was not practical due to time or logistical constraints. A study with a smaller group of NHPs could answer this question.",

This lack of adapted immune response was indicated by the death of the majority of EI NHPs (5 of 6) but none of the DI NHPs (0 of 4) at back-challenge (Experiment 2, Supplementary Table 8S). Fatalities occurred in the EI group despite the presence of anti-EBOV GP antibodies at back-challenge and a history of transient anti-NP antibodies during the postprimary infection recovery phase. The mechanism(s) preventing adaptive immunity is not known. We conjecture that SAB-139 delivered 1 d, but not 3 d, after infection bound and masked the epitopes of EBOV GP antigen while also stimulating innate-immunity effector cells via Fc receptor binding causing the release of immunomodulating cytokines. This masking then prevented T and/or B cells from developing an adequate protective-adaptive immune response. However, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism(s) of this observation.",

SAB-139 was efficacious in neutralizing virus in vitro, strongly induced innate immune effector functions, and protected NHPs from EBOV disease. These results suggest that SAB-139 may be effective in treating human-EBOV infection and could progress into clinical evaluation. As a response platform for new and emerging infectious diseases, the current manufacturing process can produce GMP Tc-hIgGs 75 d after immunization begins with existing or experimental plasmid DNA, recombinant protein, or whole-virus vaccine. Methods to further reduce production time are being considered and investigated. These methods include prepriming the Tc-bovines with vaccines against known pathogens of interest, prime-boost combinations with different vaccines, new adjuvants that increase or accelerate the immune response, and further genetic engineering to improve the adaptive immune response and human-antibody yield. Finally, future in vitro and in vivo studies that compare SAB-139 with other anti-EBOV antibody products in animals and/or humans should be considered.",
